However, the one thing that you should note is that resetting Windows 11 will remove all apps that you have installed on your device. Hence, make sure to backup your essential apps and data before resetting your PC.
So, these are the best and the most effective methods to repair the corrupted Windows 11 files. If none of the methods worked out for you, you need to reinstall Windows 11 on your device.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-install-multiple-apps-using-winget-with-winstall-on-windows-10-1000225/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Revolutionize Your Windows 10 Experience: Learn How To Install Multiple Apps Simultaneously with Winget and Winstall!</span></a>
