Are you ready to unlock your inner craftsman and create stunning leather pieces in Windbound? Leather crafting is a timeless skill that has been handed down for generations. With a little practice and patience, anyone can become a skilled leatherworker.\nHere’s a complete guide to help you master the art of crafting leather in Windbound.\nGathering Materials The first step in leather crafting is gathering all the necessary materials. You will need rawhide or animal hide, which can be obtained from animals in Windbound.\nOnce you’ve collected a sufficient amount of hide, you need to craft a tanning rack. This can be done by gathering materials like sticks, stones, and grass. Place these items in your crafting menu to build a tanning rack.\nWith your tanning rack in place, place the rawhide on the rack to begin the tanning process. This will transform the rawhide into usable leather.\nCrafting Tools To craft leather items, you’ll need certain tools. These include a leatherworking station, needles, dye, and wax. Crafting a leatherworking station is similar to crafting a tanning rack, just with different materials. You will need sticks, stones, and additional materials like grass rope, vines, or shells.\nOnce you’ve crafted a leatherworking station, you can start working on your leather crafting projects. You can craft a variety of items like leather shoes, bags, and even armor.\nCrafting Techniques To create different types of leather items, you will need to master a variety of crafting techniques. Some essential techniques include cutting leather into the desired shape and size, piercing holes, and stitching pieces together. You’ll also need to learn how to properly use the dye to get the color you want and how to apply wax to protect and preserve the finished product.\nPractice Makes Perfect Now that you have all the necessary materials, tools, and techniques, it’s time to start practicing. Take the time to master each technique and experiment with different types of leather crafting projects.\nStart with simple projects and gradually move on to more complex ones. With each project, you’ll gain more confidence and experience, allowing you to create even more impressive leather items.\nConclusion Leather crafting in Windbound is an excellent skill to have, both for utility and aesthetic purposes. With a little practice, patience, and dedication, anyone can become a skilled leatherworker.\nGather the materials, craft the necessary tools, and master essential techniques to unleash your inner craftsman and create stunning leather pieces in Windbound. Happy crafting!\nWhile playing Windbound, you will need some leather during your journey. It is a resource in some crucial crafting recipes but where to find Leather in Windbound? Is it a natural resource or do you have to put in some work to make it? Get all the answers you need in this guide on how to make Leather in Windbound.\nHow to Get Leather in Windbound To answer the first question on your mind, yes, animals are a source of leather (of course). You can get animal skin as a drop from animals after you fight them and eventually beat them. You can fight smaller animals like pigs to avoid putting yourself in too much danger. But you need to remember that not all skin drops can be made into leather.\nNow, once you have got your hands on some animal hide, you have to do the next step. That is to dry it out. You need to basically cure it over fire and that’s where the campfire comes in.\nHow to Make a Campfire Don’t know how to make a campfire in Windbound? Don’t worry, it is pretty easy. You need 1 thick grass, 1 stick and 2 rocks for it. Gather these resources and craft a fire from the Crafting menu. It will be in the Survival section as you can see in the picture above.\nAfter crafting the fire, you have to build it wherever you like. Next, you need a Drying Rack. It can hold up to 3 items at a time. That can be crafted with 2 sticks and 3 thick grass. This will come in handy to cook items on the fire including raw meat.\nOnce you have that, you have to interact with the fire and add the skin to the Drying Rack. Now, it is a waiting game because it will take some time to make the leather. With this newly learned technique, you can make use of leather in a variety of items like an axe, glider, Plainstalker bow, armored bag, bone tipped spear and more.\nSo, here’s a short recap:\nGet a skin from an animal Make a fire and create a Drying Rack Dry out the skin to make Leather in Windbound That’s everything you need to know about it.
