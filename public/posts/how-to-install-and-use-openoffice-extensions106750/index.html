In this article, we will teach you how to unlock the hidden power of OpenOffice by learning how to install and use extensions in minutes.\nWhat are OpenOffice extensions?\nExtensions are plugins that add specific features, functionalities, or capabilities to OpenOffice. They are designed to enhance the core functionality of the OpenOffice application, making it more useful for different types of users. The great thing about extensions is that they are open-source and available for free.\nThere are different types of extensions available, such as language support, spell check, templates, productivity tools, and more.
