It is a way to share our thoughts, opinions, ideas, and experiences with the world. However, running a blog is not always an easy task, especially when it comes to hosting. Hosting a blog requires technical skills, money, and time. But what if we told you that you could host your blog for free using Jekyll and Github Pages? Yes, you heard it right! In this article, we will explain how to revolutionize your blogging game and host your blog for free using Jekyll and Github Pages.\nWhat is Jekyll?\nJekyll is a static website generator that allows you to create a website or blog using plain text files. It helps you to transform simple text files into a well-structured website. Jekyll is an excellent choice for bloggers who do not want to deal with the complexity of content management systems (CMS) like WordPress but still want a powerful and customizable website.\nWhat is Github Pages?\nGithub Pages is a web hosting service that allows you to host your website or blog for free. It is based on the version control system Git, and it is connected to your Github account. Github Pages is a great choice for developers or bloggers who want to host their static websites, blogs, or documentation.\nHow to Host Your Blog for Free with Jekyll and Github Pages?\nStep 1: Create a Github Account\nThe first step to hosting your blog for free with Jekyll and Github Pages is to create a Github account. Go to Github.com and sign up for a free account.\nStep 2: Create a New Repository\nAfter creating a Github account, the next step is to create a new repository. Go to the Github dashboard and click on the “New” button. Name your repository as “username.github.io”, where username is your Github username. This naming convention is essential for Github to recognize it as a Github Pages repository.\nStep 3: Install Jekyll\nThe next step is to install Jekyll on your computer. Jekyll requires Ruby version 2.4.0 or higher. If you do not have Ruby installed on your computer, download and install it from Ruby-lang.org. After installing Ruby, open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command to install Jekyll:\ngem install jekyll bundler Step 4: Create a New Jekyll Site\nThe next step is to create a new Jekyll site. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:\njekyll new my_blog This command will create a new Jekyll site named “my_blog” in your current directory.\nStep 5: Edit Configuration File\nAfter creating a new Jekyll site, the next step is to edit the configuration file. Open your Jekyll site directory in a text editor and navigate to the _config.yml file. Edit this file according to your preferences. You can change the site title, description, author name, URL, and other settings.\nStep 6: Choose a Jekyll Theme\nJekyll comes with default themes that you can use for your blog, or you can choose to use a third-party Jekyll theme. Navigate to the _config.yml file and change the theme. You can find Jekyll themes on Github or theme-gem-based Jekyll themes.\nStep 7: Push Your Jekyll Site to Github\nThe final step is to push your Jekyll site to Github. Navigate to your Jekyll site directory on your computer, open the command prompt or terminal and run the following commands:\ngit init\rgit add .\rgit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\rgit remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git\rgit push -u origin master Replace the “username” with your Github username. This command will create a new Git repository, add all the files, commit them, add a remote Github repository, and push the files to Github. Wait for a few seconds, and your site will be live at http://username.github.io.\nConclusion\nHosting a blog has never been easier with Jekyll and Github Pages. In this article, we explained how to host your blog for free using Jekyll and Github Pages. We hope this article has helped you to revolutionize your blogging game and start your blog without worrying about hosting costs. Happy blogging!\nIf you’re looking to start a blog, chances are the first name you’ll encounter is WordPress. There’s a reason for that. WordPress is incredibly flexible and powers huge websites as well as small ones. The thing is, not every website needs such a powerful infrastructure, especially a simple blog.\nSmaller, simpler, and cheaper options are available. GitHub Pages, for example, is free for personal use. Combine that with Jekyll, a static site generator, and you have everything you need for a blog. Even better, it’s free.\nBefore you get started You’ll be running Jekyll on your own computer, and only macOS and Linux are officially supported. We’ll be covering both operating systems here, and the Linux instructions may work with the Windows Subsystem for Linux running Ubuntu. That said, it hasn’t been tested.\nYou’ll also want access to a good text editor. TextEdit or GEdit will do, but you might want something more robust. We’ve taken a look at several great cross-platform text editors in the past.\nThings you should know You should have at least a passing familiarity with the command line. Being familiar with git and GitHub will be necessary as well. If you’re not familiar, we’ve got a guide to git, and GitHub’s own documentation is excellent.\nFinally, Jekyll utilizes Markdown, which lets you write in plain text but present your content in HTML to the user. You should be familiar with Markdown, or at least willing to learn it. This may sound daunting, but Markdown is easy to learn (we even have a cheatsheet for it).\nInstall Jekyll and its dependencies This has been tested on macOS Mojave and Ubuntu 18.04. If you’re running another version of either operating system, you may need to check the Jekyll website for further information.\nmacOS Before you can install Jekyll, you need to install the XCode command line tools with the following command:\nSelect Install and wait for the installer to complete. Now you can install Jekyll and Bundler:\nWhen you run this command, you’ll see a warning similar to the one below:\nWARNING: You don’t have /Users/YOURNAME/.gem/ruby/2.3.0/bin in your PATH, gem executables will not run.\nNote the version number. Assuming the above message, run the following commands, substituting the correct version number if it differs:\nUbuntu Before installing Jekyll, you’ll need to install the build tools with the following command:\nAs with macOS, we want to install and run from the home directory instead of as root. Run the following commands:\nNow install Jekyll and Bundler:\nTest your Jekyll installation To make sure everything is up and running, run the following:\nIf everything has installed correctly, you’ll see a message with the version number. If instead you see a message like command not found, see the Jekyll documentation.\nSet up your new blog with Jekyll Now that Jekyll is installed, creating your new blog is simple:\nYou can use any name you want in the above command instead of blog. This is simply the name of the directory Jekyll creates. Now cd to the directory that you just created, and run the following command:\nThis will launch your new blog about running locally on your computer. Open the URL displayed in your browser to take a look at the site. As you can see, there’s some work to do. Press Ctrl + C to stop.\nCustomize your blog To edit the site title and other information, open your blog directory and edit “_config.yml”. The various options here are fairly obvious. Now if you want, you can edit your home page, which is the “index.md” file, though this is optional.\nTo get started writing your first blog post, open the “_posts” folder and you’ll see a sample post. Open this up and edit it, or duplicate it to create a new post.\nDeploy your blog to GitHub Now that your site is set up locally, it’s time to take it online. If you don’t have a GitHub account set up already, sign up and get git installed and configured on your computer. Next, create a new repository with the name username.github.io, replacing “username” with your GitHub username.\nNow open your terminal and cd to your blog folder. Run the following commands.\nNow you should be able to visit username.github.io and see your new blog. If it doesn’t show up right away, wait a few minutes and try again.\nNext steps The steps above are just the basics to get you up and running. Jekyll has plenty to offer, so be sure to check out the documentation. There are also a number of themes available to spice up the look of your blog.\nThere are further steps to take with GitHub Pages too. Enabling HTTPS support used to be a more complex process, but now can be done in your repository settings. Setting up your own domain name is a simple process as well, and GitHub has a great guide on how to do so.\nOne final thing to keep in mind is that it’s a good idea to check site changes locally before committing them to your repository. Simply run the bundler command we used earlier to look at your site on your computer. This will help you catch everything from typos to Markdown syntax errors.\nKris Wouk is a writer, musician, and whatever it’s called when someone makes videos for the web.\nOur latest tutorials delivered straight to your inbox\n","wordCount":"1606","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alexandria Nichols"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-host-your-blog-for-free-with-jekyll-and-github-pages-505588/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionize Your Blogging Game: Host Your Blog for FREE with Jekyll and Github Pages Now!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 27, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1606 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Alexandria Nichols</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#before-you-get-started>Before you get started</a></li><li><a href=#things-you-should-know>Things you should know</a></li><li><a href=#install-jekyll-and-its-dependencies>Install Jekyll and its dependencies</a><ul><li><a href=#macos>macOS</a></li><li><a href=#ubuntu>Ubuntu</a></li><li><a href=#test-your-jekyll-installation>Test your Jekyll installation</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#set-up-your-new-blog-with-jekyll>Set up your new blog with Jekyll</a></li><li><a href=#customize-your-blog>Customize your blog</a></li><li><a href=#deploy-your-blog-to-github>Deploy your blog to GitHub</a></li><li><a href=#next-steps>Next steps</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Revolutionize Your Blogging Game: Host Your Blog for FREE with Jekyll and Github Pages Now!</p><p>Blogging has become an essential part of our daily lives.
