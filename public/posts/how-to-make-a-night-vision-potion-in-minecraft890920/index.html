Do you want to become the ultimate ninja in your Minecraft game? Do you want to be able to roam through caves and dark forests without fear of getting lost or ambushed by enemies? Well, then it’s time to learn how to craft a mind-blowing night vision potion in Minecraft!\nNight vision potions are essential for those who want to explore the game’s world at night, especially if they don’t have access to torches or other sources of light. These potions will give you the ability to see much further in the dark, allowing you to find your way through even the darkest of caves and forests.\nSo, without further ado, let’s learn how to craft a night vision potion in Minecraft!\nStep 1: Obtain Blaze powder To begin, you’ll need to obtain some Blaze powder. You can find Blaze monsters in Nether Fortresses, and they drop Blaze rods when killed. Conversely, breaking a blaze spawner will drop up to 2 blaze rods, which you can then use to craft Blaze powder.\nStep 2: Create a Brewing Stand Once you have Blaze powder in your hands, you’ll need to create a brewing stand. This will require three Cobblestone blocks and a Blaze rod. To create the Brewing Stand, place the Cobblestone blocks in a “V” shape on your crafting table and place the Blaze rod in the middle slot.\nStep 3: Add Water Bottles to Your Brewing Stand After creating a brewing stand, you’ll need to add water bottles to it. You can make water bottles by filling Glass bottles with water placed in a crafting table.\nStep 4: Add Blaze Powder to Your Brewing Stand Now it’s time to add Blaze powder to your brewing stand. Place one Blaze powder into the top slot of the brewing stand. This will create an Awkward Potion.\nStep 5: Add Golden Carrot to Your Brewing Stand Next, you’ll need to add a Golden Carrot to your brewing stand. Golden Carrots will provide Night Vision as well as increase saturation levels. Golden Carrots can be obtained by crafting a carrot with a gold nugget.\nStep 6: Wait for the Potion to Brew Once you’ve added the Golden Carrot to your brewing stand, the night vision potion will begin to brew. The duration of the potion depends on how long you leave it to brew.\nStep 7: Collect Your Night Vision Potion Finally, once the brewing process is complete, you can collect your night vision potion. Just right-click on the brewing stand with an empty Bottle to collect the Potion. Voilà, you now have the power of night vision in your hands.\nWrapping-Up In conclusion, unleashing your inner ninja in Minecraft requires the proper tools, and crafting a night vision potion will certainly help you do so.
