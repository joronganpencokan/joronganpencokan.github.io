Halo Infinite, the much-anticipated next installment in the Halo series, promises to be the most exciting Halo game yet. With its open-world gameplay, stunning graphics, and intense action, Halo Infinite is sure to keep players on the edge of their seats. And one of the most important features of Halo Infinite is its wide array of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics and strengths.\nIn this article, we’ll take a closer look at every weapon in Halo Infinite, so you can be prepared to unleash the ultimate firepower when the game launches.\nAssault Rifle The Assault Rifle is the quintessential Halo weapon, and it’s back in Halo Infinite. This fully automatic rifle is deadly at close to medium ranges, and it has a 32-round magazine that can be expended quickly in the heat of battle. But the Assault Rifle is also incredibly accurate, making it a versatile weapon that can be used in a variety of situations.\nBattle Rifle If you prefer a more precise weapon, the Battle Rifle is your best bet. This semi-automatic rifle is capable of taking out enemy combatants with a single shot, but it requires a bit more skill to use effectively. The Battle Rifle has a 12-round magazine and is great for mid to long-range combat.\nDMR The DMR, or Designated Marksman Rifle, is similar to the Battle Rifle in that it’s a semi-automatic weapon, but it’s even more powerful. The DMR can take out targets with a single shot, but it has a slower rate of fire than the Battle Rifle. If you’re a skilled marksman, the DMR is the way to go.\nSniper Rifle The Sniper Rifle is an essential weapon for long-range combat. This powerful rifle can take out targets with a single shot, and it has a 4x zoom scope that allows you to pick off enemy combatants from afar. The Sniper Rifle is a high skill weapon that requires patience and precision, but it can be devastating in the right hands.\nRocket Launcher If you need to deal massive damage quickly, the Rocket Launcher is your weapon of choice. This heavy weapon fires a single rocket that can take out multiple enemy combatants at once. The Rocket Launcher is best used in open areas where you have plenty of room to maneuver and avoid enemy fire.\nEnergy Sword The Energy Sword is a melee weapon that is deadly in close combat. This glowing blade can slice through enemy combatants with ease, but it requires you to get up close and personal with your enemies. The Energy Sword also has a limited battery life, so it’s best used sparingly.\nPlasma Pistol The Plasma Pistol is a versatile weapon that can be used in a variety of situations. This energy weapon fires a bolt of plasma that can stun enemy combatants and disable their shields. The Plasma Pistol is also effective against vehicles, making it a great tool for taking out enemy aircraft or ground vehicles.\nPlasma Rifle The Plasma Rifle is a fully automatic energy weapon that fires a continuous beam of plasma. This weapon can quickly melt through enemy shields and armor, but it has a relatively short range. The Plasma Rifle is best used in close to medium-range combat.\nNeedler The Needler is a unique weapon that fires heat-seeking needles that stick to their targets before detonating. This weapon is excellent against enemy vehicles and can quickly take down aircraft. The Needler is also effective against infantry, but it requires a bit of skill to use effectively.\nConclusion And there you have it, every weapon in Halo Infinite! With such a wide variety of weapons to choose from, players are sure to have a blast experimenting with different loadouts and finding the weapons that work best for them. So get ready to unleash the ultimate firepower and have a blast playing Halo Infinite!\nWith the surprise launch announcement of the Halo Infinite beta during the Xbox 20th anniversary stream, it’s time to learn about the tools of destruction the game provides, its suite of weapons. And spoiler alert! There are a LOT of weapons in this game. Here’s all you need to know about the Halo Infinite Weapons List.\nHalo Infinite Weapons List Halo Infinite weapon list comprises tried and tested old classics and a myriad of new, never seen before guns divided within the factions that are UNSC, Banished and Forerunner. Let’s start with the ones we know and are accustomed to and slowly make our way into the uncharted territories. So, here goes the list of Halo Infinite weapons in alphabetical order.\nAssault Rifle “This is my rifle, this is my gun.” If there has ever been an IP defining weapon in the history of video games, it is the halo assault rifle. Just a quick peek at this weapon will flash you with visions of it’s history, importance, significance and all the memories you \u0026 I have made throughout the past 20 years of this legendary franchise. Just like the game mode itself, this gun is a slayer.\nBattle Rifle Ah, another classic. The halo BR is one of the most renowned and adored weapons amongst the Halo community. Not only does its 3 shot burst shred your foes so fast that they are left with their head scratching as to what hit them. This is one of the most good-feeling and satisfactory weapons to use and it has made its magnificent returning Infinite.\nBulldog Shotgun Halo games always had a good shotgun that felt good to fire and always packed a punch. The Bulldog here takes the Shotgun game on another level with its tight package spread, fast rate of fire, quick reload speed and a pile of dead Spartans behind its wielder.\nCindershot An interesting new addition to the Halos arsenal of weapons. With two firing modes, this Grenade Launcher fires projectiles that bounce around walls and corners before exploding and in the second mode fires a micro missile that itself bounces before exploding. A unique weapon with a learning curve, this GL is great for choke points and can blindside your enemies pretty easily.\nCommando Remember the DMR? Sadly, that’s not back the same way it used to be but the Commando right here is pretty much it’s successor. A full auto, long-range, scoped rifle(where have I heard that before?), the Commando here can take care of the competition at range or even in close proximity, and based on how fast this gun fires? Oh boy, Red team doesn’t stand a chance!\nDisruptor Since when did the Banished start liking small guns? The Disruptor is a rapid-firing pistol that fires electricity bolts and can disable vehicles because the bolts act as EMP. Not much to say about this one as it doesn’t do much damage to Spartans but is an excellent choice to pin vehicles in place.\nEnergy Sword For me Halo is incomplete without the energy sword as I personally LOVE to charge towards other players while wielding this blue, shiny boy. Word of advice, If you ever see someone running towards you with this sword in their hands, you’re dead. Melee weapons are fun and easy to use and with this sword in your hands. you’ll look ten times cooler slaying the battlefield.\nGravity Hammer Another melee weapon and another powerhouse. This hammer scares me, every time I see someone else with it. It’s powerful, absurd and menacing. If the Energy Sword makes you look cooler than the Gravity Hammer makes you look all the more scarier. It’s back, it’s here and it still acts as the one way ticket to sending your enemies into space.\nHeatwave The Scattershot Shotgun from Halo 4\u00265 makes its return with a different look and more potent functionality. Just like those games, the projectiles fired from this gun ricochet all over place, this time for much longer. It also comes with 2 firing modes, one being horizontal and the other vertical which acts much more like a traditional shotgun. Learn and master this weapon and then watch enemy Spartans crumble in close range.\nHydra A rocket launcher that is a grenade launcher? What? Yeah, that’s probably the best way to describe the Hydra which was first introduced in Halo 5 Guardians. It’s pretty much the same as what it was in Halo 5 except this one comes with one major upgrade. The normal fire mode releases a barrage of small rockets that if fired in the general direction of your foe will wreck them on the other hand the lock on mode is a much slower process but will track and chase your foe. A good weapon overall with much more added functionality for sure.\nMangler The Mauler Shotgun Pistol 2.0. This is a precision weapon that fires slugs and can do high damage to the head. The two tusks looking things on its front aren’t for show either and are used in its melee animation. It’s a new weapon which isn’t completely new as it retains a bit of the look and feel of those Halo 3 days.\nNeedler Who doesn’t remember this little rascal? A close-range SMG of sorts with its prickly needles popping outwards that slowly get pushed down and disintegrate as you fire them. This fires fast, tracks your enemies and then the payload explodes dealing great damage. But the Needler gets bonus points from my end for still being one of the coolest-looking weapons ever.\nPlasma Pistol The noob combo. A phrase synonymous with the Plasma Pistol. Although it doesn’t EMP vehicles anymore this pistol still charge shots like a champ and then with one single punch the enemy Spartan will be lying on the ground. An old friend and a fan favorite, it’s good to see this little monster returning for Halo Infinite.\nPulse Carbine The Plasma Rifle and The Covenant Carbine have merged into one in this new Pulse Carbine. Just like the old Covenant weapons you have to manage the heat on this 5 burst firing auto rifle of sorts. Its a great option for mid range, it fires slow and has a bit of tracking and is frankly a complete package of a weapon.\nRocket Launcher Boom goes the rocket, pop goes the weasel. This is a scientific fact! Trust me! This iconic rocket launcher still retains its two barrels and anything that is struck directly with its missile or is unlucky enough to stand in close proximity of the blast will be wiped off from the face of the Earth. Or the face of the Halo in this case. If you have any knowledge of Halo whatsoever, you know this weapon and you know that it needs no explaining.\nSentinel Beam It’s back! It looks different, sounds different and functions differently than it used to before and it is also missing battery and overheat mechanic. But what it has now is crazy Hugh damage that comes from the ammo you get. Yes, it has hella recoil this time around but my god does it deal a whole heck of a lot of damage!\nShock Rifle A heavy Sniper Rifle that fires bolts of electricity. Although it lacks a proper zoom scope, this Rifle is still a viable long range weapon and can very much one shot a Spartan with a direct hit to the head. The shock even spreads across multiple Spartans if they are standing in close proximity and can do a decent bit of shock damage to all of them. An interesting addition to say the least.\nSidekick The one shot Magnum, this pistol is not. A fast firing, high precision damage dealing secondary weapon if you want? This gun delivers. Granted you’ll be busy using the big boy guns on the battlefield, kindly don’t sleep on this one as it very well is quite a respectable piece of weaponry in your kit.\nSkewer I don’t know in which archetype I can fit this one. A new weapon in Halo Infinite the Skewer looks like a Rocket Launcher, functions like a Sniper Rifle and fires Javelins that kill anything in the way. Yikes. It pretty much one shots anything, be it Spartans or vehicles alike and yes it’s very very scary. I’d steer clear from its way if I were you.\nSniper Rifle Another classic returns in its full glory. I’ll be honest with you, I am not a sniper rifle guy myself but do I have memories of getting mapped by this gun from across the map throughout all the Halo games. It’s a sniper rifle. Check. It hits harder than a truck. Check. And it’s a community favorite. Check! Whenever you use this gun just remember what Thanos said and go for the head!\nStalker Rifle A long range covenant DMR, so basically the Covenant Carbine right? Yes and no both. The Stalker Rifle is part DMR part Sniper Rifle because of its range capabilities and high damage. The one caveat it comes with is its slow reload time, since it’s a Covenant/Banished weapon it vents out heat to reload and that can take a minute once you unload its seven shots. Good choice of weapon for high damage at range that’s for sure.\nRavager You must have seen this blocky looking red plasma based weapon in the trailers. Doesn’t matter if the answer is a yes or a no, this new plasma grenade launcher thingy is not to be trifled with. It fires 3 round bursts that will destroy enemy Spartans in a single burst if hit directly and then it also has a charged shot which leaves a flaming pool on the ground, once exploded. Yup, powerhouse is what this gun is.\nThese have been all the known, new and old weapons that Halo Infinite has to offer so far. Whenever there’ll be new additions, tweaks, changes or anything else that happens throughout the life cycles of Halo Infinite you can bet we’ll have it covered here at GamerTweak.\nAnd if you are

Not only does its 3 shot burst shred your foes so fast that they are left with their head scratching as to what hit them. This is one of the most good-feeling and satisfactory weapons to use and it has made its magnificent returning Infinite.</p><h3 id=bulldog-shotgun>Bulldog Shotgun<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bulldog-shotgun>#</a></h3><p>Halo games always had a good shotgun that felt good to fire and always packed a punch. The Bulldog here takes the Shotgun game on another level with its tight package spread, fast rate of fire, quick reload speed and a pile of dead Spartans behind its wielder.</p><h3 id=cindershot>Cindershot<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cindershot>#</a></h3><p>An interesting new addition to the Halos arsenal of weapons. With two firing modes, this Grenade Launcher fires projectiles that bounce around walls and corners before exploding and in the second mode fires a micro missile that itself bounces before exploding. A unique weapon with a learning curve, this GL is great for choke points and can blindside your enemies pretty easily.</p><h3 id=commando>Commando<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#commando>#</a></h3><p>Remember the DMR? Sadly, that’s not back the same way it used to be but the Commando right here is pretty much it’s successor. A full auto, long-range, scoped rifle(where have I heard that before?), the Commando here can take care of the competition at range or even in close proximity, and based on how fast this gun fires? Oh boy, Red team doesn’t stand a chance!</p><h3 id=disruptor>Disruptor<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#disruptor>#</a></h3><p>Since when did the Banished start liking small guns? The Disruptor is a rapid-firing pistol that fires electricity bolts and can disable vehicles because the bolts act as EMP. Not much to say about this one as it doesn’t do much damage to Spartans but is an excellent choice to pin vehicles in place.</p><h3 id=energy-sword-1>Energy Sword<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#energy-sword-1>#</a></h3><p>For me Halo is incomplete without the energy sword as I personally LOVE to charge towards other players while wielding this blue, shiny boy. Word of advice, If you ever see someone running towards you with this sword in their hands, you’re dead. Melee weapons are fun and easy to use and with this sword in your hands. you’ll look ten times cooler slaying the battlefield.</p><h3 id=gravity-hammer>Gravity Hammer<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gravity-hammer>#</a></h3><p>Another melee weapon and another powerhouse. This hammer scares me, every time I see someone else with it. It’s powerful, absurd and menacing. If the Energy Sword makes you look cooler than the Gravity Hammer makes you look all the more scarier. It’s back, it’s here and it still acts as the one way ticket to sending your enemies into space.</p><h3 id=heatwave>Heatwave<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#heatwave>#</a></h3><p>The Scattershot Shotgun from Halo 4&5 makes its return with a different look and more potent functionality. Just like those games, the projectiles fired from this gun ricochet all over place, this time for much longer. It also comes with 2 firing modes, one being horizontal and the other vertical which acts much more like a traditional shotgun. Learn and master this weapon and then watch enemy Spartans crumble in close range.</p><h3 id=hydra>Hydra<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hydra>#</a></h3><p>A rocket launcher that is a grenade launcher? What? Yeah, that’s probably the best way to describe the Hydra which was first introduced in Halo 5 Guardians. It’s pretty much the same as what it was in Halo 5 except this one comes with one major upgrade. The normal fire mode releases a barrage of small rockets that if fired in the general direction of your foe will wreck them on the other hand the lock on mode is a much slower process but will track and chase your foe. A good weapon overall with much more added functionality for sure.</p><h3 id=mangler>Mangler<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#mangler>#</a></h3><p>The Mauler Shotgun Pistol 2.0. This is a precision weapon that fires slugs and can do high damage to the head. The two tusks looking things on its front aren’t for show either and are used in its melee animation. It’s a new weapon which isn’t completely new as it retains a bit of the look and feel of those Halo 3 days.</p><h3 id=needler-1>Needler<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#needler-1>#</a></h3><p>Who doesn’t remember this little rascal? A close-range SMG of sorts with its prickly needles popping outwards that slowly get pushed down and disintegrate as you fire them. This fires fast, tracks your enemies and then the payload explodes dealing great damage. But the Needler gets bonus points from my end for still being one of the coolest-looking weapons ever.</p><h3 id=plasma-pistol-1>Plasma Pistol<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#plasma-pistol-1>#</a></h3><p>The noob combo. A phrase synonymous with the Plasma Pistol. Although it doesn’t EMP vehicles anymore this pistol still charge shots like a champ and then with one single punch the enemy Spartan will be lying on the ground. An old friend and a fan favorite, it’s good to see this little monster returning for Halo Infinite.</p><h3 id=pulse-carbine>Pulse Carbine<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pulse-carbine>#</a></h3><p>The Plasma Rifle and The Covenant Carbine have merged into one in this new Pulse Carbine. Just like the old Covenant weapons you have to manage the heat on this 5 burst firing auto rifle of sorts. Its a great option for mid range, it fires slow and has a bit of tracking and is frankly a complete package of a weapon.</p><h3 id=rocket-launcher-1>Rocket Launcher<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#rocket-launcher-1>#</a></h3><p>Boom goes the rocket, pop goes the weasel. This is a scientific fact! Trust me! This iconic rocket launcher still retains its two barrels and anything that is struck directly with its missile or is unlucky enough to stand in close proximity of the blast will be wiped off from the face of the Earth. Or the face of the Halo in this case. If you have any knowledge of Halo whatsoever, you know this weapon and you know that it needs no explaining.</p><h3 id=sentinel-beam>Sentinel Beam<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sentinel-beam>#</a></h3><p>It’s back! It looks different, sounds different and functions differently than it used to before and it is also missing battery and overheat mechanic. But what it has now is crazy Hugh damage that comes from the ammo you get. Yes, it has hella recoil this time around but my god does it deal a whole heck of a lot of damage!</p><h3 id=shock-rifle>Shock Rifle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#shock-rifle>#</a></h3><p>A heavy Sniper Rifle that fires bolts of electricity. Although it lacks a proper zoom scope, this Rifle is still a viable long range weapon and can very much one shot a Spartan with a direct hit to the head. The shock even spreads across multiple Spartans if they are standing in close proximity and can do a decent bit of shock damage to all of them. An interesting addition to say the least.</p><h3 id=sidekick>Sidekick<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sidekick>#</a></h3><p>The one shot Magnum, this pistol is not. A fast firing, high precision damage dealing secondary weapon if you want? This gun delivers. Granted you’ll be busy using the big boy guns on the battlefield, kindly don’t sleep on this one as it very well is quite a respectable piece of weaponry in your kit.</p><h3 id=skewer>Skewer<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#skewer>#</a></h3><p>I don’t know in which archetype I can fit this one. A new weapon in Halo Infinite the Skewer looks like a Rocket Launcher, functions like a Sniper Rifle and fires Javelins that kill anything in the way. Yikes. It pretty much one shots anything, be it Spartans or vehicles alike and yes it’s very very scary. I’d steer clear from its way if I were you.</p><h3 id=sniper-rifle-1>Sniper Rifle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sniper-rifle-1>#</a></h3><p>Another classic returns in its full glory. I’ll be honest with you, I am not a sniper rifle guy myself but do I have memories of getting mapped by this gun from across the map throughout all the Halo games. It’s a sniper rifle. Check. It hits harder than a truck. Check. And it’s a community favorite. Check! Whenever you use this gun just remember what Thanos said and go for the head!</p><h3 id=stalker-rifle>Stalker Rifle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#stalker-rifle>#</a></h3><p>A long range covenant DMR, so basically the Covenant Carbine right? Yes and no both. The Stalker Rifle is part DMR part Sniper Rifle because of its range capabilities and high damage. The one caveat it comes with is its slow reload time, since it’s a Covenant/Banished weapon it vents out heat to reload and that can take a minute once you unload its seven shots. Good choice of weapon for high damage at range that’s for sure.</p><h3 id=ravager>Ravager<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ravager>#</a></h3><p>You must have seen this blocky looking red plasma based weapon in the trailers. Doesn’t matter if the answer is a yes or a no, this new plasma grenade launcher thingy is not to be trifled with. It fires 3 round bursts that will destroy enemy Spartans in a single burst if hit directly and then it also has a charged shot which leaves a flaming pool on the ground, once exploded. Yup, powerhouse is what this gun is.</p><p>These have been all the known, new and old weapons that Halo Infinite has to offer so far.
