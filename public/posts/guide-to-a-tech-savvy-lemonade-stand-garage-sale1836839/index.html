Well, for 8-year-old Matthew Johnson, it’s not just about quenching your thirst. He has turned his humble lemonade stand into a high-tech cash machine, and the story behind it is nothing short of inspiring.\nMain body: Matthew first started his lemonade stand in front of his house, hoping to earn some pocket money. He would mix some lemons, sugar, and water, set up a table, and wait for customers. Although he made decent money, he noticed that most people would walk by without stopping. That’s when Matthew decided to level up.\nHe asked his tech-savvy grandfather for help and together they came up with a plan. They installed a small touchscreen kiosk with a custom-made point-of-sale (POS) software, a barcode scanner, and a credit card reader. They also created a website where customers could pre-order and choose from a variety of flavors and add-ons such as ice cubes, mint leaves, and fruit skewers.\nThe results were staggering. Matthew’s sales skyrocketed, and his customer satisfaction rate went through the roof. Not only could people order their drinks faster and more conveniently, but they also liked the modern and professional look of the kiosk. Mattew’s business had become a hot spot in town, and people started coming not just for the lemonade but for the experience.\nBut Matthew didn’t stop there. He wanted to give back to the community and promote environmental sustainability. He partnered with a local charity to donate a portion of his profits to plant trees and reduce carbon emissions. He also switched to biodegradable cups and straws, and encouraged customers to bring their own reusable containers.\nConclusion: Matthew’s lemonade stand is more than just a business. It’s a testament to the power of innovation, collaboration, and a strong sense of purpose. Matthew shows that even at a young age, one can make a difference and make the world a better place. He inspires us to think beyond the ordinary and take action to make our dreams a reality. So, the next time you see a lemonade stand, remember: it’s not just a drink, it’s a story waiting to be told.\nWhen you look back to your childhood, several things may come to mind. One of those fun events may be the classic lemonade stand in your neighborhood. The customer makes their order, you make the lemonade, and the customer gives you the money. However, in today’s modern age, the lemonade stand doesn’t have to be as simple as that. Even looking past lemonade stands, everything from garage sales to selling some of your belongings to friends can be shaped by new applications and gadgets. Today, we will take a look at five applications that brings the nostalgic lemonade/garage sales to the 21st century.\n1. Mint for iOS Mint is an application that allows you to manage your money, budget, and more. All you have to do is add your credit card and bank account information, from there you will see where your money is being allocated and where you can begin to save on. This is done very easily, without you having to manually enter each transaction. This is great for allocating a budget for your garage sale or stand, allowing you to set how much you will spend on supplies like cups, boxes, and signs. Everything is safe and even password protected, preventing prying eyes from seeing your financial information. Plus, everything is available on the Internet, preventing you from having to have your phone near when checking on your account. Mint.com is available for free.\n2. Microsoft Office for Mac You may be confused as to why an office suite is on this list. You may be surprised to learn that Microsoft Office comes with the ability to make nice, vibrant signs and posters for free. In Microsoft Office, when you click on Microsoft Project Gallery, just click events or flyers and you are presented with many choices for advertising your sale. They are templates that allow you to customize the text and photos, allowing you to make your posters to be a bit more personalized. Microsoft Office for Mac comes with Microsoft Word, the word processing application, Microsoft Excel, allowing you to make spreadsheets, Microsoft PowerPoint, allowing you to make presentations, and Microsoft Entourage, the emailing client.\n3. Square for iOS Square for iOS is almost an essential application for anyone looking to sell during a garage sale or lemonade stand. Square allows you to accept credit cards while on the run, instead of having to depend on money. Square is simple. All you have to do is to enter the totals and information, swipe the card, and everything is charged and sent to your bank account. Square is very easy to set up and works by having a receiver inserted into your iOS device’s headphone jack. All you have to do is pay a very small fee. Square allows you to keep also keep track of all of the money you receive. You can also send receipts to your customers to their phones and emails. Square is free to sign up, and is available in the App Store.\n4. Facebook for iOS It may seem like an unlikely choice at first to have Facebook as one of your essential applications for your next garage sale and lemonade stand; however, it’s actually an application to look to for promoting your next sale. Through Facebook Events, you are able to promote the sale, have a set time, view the individuals expected to stop by and more. You can use the photos feature to allow the expected visitors to view what you are selling at the garage sale. The directions feature allows you to add the location and even have a map. The Facebook integration allows you to also answer any questions that some of the customers present to you through messages. Facebook for iOS is a free application you should look into for your next sale.\n5. eBay/Craigslist for iOS If you are looking for a completely virtual garage sale, then eBay or Craigslist may be the best application for you. While it can be a bit time consuming to post each item individually on the site, you are expected to get more in the end. While eBay does have a special allowing you to post on the site for free, you aren’t sure how long it will last. Despite this, eBay and Craigslist, in the end, will give you the best return. In addition, you are able to open your products to a wider audience. Both the Craigslist and eBay applications allow you to both view and post onto the website. You can monitor how your item is doing on the eBay application, and also correspond with interested buyers on both applications. Both are free and something you should check out today.\nImage credit: Real Garage Sale Sign by BigStockPhoto\nAri Simon has been a writer with Make Tech Easier since August 2011.
