While it offers a wealth of built-in tools and features, there are still many hidden gems that most people never discover. One of these hidden gems is the ability to mount a drive as a folder, which can be a game-changer for anyone looking to improve their productivity and streamline their workflow.\nMounting a drive as a folder essentially means that you can access the contents of the drive as if it were just another folder on your computer. This can be incredibly useful if you work with a lot of files or frequently access files on an external drive or networked drive. Instead of having to navigate to the drive every time you want to access it, you can simply access it as if it were a part of your local file system.\nSo, how do you mount a drive as a folder? Fortunately, the process is relatively straightforward and can be done in just a few simple steps. Here’s how:\nStep 1: Open Windows Explorer\nTo begin, you’ll need to open Windows Explorer (also known as File Explorer). You can do this by clicking on the Windows icon in the bottom left-hand corner of your screen and then selecting “File Explorer” from the menu.\nStep 2: Select “Computer” from the left-hand menu\nOnce you’ve opened Windows Explorer, you’ll see a menu on the left-hand side of the screen that includes options such as “Quick Access,” “This PC,” and “Network.” Select “Computer” from this menu.\nStep 3: Click on “Map network drive”\nAt the top of the window, you should now see a toolbar that includes a variety of options. Click on the option that says “Map network drive.”\nStep 4: Choose the drive you want to mount\nIn the dialog box that appears, you’ll be asked to choose the drive you want to mount. This can be a local drive, an external drive, or a networked drive.\nStep 5: Choose the option to “Connect using different credentials”\nIf you’re mounting a networked drive, you may be prompted to enter your login credentials. If so, choose the option to “Connect using different credentials” and enter your login information.\nStep 6: Choose the drive letter you want to use\nNext, you’ll be asked to choose the drive letter you want to use. This is the letter that will be used to access the drive as a folder.\nStep 7: Choose the option to “Reconnect at sign-in”\nFinally, check the box that says “Reconnect at sign-in” if you want the drive to be mounted automatically every time you log in to your computer.\nThat’s it! Once you’ve completed these steps, the drive will be mounted as a folder and you can access it just like any other folder on your computer.\nIn conclusion, learning how to mount a drive as a folder is a simple but powerful trick that can help you to work more efficiently and effectively. By following the steps outlined above, you can take full advantage of this hidden gem in Windows 7 and unleash the full potential of your computer.\nMounting a drive to a folder path can have its benefits and inconveniences. For example, if you’re already sharing content in your network, you probably have one or several network map drives. The problem is that as you add more drives to the network, you start adding more map points to the computer. This can quickly add-up and they can start getting you confuse (Music in drive M, Movie on X, Pictures on P, Documents on D, and so on), and it’s hard to keep-up.\nHaving a single drive with mount points to other drives can make it easier to host your content. The steps below will show you the process to mount a drive to an empty folder in Windows 7 using the Command Prompt and Computer Management.\nHow to mount a drive as a folder using Command Prompt How to mount a drive as a folder using Computer Management How to mount a drive as a folder using Command Prompt Open File Explorer.

Click the Add button. Select the Mount in the following empty NTFS folder option. Click the Browse button. Locate the empty folder you have created to work as mount point, and click OK.
