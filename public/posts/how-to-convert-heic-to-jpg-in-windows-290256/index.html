If you hit a brick wall viewing HEIC files on Windows, try some of these ways to convert HEIC to JPG.\nOpening HEIC In Windows High Efficiency Image File Format (saved as HEIC) is a specific file format that is proprietary to iOS devices. Your Windows device can open these files – you just need to download the correct extension package first.\nAs long as you have Windows 10 or Windows 11, you have the option of simply opening HEIC files on your computer without converting them to JPEG.

However, you can use many of the above-mentioned methods to convert your HEIC files to JPEG so that you can open or edit them in Windows.\nAre there any disadvantages to converting my HEIC files to JPG? HEIC files are, in general, higher quality and require less storage space. Therefore, the largest disadvantage to converting them is the loss in quality.\nDo I need to convert JPG files to HEIC to open them on my iPhone?

Right-click on it and select “Convert to JPEG with CopyTrans.”</li></ul><h2 id=8-imobie-heic-converter>8. iMobie HEIC Converter<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#8-imobie-heic-converter>#</a></h2><p>iMobie HEIC converter is another platform that allows you to convert HEIC files to JPG in Windows. It is available for free online or as a desktop app. Just upload the HEIC file to the platform, and it will convert it to JPG, then re-download it in the new format.</p><p>It retains the quality of the image file even after conversion. The online platform as well as the desktop app are easy to use, and you can get your conversions done in a matter of seconds.</p><h2 id=9-gimp>9.

CloudConvert<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#10-cloudconvert>#</a></h2><p>Depending on the situation, you may want a tool that allows you to convert multiple file types, not just HEIC files.
