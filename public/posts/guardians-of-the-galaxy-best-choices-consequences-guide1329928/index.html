Your Step-by-Step Guide to Making the Best Decisions in Guardians of the Galaxy\nThe Marvel cinematic universe is a vast and exciting place filled with superheroes, villains, and everything in between. One of the most beloved and unconventional groups of heroes in this universe is the Guardians of the Galaxy. Made up of a motley crew of characters from different worlds and walks of life, the Guardians embark on thrilling adventures across the cosmos.\nAs a player of the Guardians of the Galaxy video game, you take on the role of Peter Quill, also known as Star-Lord, as he leads the team on their latest mission. One of the key elements of the game is decision-making, as the choices you make will determine the outcome of the story. In this guide, we’ll show you how to make the best decisions in the game and unleash the ultimate power of the Guardians.\nStep 1: Understand Your Characters\nBefore making any decisions in the game, it’s crucial to understand your characters and their motivations. Each member of the Guardians has their own unique personality and backstory, and this will influence the choices they make. It’s important to pay attention to how they respond to different situations and the consequences of those actions. Understanding your characters will help you make decisions that are in line with their personalities and goals.\nStep 2: Consider the Consequences\nEvery decision you make in the game will have consequences, some more significant than others. When faced with a choice, take the time to consider what the outcome might be. Will your decision lead to a positive outcome for your team, or will it create more problems? Will it affect your relationships with other characters? Will it impact the overall story and ending of the game? By considering the consequences of your decisions, you can make choices that will benefit your team and help you achieve your goals.\nStep 3: Communicate With Your Team\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy are a team, and communication is key to their success. When making decisions, it’s important to consider the opinions and input of your team members. Talking to them and understanding their perspectives can help you make the best decisions for the group. Additionally, building strong relationships with your team members can unlock special abilities and dialogue options that can aid you in your mission.\nStep 4: Trust Your Gut\nSometimes, the best decisions are the ones that come from the heart. In the game, you’ll be faced with tough choices that don’t always have a clear right or wrong answer. When this happens, trust your instincts and make the decision that feels right to you. Don’t be afraid to take risks or go against the norm if it means protecting your team and achieving your goals.\nStep 5: Own Your Choices\nOnce you’ve made a decision, own it. Accept the consequences of your actions and move forward with confidence. Don’t second-guess yourself or dwell on what could have been. Remember that every decision you make is an opportunity for growth and learning, and it will ultimately shape the outcome of the game.\nIn conclusion, making the best decisions in Guardians of the Galaxy requires understanding your characters, considering the consequences, communicating with your team, trusting your gut, and owning your choices. By following these steps, you’ll be able to unleash the ultimate power of the Guardians and lead your team to victory. Happy gaming!\nWhen playing Guardians of the Galaxy, you will often come across opportunities to make choices that have different consequences. The choices you make are entirely dependent upon you. However, it is important to know and understand the effects each decision will have on your performance and progress in the game. If you are wondering what the best choices and consequences are in this game, we’ve got you covered. In this guide, we will show you all of the possible choices in all the chapters, and the consequences of each of them.\nGuardians Of The Galaxy Best Choices \u0026 Consequences Guide Table of Contents\nChapter One Choices \u0026 Consequences in Guardians of the Galaxy There are no important choices and consequences in this chapter of Guardians of the Galaxy. You will only find a few dialogue choices that do not have a lot of consequences.\nChapter Two Choices \u0026 Consequences in Guardians of the Galaxy Double Down or Lie When you face this particular choice in Guardians of the Galaxy, you can choose between either Double Down or Lie.\nIf you choose Double Down, you will see Star Lord discussing his past with the captain of the other ship. During this conversation, he will promise that he does not intend on smuggling anything. Drax will enter the cockpit with a box of illegal tech items. This will result in the captain not paying heed to any of your pleas.\nIf you choose Lie, you will simply lie and tell the captain that your navigation malfunctioned. Drax will now arrive with a box of illegal goods. Following this, you will be threatened with arrest.\nHide the Creature or Hide the Tech If you pick Hide the Creature, Star Lord will ask Drax to hide the Llama. This will disappoint Rocket, as he wants the technology. To justify his actions, Star Lord will explain that he has had relations in the past with the captain of the other ship. Because of this, he believes that he can convince the captain to allow them to keep the tech. The Star Lord, however, does not feel like the captain will avoid the potential of a biohazard. This means that if you go ahead with this decision, you will receive a fine of 7000 units for smuggling tech that is illegal. The Llama, however, will be with you throughout the entirety of the journey. You will also be able to pet it during certain points of the storyline.\nIf you choose to Hide the Tech, you will displease Gomora. Despite this, she will trust you when you tell her that you will be able to talk your way out of the mess. A little while later, you will see a boarding party arriving. You will receive a fine of 8000 units. Further in the game, you will receive lock-on rockets for your ship whenever you battle in space.\nBack Pedal or Stick Up For Nikki If you choose the Back Pedal option, you will quite literally backpedal and then say that Nikki has a conviction. She will not be happy with this action. However, regardless of whatever happens, both of you will be going up in the elevator.\nIf you choose Stick Up For Nikki, Star Lord will tell her mother that she took care of herself quite well and that her mother should be proud. However, Nikki’s mother will continue to remain upset at her daughter. She will then proceed to lock down the elevator.\nMake A Joke, Back-Up Ko-Rel, Reaactivate Elevator Of these different choices in Guardians of the Galaxy, if you choose to Make a Joke, Star Lord will make a joke about getting stuck inside an elevator. However, Nikki and her mother will not be very appreciative of the joke and will make their displeasure known. They will then continue to argue among themselves. This choice will gradually result in Nikki giving you her passkey as she now trusts you. Because of this, you will be able to enter her room as the story progresses.\nIf you decide to Back Up Ko-Rel, you will tell Nikki how you feel her mother is on to her. Ko-Rel will not allow anybody to leave the elevator until somebody gives her answers. Nikki, however, will end up losing her key because of her vague attempts to lie and say she can fit through things easier because of her small size.\nIf you pick Reactivate Elevator, you will fail in trying to stop the lockdown. Both Nikki, as well as her mother, will be express their frustration with you. Nikki will also express hesitation at trusting you.\nSide with Ko-Rel or Try to Help Nikki Deciding to side with Ko-Rel will result in Star Lord advising Nikki to tell her mother all she needs to know. Star Lord will express his amazement at Nikki’s young age of just 12. Nikki will eventually trust you and hand over her passkey.\nIf you decide to try to help Nikki, you will tell Nikki about the glitch which is present across all the systems. Nikki will mention the security being down, after which you will agree with her. After this, Ko-Rel will order Nikki to clear her pockets. However, Ko-Rel will be met with a stern no from Nikki.\nTell Ko-Rel the Truth, Divert Attention, Take The Blame Choosing to tell Ko-Rel the truth about Nikki having a passkey will result in Nikki getting upset with you and giving up her passkey.\nPicking the option to Divert Attention will result in you telling Ko-Rel that you still harbor feelings for her. This will result in both, Nikki as well as Ko-Rel getting surprised. Nikki will also begin to doubt her ability to trust you, and you will find out that Nikki created the key herself. Despite this, she will still lose the key.\nDo The Math or Ignore The Math If you choose to do the math, you will come to the realization that Nikki is quite likely your daughter. Ko-Rel will offer to pay off your fine over a period of three cycles. You will have to pay an amount of either 7 or 8000 units for smuggling, and this depends on your earlier choices.\nHowever, if you decide to ignore the math, Star Lord will offer his toy chewie the choice to either stay or come back to him. Star Lord will play with the Wookie, even mimicking the voice of a Wookie when doing so. The chewie will then realize that he is alright and choose to stay back with Ko-Rel.\nChapter 3 Choices \u0026 Consequences in Guardians of the Galaxy Hear Out Drax, Call on Groot, Focus on Rocket If you decide to hear Drax out, Star Lord will explain to the team that Fing Fang Foom is a monster with a great legacy. It is feared right across the entirety of the galaxy. He will also explain that such a death would be a glorious one, however, the team will counter this statement, claiming that death is not the objective. Rocket will then claim that the best choice is to sell Gamura’s figures. Groot will gather the team together and suggest that everybody needs to combine each other’s ideas.\nIf you decide to Call on Groot, you will hear him out. Rocket will also listen to Groot and help translate his message. Groot will suggest that all the ideas need to be combined together.\nIf you choose to Focus on Rocket, you will lean more towards Rocket’s idea of selling Gamura’s figures. Rocket will back this up by suggesting that her collection will attract plenty of buyers who will not mind paying high prices.\nVote to Sell Groot or Rocket If you decide to sell Groot, Star Lord will thank him for volunteering to be sold. He will explain how Groot is a more convincing choice. Along with this, he also promises to help rescue Groot as soon as the transaction has been completed. You will be offered the opportunity to change your mind later, however, this will not make that big of a difference. All it will do is change a few cutscenes and the mission with Lady Hellbender.\nNow, if you decide to Vote to Sell Rocket, you will tell him that he is fearsome on the inside.\nEncourage Drax or Stop Drax Choosing to encourage Drax will quite literally result in you encouraging him, infuriating Rocket in the process. To pacify him, you will then tell him that you will offer him a rise of 10% to his cut. The next time you make the suggestion to toss Rocket, he will get angry again.\nIf you decide to stop Drax, Star Lord will end up informing Drax about his intentions to not throw Rocket. Instead, he will decide to find another way.\nStand your Ground or Change your Mind If you choose the former, Star Lord will inform Drax of his plans to get Groot into the cage. The only major differences here will be in the form of cutscenes, so there’s not much to worry about.\nIf you choose to Change your Mind, you will be able to switch Groot and sell Rocket. This will anger Gamora because of the fact that you had voted on it. However, Rocket will be more than pleased to get inside the cage.\nDeflect, Qualify, Rationalize, Compromise, Reassure, or Argue Choosing deflect will result in you telling your mother that she used to watch scary movies during her youth. However, she will refuse to budge.\nQualify Choosing to go with Qualify will result in you having to find another way to convince your mother, as she will not budge.\nRationalize As the name suggests, you will try to appeal to your mother through rational means. However, despite this, she will need a little more convincing.\nCompromise Choosing this option will result in you telling your mother that you can still do some of the same things. You will push her a little more, but she will still not budge.\nReassure Choosing reassurance will result in mom finally handing over the cash because you manage to convince her about it not being a very big deal.\nArgue Your mother finally hands over the cash once you tell her how you are not such a little kid anymore.\nChapter 4 Side With Rocket or Gamora This choice will result in Rocket claiming that agreeing with him is the smart thing to do as a consequence in Guardians of the Galaxy (GOTG). He will also poke some fun at Gamora.\nSide With Gamora Star Lord will claim that Gamora is a trustworthy person and that he trusts her with his own life.\nTake The Lead Or Encourage Drax Choosing to Take the Lead will result in you quite literally taking the lead. You will introduce yourself to the queen, despite the fact that she does not know who you are. You will then go on to ask Drax to show the queen the monster. However, Drax will express confusion at this request.\nEncourage Drax Encouraging Drax will result in him agreeing because of the fact that you are not great at negotiation. He will then proceed to speak with the woman and tell her that she needs to be well-versed with the specific weapon. The queen will also offer to give Drax a demonstration. Depending on your earlier choice, you will either show the queen Rocket or Groot.\nEncourage Cuteness or Push Rocket If you choose to encourage cuteness, you will convince the queen about Rocket’s cuteness when he drinks from a saucer. The queen will enjoy this, and even express her appreciation at his attitude. Quite weirdly, though, this appreciation will trigger Rocket into shooting at everyone.\nIf you choose to push ferociousness, you will need to convince the queen that Rocket is genuinely strong. You will have to convince her that Rocket can actually be a potent killing machine.\nGroot Price Negotiation (Offer Less/Support Drax) If you offer less, Star Lord will counter you with an offer for 10,000 units. While Gamora and Star Lord will agree about 10,000 units being perfect, Drax will still stand by his request of 20,000 units. Eventually, he will settle for an amount of 9,537 units, and Groot will be taken away.\nIf you choose to support Drax’s request for 20,000 units, Lady Hellbender will offer 15,000 units, with the condition that Drax needs to stay. Countering this, Drax will explain his other commitments, and Hellbender will finally agree on a price of 12,000 units.\nPrice Negotiation for Rocket (Stick with Offer/Offer Less) If you choose to stick with the original offer, you will have the opportunity to agree to Rocket’s suggestion of 20,000 units. You will try to lie to him by mentioning the fact that you have another potential dealer. However, Rocket will call your bluff, and now you will need to shoot your way out.\nIf you choose to offer less, you will infuriate Rocket, who will start to shoot up the place.\nChapter 5 Choices \u0026 Consequences in Guardians of the Galaxy Ask about Crime or Ask about Nova Corps If you choose the ask about crime option, Star Lord will ask the criminal about the crime, however, there will be no response from the criminal.\nIf you ask about the Nova Corps, the criminal will deny knowing a lot.

You will be witness to the executions of Nova Corps members as you leave.\nIf you decide to speak into the helmet, you will hear voices through the helmet. However, these voices will not sound like those of Nova Corps. The voices will offer help when you tell them you are in search of the centurion. The voices say they will come to you when you tell them where you are.\nYou will then have the ability to choose if you want to retreat or stall and defend yourself.\nChapter 6 Defer to Gamora, Tell The Truth, Pretend You Remember, Freeze and Say Nothing If you decide to defer to Gamora, she will tell you how both of you fought together.\nIf you decide to tell the truth, Star Lord claims that he has no memory of a previous encounter, before apologizing. He will sing upon becoming upset at Star Lord.\nIf you pretend that you remember, he will laugh and sing upon being relieved.\nIf you freeze, Rocket will get upset. He will then begin to sing, and you will have to join him.\nLike a Hurricane or Sweetest Lover These decisions involve the lyrics of a song or two. These songs include Rolling Like a Hurricane, Like A Lover, Through the Rain, and Cherry Lips.\nBuy the Disabler or Refuse It If you decide to purchase the Disabler, you will receive a notification informing you about your purchase of a black market device to render the Nova Core device disabled.\nIf you refuse to take Disabler, the dealer will allow you to send your Tech guy to make the choice.\nLets Play or No Thanks If you say no thanks, you will very obviously decline to play the game and walk away from it. This will result in the brain getting upset at you.\nIf you select Let’s Play, you will need to play a game where you have to guess the location of the ball. Guessing this location correctly will result in a prize of 1000 credits. However, once you are done, you will still be asked to play again.\nIf you decide to play again, you will have to pay an amount of 1500 units. However, the ball will not be inside the cup you choose. This is because of the fact that the whole game is one big con. At best, you will be able to win the first attempt and leave. These will be the consequences of your choices in Guardians of the Galaxy\nPlay Slots Spending 500 units will result in you getting a jackpot. However, the machine will malfunction.

Because of this, they will not take a knee.\nSlow clapping is a sarcastic gesture. Your enemies, however, will be unable to spot this.\nAppeal or Berate If you choose to appeal, you will claim that this is not the real you.

Your Step-by-Step Guide to Making the Best Decisions in Guardians of the Galaxy</p><p>The Marvel cinematic universe is a vast and exciting place filled with superheroes, villains, and everything in between. One of the most beloved and unconventional groups of heroes in this universe is the Guardians of the Galaxy. Made up of a motley crew of characters from different worlds and walks of life, the Guardians embark on thrilling adventures across the cosmos.</p><p>As a player of the Guardians of the Galaxy video game, you take on the role of Peter Quill, also known as Star-Lord, as he leads the team on their latest mission. One of the key elements of the game is decision-making, as the choices you make will determine the outcome of the story. In this guide, we&rsquo;ll show you how to make the best decisions in the game and unleash the ultimate power of the Guardians.</p><p>Step 1: Understand Your Characters</p><p>Before making any decisions in the game, it&rsquo;s crucial to understand your characters and their motivations. Each member of the Guardians has their own unique personality and backstory, and this will influence the choices they make. It&rsquo;s important to pay attention to how they respond to different situations and the consequences of those actions. Understanding your characters will help you make decisions that are in line with their personalities and goals.</p><p>Step 2: Consider the Consequences</p><p>Every decision you make in the game will have consequences, some more significant than others. When faced with a choice, take the time to consider what the outcome might be. Will your decision lead to a positive outcome for your team, or will it create more problems? Will it affect your relationships with other characters? Will it impact the overall story and ending of the game? By considering the consequences of your decisions, you can make choices that will benefit your team and help you achieve your goals.</p><p>Step 3: Communicate With Your Team</p><p>The Guardians of the Galaxy are a team, and communication is key to their success. When making decisions, it&rsquo;s important to consider the opinions and input of your team members. Talking to them and understanding their perspectives can help you make the best decisions for the group. Additionally, building strong relationships with your team members can unlock special abilities and dialogue options that can aid you in your mission.</p><p>Step 4: Trust Your Gut</p><p>Sometimes, the best decisions are the ones that come from the heart. In the game, you&rsquo;ll be faced with tough choices that don&rsquo;t always have a clear right or wrong answer. When this happens, trust your instincts and make the decision that feels right to you. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to take risks or go against the norm if it means protecting your team and achieving your goals.</p><p>Step 5: Own Your Choices</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve made a decision, own it. Accept the consequences of your actions and move forward with confidence. Don&rsquo;t second-guess yourself or dwell on what could have been. Remember that every decision you make is an opportunity for growth and learning, and it will ultimately shape the outcome of the game.</p><p>In conclusion, making the best decisions in Guardians of the Galaxy requires understanding your characters, considering the consequences, communicating with your team, trusting your gut, and owning your choices. By following these steps, you&rsquo;ll be able to unleash the ultimate power of the Guardians and lead your team to victory. Happy gaming!</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fg03d5A-0gY style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>When playing Guardians of the Galaxy, you will often come across opportunities to make choices that have different consequences. The choices you make are entirely dependent upon you. However, it is important to know and understand the effects each decision will have on your performance and progress in the game. If you are wondering what the best choices and consequences are in this game, we’ve got you covered. In this guide, we will show you all of the possible choices in all the chapters, and the consequences of each of them.</p><h2 id=guardians-of-the-galaxy-best-choices--consequences-guide>Guardians Of The Galaxy Best Choices & Consequences Guide<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#guardians-of-the-galaxy-best-choices--consequences-guide>#</a></h2><p>Table of Contents</p><h3 id=chapter-one-choices--consequences-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy>Chapter One Choices & Consequences in Guardians of the Galaxy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-one-choices--consequences-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy>#</a></h3><p>There are no important choices and consequences in this chapter of Guardians of the Galaxy. You will only find a few dialogue choices that do not have a lot of consequences.</p><h3 id=chapter-two-choices--consequences-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy>Chapter Two Choices & Consequences in Guardians of the Galaxy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-two-choices--consequences-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy>#</a></h3><h4 id=double-down-or-lie>Double Down or Lie<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#double-down-or-lie>#</a></h4><p>When you face this particular choice in Guardians of the Galaxy, you can choose between either Double Down or Lie.</p><p>If you choose Double Down, you will see Star Lord discussing his past with the captain of the other ship. During this conversation, he will promise that he does not intend on smuggling anything. Drax will enter the cockpit with a box of illegal tech items. This will result in the captain not paying heed to any of your pleas.</p><p>If you choose Lie, you will simply lie and tell the captain that your navigation malfunctioned. Drax will now arrive with a box of illegal goods. Following this, you will be threatened with arrest.</p><h4 id=hide-the-creature-or-hide-the-tech>Hide the Creature or Hide the Tech<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hide-the-creature-or-hide-the-tech>#</a></h4><p>If you pick Hide the Creature, Star Lord will ask Drax to hide the Llama. This will disappoint Rocket, as he wants the technology. To justify his actions, Star Lord will explain that he has had relations in the past with the captain of the other ship. Because of this, he believes that he can convince the captain to allow them to keep the tech. The Star Lord, however, does not feel like the captain will avoid the potential of a biohazard. This means that if you go ahead with this decision, you will receive a fine of 7000 units for smuggling tech that is illegal. The Llama, however, will be with you throughout the entirety of the journey. You will also be able to pet it during certain points of the storyline.</p><p>If you choose to Hide the Tech, you will displease Gomora. Despite this, she will trust you when you tell her that you will be able to talk your way out of the mess. A little while later, you will see a boarding party arriving. You will receive a fine of 8000 units. Further in the game, you will receive lock-on rockets for your ship whenever you battle in space.</p><h4 id=back-pedal-or-stick-up-for-nikki>Back Pedal or Stick Up For Nikki<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#back-pedal-or-stick-up-for-nikki>#</a></h4><p>If you choose the Back Pedal option, you will quite literally backpedal and then say that Nikki has a conviction. She will not be happy with this action. However, regardless of whatever happens, both of you will be going up in the elevator.</p><p>If you choose Stick Up For Nikki, Star Lord will tell her mother that she took care of herself quite well and that her mother should be proud. However, Nikki’s mother will continue to remain upset at her daughter. She will then proceed to lock down the elevator.</p><h4 id=make-a-joke-back-up-ko-rel-reaactivate-elevator>Make A Joke, Back-Up Ko-Rel, Reaactivate Elevator<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#make-a-joke-back-up-ko-rel-reaactivate-elevator>#</a></h4><p>Of these different choices in Guardians of the Galaxy, if you choose to Make a Joke, Star Lord will make a joke about getting stuck inside an elevator. However, Nikki and her mother will not be very appreciative of the joke and will make their displeasure known. They will then continue to argue among themselves. This choice will gradually result in Nikki giving you her passkey as she now trusts you. Because of this, you will be able to enter her room as the story progresses.</p><p>If you decide to Back Up Ko-Rel, you will tell Nikki how you feel her mother is on to her. Ko-Rel will not allow anybody to leave the elevator until somebody gives her answers. Nikki, however, will end up losing her key because of her vague attempts to lie and say she can fit through things easier because of her small size.</p><p>If you pick Reactivate Elevator, you will fail in trying to stop the lockdown. Both Nikki, as well as her mother, will be express their frustration with you. Nikki will also express hesitation at trusting you.</p><h4 id=side-with-ko-rel-or-try-to-help-nikki>Side with Ko-Rel or Try to Help Nikki<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#side-with-ko-rel-or-try-to-help-nikki>#</a></h4><p>Deciding to side with Ko-Rel will result in Star Lord advising Nikki to tell her mother all she needs to know. Star Lord will express his amazement at Nikki’s young age of just 12. Nikki will eventually trust you and hand over her passkey.</p><p>If you decide to try to help Nikki, you will tell Nikki about the glitch which is present across all the systems. Nikki will mention the security being down, after which you will agree with her. After this, Ko-Rel will order Nikki to clear her pockets. However, Ko-Rel will be met with a stern no from Nikki.</p><h4 id=tell-ko-rel-the-truth-divert-attention-take-the-blame>Tell Ko-Rel the Truth, Divert Attention, Take The Blame<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tell-ko-rel-the-truth-divert-attention-take-the-blame>#</a></h4><p>Choosing to tell Ko-Rel the truth about Nikki having a passkey will result in Nikki getting upset with you and giving up her passkey.</p><p>Picking the option to Divert Attention will result in you telling Ko-Rel that you still harbor feelings for her. This will result in both, Nikki as well as Ko-Rel getting surprised. Nikki will also begin to doubt her ability to trust you, and you will find out that Nikki created the key herself. Despite this, she will still lose the key.</p><h4 id=do-the-math-or-ignore-the-math>Do The Math or Ignore The Math<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#do-the-math-or-ignore-the-math>#</a></h4><p>If you choose to do the math, you will come to the realization that Nikki is quite likely your daughter. Ko-Rel will offer to pay off your fine over a period of three cycles. You will have to pay an amount of either 7 or 8000 units for smuggling, and this depends on your earlier choices.</p><p>However, if you decide to ignore the math, Star Lord will offer his toy chewie the choice to either stay or come back to him. Star Lord will play with the Wookie, even mimicking the voice of a Wookie when doing so. The chewie will then realize that he is alright and choose to stay back with Ko-Rel.</p><h3 id=chapter-3-choices--consequences-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy>Chapter 3 Choices & Consequences in Guardians of the Galaxy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-3-choices--consequences-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy>#</a></h3><h4 id=hear-out-drax-call-on-groot-focus-on-rocket>Hear Out Drax, Call on Groot, Focus on Rocket<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hear-out-drax-call-on-groot-focus-on-rocket>#</a></h4><p>If you decide to hear Drax out, Star Lord will explain to the team that Fing Fang Foom is a monster with a great legacy. It is feared right across the entirety of the galaxy. He will also explain that such a death would be a glorious one, however, the team will counter this statement, claiming that death is not the objective. Rocket will then claim that the best choice is to sell Gamura’s figures. Groot will gather the team together and suggest that everybody needs to combine each other’s ideas.</p><p>If you decide to Call on Groot, you will hear him out. Rocket will also listen to Groot and help translate his message. Groot will suggest that all the ideas need to be combined together.</p><p>If you choose to Focus on Rocket, you will lean more towards Rocket’s idea of selling Gamura’s figures. Rocket will back this up by suggesting that her collection will attract plenty of buyers who will not mind paying high prices.</p><h4 id=vote-to-sell-groot-or-rocket>Vote to Sell Groot or Rocket<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#vote-to-sell-groot-or-rocket>#</a></h4><p>If you decide to sell Groot, Star Lord will thank him for volunteering to be sold. He will explain how Groot is a more convincing choice. Along with this, he also promises to help rescue Groot as soon as the transaction has been completed. You will be offered the opportunity to change your mind later, however, this will not make that big of a difference. All it will do is change a few cutscenes and the mission with Lady Hellbender.</p><p>Now, if you decide to Vote to Sell Rocket, you will tell him that he is fearsome on the inside.</p><h4 id=encourage-drax-or-stop-drax>Encourage Drax or Stop Drax<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#encourage-drax-or-stop-drax>#</a></h4><p>Choosing to encourage Drax will quite literally result in you encouraging him, infuriating Rocket in the process. To pacify him, you will then tell him that you will offer him a rise of 10% to his cut. The next time you make the suggestion to toss Rocket, he will get angry again.</p><p>If you decide to stop Drax, Star Lord will end up informing Drax about his intentions to not throw Rocket. Instead, he will decide to find another way.</p><h4 id=stand-your-ground-or-change-your-mind>Stand your Ground or Change your Mind<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#stand-your-ground-or-change-your-mind>#</a></h4><p>If you choose the former, Star Lord will inform Drax of his plans to get Groot into the cage. The only major differences here will be in the form of cutscenes, so there’s not much to worry about.</p><p>If you choose to Change your Mind, you will be able to switch Groot and sell Rocket. This will anger Gamora because of the fact that you had voted on it. However, Rocket will be more than pleased to get inside the cage.</p><h4 id=deflect-qualify-rationalize-compromise-reassure-or-argue>Deflect, Qualify, Rationalize, Compromise, Reassure, or Argue<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#deflect-qualify-rationalize-compromise-reassure-or-argue>#</a></h4><p>Choosing deflect will result in you telling your mother that she used to watch scary movies during her youth. However, she will refuse to budge.</p><h4 id=qualify>Qualify<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#qualify>#</a></h4><p>Choosing to go with Qualify will result in you having to find another way to convince your mother, as she will not budge.</p><h4 id=rationalize>Rationalize<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#rationalize>#</a></h4><p>As the name suggests, you will try to appeal to your mother through rational means. However, despite this, she will need a little more convincing.</p><h4 id=compromise>Compromise<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#compromise>#</a></h4><p>Choosing this option will result in you telling your mother that you can still do some of the same things. You will push her a little more, but she will still not budge.</p><h4 id=reassure>Reassure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#reassure>#</a></h4><p>Choosing reassurance will result in mom finally handing over the cash because you manage to convince her about it not being a very big deal.</p><h4 id=argue>Argue<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#argue>#</a></h4><p>Your mother finally hands over the cash once you tell her how you are not such a little kid anymore.</p><h3 id=chapter-4>Chapter 4<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-4>#</a></h3><h4 id=side-with-rocket-or-gamora>Side With Rocket or Gamora<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#side-with-rocket-or-gamora>#</a></h4><p>This choice will result in Rocket claiming that agreeing with him is the smart thing to do as a consequence in Guardians of the Galaxy (GOTG). He will also poke some fun at Gamora.</p><h4 id=side-with-gamora>Side With Gamora<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#side-with-gamora>#</a></h4><p>Star Lord will claim that Gamora is a trustworthy person and that he trusts her with his own life.</p><h4 id=take-the-lead-or-encourage-drax>Take The Lead Or Encourage Drax<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#take-the-lead-or-encourage-drax>#</a></h4><p>Choosing to Take the Lead will result in you quite literally taking the lead. You will introduce yourself to the queen, despite the fact that she does not know who you are. You will then go on to ask Drax to show the queen the monster. However, Drax will express confusion at this request.</p><h4 id=encourage-drax>Encourage Drax<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#encourage-drax>#</a></h4><p>Encouraging Drax will result in him agreeing because of the fact that you are not great at negotiation. He will then proceed to speak with the woman and tell her that she needs to be well-versed with the specific weapon. The queen will also offer to give Drax a demonstration. Depending on your earlier choice, you will either show the queen Rocket or Groot.</p><h4 id=encourage-cuteness-or-push-rocket>Encourage Cuteness or Push Rocket<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#encourage-cuteness-or-push-rocket>#</a></h4><p>If you choose to encourage cuteness, you will convince the queen about Rocket’s cuteness when he drinks from a saucer. The queen will enjoy this, and even express her appreciation at his attitude. Quite weirdly, though, this appreciation will trigger Rocket into shooting at everyone.</p><p>If you choose to push ferociousness, you will need to convince the queen that Rocket is genuinely strong. You will have to convince her that Rocket can actually be a potent killing machine.</p><h4 id=groot-price-negotiation-offer-lesssupport-drax>Groot Price Negotiation (Offer Less/Support Drax)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#groot-price-negotiation-offer-lesssupport-drax>#</a></h4><p>If you offer less, Star Lord will counter you with an offer for 10,000 units. While Gamora and Star Lord will agree about 10,000 units being perfect, Drax will still stand by his request of 20,000 units. Eventually, he will settle for an amount of 9,537 units, and Groot will be taken away.</p><p>If you choose to support Drax’s request for 20,000 units, Lady Hellbender will offer 15,000 units, with the condition that Drax needs to stay. Countering this, Drax will explain his other commitments, and Hellbender will finally agree on a price of 12,000 units.</p><h4 id=price-negotiation-for-rocket-stick-with-offeroffer-less>Price Negotiation for Rocket (Stick with Offer/Offer Less)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#price-negotiation-for-rocket-stick-with-offeroffer-less>#</a></h4><p>If you choose to stick with the original offer, you will have the opportunity to agree to Rocket’s suggestion of 20,000 units. You will try to lie to him by mentioning the fact that you have another potential dealer. However, Rocket will call your bluff, and now you will need to shoot your way out.</p><p>If you choose to offer less, you will infuriate Rocket, who will start to shoot up the place.</p><h3 id=chapter-5-choices--consequences-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy>Chapter 5 Choices & Consequences in Guardians of the Galaxy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-5-choices--consequences-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy>#</a></h3><h4 id=ask-about-crime-or-ask-about-nova-corps>Ask about Crime or Ask about Nova Corps<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ask-about-crime-or-ask-about-nova-corps>#</a></h4><p>If you choose the ask about crime option, Star Lord will ask the criminal about the crime, however, there will be no response from the criminal.</p><p>If you ask about the Nova Corps, the criminal will deny knowing a lot. However, he will still request your help in getting out. You will then receive the option to interact with the holding cell if you wish to.</p><h4 id=put-it-down-or-speak-into-helmet>Put It Down Or Speak Into Helmet<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#put-it-down-or-speak-into-helmet>#</a></h4><p>If you choose to put the helmet down, Star Lord will choose to not pay attention to the voices on the other side. He will throw his helmet to the other side, and a notification will then appear, saying that the Guardians agree that keeping quiet was the right choice. You will be witness to the executions of Nova Corps members as you leave.</p><p>If you decide to speak into the helmet, you will hear voices through the helmet. However, these voices will not sound like those of Nova Corps. The voices will offer help when you tell them you are in search of the centurion. The voices say they will come to you when you tell them where you are.</p><p>You will then have the ability to choose if you want to retreat or stall and defend yourself.</p><h3 id=chapter-6>Chapter 6<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-6>#</a></h3><h4 id=defer-to-gamora-tell-the-truth-pretend-you-remember-freeze-and-say-nothing>Defer to Gamora, Tell The Truth, Pretend You Remember, Freeze and Say Nothing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#defer-to-gamora-tell-the-truth-pretend-you-remember-freeze-and-say-nothing>#</a></h4><p>If you decide to defer to Gamora, she will tell you how both of you fought together.</p><p>If you decide to tell the truth, Star Lord claims that he has no memory of a previous encounter, before apologizing. He will sing upon becoming upset at Star Lord.</p><p>If you pretend that you remember, he will laugh and sing upon being relieved.</p><p>If you freeze, Rocket will get upset. He will then begin to sing, and you will have to join him.</p><h4 id=like-a-hurricane-or-sweetest-lover>Like a Hurricane or Sweetest Lover<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#like-a-hurricane-or-sweetest-lover>#</a></h4><p>These decisions involve the lyrics of a song or two. These songs include Rolling Like a Hurricane, Like A Lover, Through the Rain, and Cherry Lips.</p><h4 id=buy-the-disabler-or-refuse-it>Buy the Disabler or Refuse It<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#buy-the-disabler-or-refuse-it>#</a></h4><p>If you decide to purchase the Disabler, you will receive a notification informing you about your purchase of a black market device to render the Nova Core device disabled.</p><p>If you refuse to take Disabler, the dealer will allow you to send your Tech guy to make the choice.</p><h4 id=lets-play-or-no-thanks>Lets Play or No Thanks<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#lets-play-or-no-thanks>#</a></h4><p>If you say no thanks, you will very obviously decline to play the game and walk away from it. This will result in the brain getting upset at you.</p><p>If you select Let’s Play, you will need to play a game where you have to guess the location of the ball. Guessing this location correctly will result in a prize of 1000 credits. However, once you are done, you will still be asked to play again.</p><p>If you decide to play again, you will have to pay an amount of 1500 units. However, the ball will not be inside the cup you choose. This is because of the fact that the whole game is one big con. At best, you will be able to win the first attempt and leave.
