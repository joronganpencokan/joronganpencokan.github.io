It was the default output for many years. Nowadays, it may sound outdated, but they are still used extensively. Usually, Coax connections are used to receive a connection in our homes from a satellite. If you have an old cable satellite box at your home, you must know that it only outputs Coax. Now the problem arises when you buy a new TV. As technology has advanced, new TVs do not support Coax and supports only HDMI and USB. So here we are with the solution to convert Coaxial to HDMI cable. How to Convert Coaxial Cable to HDMI There are plenty of Coaxial to HDMI cable connectors available in the market. You can get them online or offline. In this article, we will tell you how to convert Coaxial cable to HDMI. But first, let us see what an HDMI and a Coax cable is and the difference between them.\nContents\nHow to Convert Coaxial Cable to HDMI Coaxial Cable HDMI Cable 2 Ways to Convert Coaxial cable to HDMI Upgrade Set Top Box Buy a Coax to HDMI converter Coaxial Cable Invented in the 19th century, Coaxial cable was used to carry out radio signals. It has a three-layer architecture. Coax cables are made up of a copper core and two-layer insulation above that. It was meant to transfer analog signals with a minimum of hindrance or interception. Coax cables were extensively used in radios, telegraphs, and televisions. It has now been replaced by fiber and other technologies that promise faster transmission.\nCoax cables are prone to data/signal loss over distance. Fiber technology is faster and more reliable than Coax but requires more investment. Coaxial cables require minimum investment and maintenance.\nHDMI Cable HDMI stands for High Definition Multimedia Interface. It was invented in Japan by the Japanese TV manufacturers and is the most popular replacement for the coax cable at homes. It carries out signals among devices with a colossal amount of data and broadcasts signals at high definition or ultra-high definition interface. It carries audio too.\nHDMI is a digital cable. It is void of any data losses. It carries more data than coaxial cable and can deliver signals at a much faster speed. It performs digital transmission and is hence void of any interference or hindrance. Nowadays, every TV, broadband, and other cable device comprises HDMI ports instead of coaxial ports.\n2 Ways to Convert Coaxial cable to HDMI There are some methods by which you can convert your Coaxial cable to HDMI or vice-versa. You may require upgraded equipment to get things right. Now, let us hop right into the methods we can follow:\n1.

Now is the time to replace and get an HDMI supporting set-top box.\nReplacing an old box for a new one is the easiest way, but if your service provider is asking for an illogical replacement charge, then it might not be an ideal solution for you.\n2.

All you need to do is connect the converter with coax input first and then attach the HDMI port of your device to the converter. Follow the steps:\nConnect one end of the Coax to your cable box Coax Out port. Take the other end and connect it to the converter labelled as Coax In Now take the HDMI cable to connect to the device and converter the same as you did with coax cable. Now you need to turn on the device to test the installed connection. Now that you’ve connected the converter and other necessary cables and switched on your device, your device must start receiving signals. If it does not appear in the few minutes, then consider selecting the input method as HDMI-2.\nThis method is very easy. You only need to invest some money in buying the signal converter, that’s it. Post that, the conversion is just a matter of minutes.
