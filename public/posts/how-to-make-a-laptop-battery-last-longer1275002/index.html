As a result, the battery life of a laptop is of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, batteries tend to lose their capacity over time, leaving us with the frustrating challenge of having to frequently recharge our devices. But what if we told you that there’s a hack that can double the lifespan of your laptop battery in just a few minutes?\nIntroducing the Revolutionary Hack\nThe hack we’re talking about is called “Calibrating Your Laptop Battery,” and it’s a well-kept secret that has been used by tech experts for years. The process is simple, and once you know how to do it, you’ll never have to worry about your laptop battery life again.\nHow to Calibrate Your Laptop Battery\nThe first step in calibrating your laptop battery is to discharge it completely. This means running your device until it shuts down due to a lack of power. Once your laptop has shut down, leave it for a few hours to ensure that the battery has completely discharged.\nOnce the battery has discharged, plug in your laptop and let it charge to 100%. You should also leave your device plugged in for a few hours after it has fully charged to ensure that the battery is completely charged.\nThe final step is the most crucial – unplug your laptop and use it until it shuts down once again. By doing this, you’re allowing your device to recalibrate its power management settings, ensuring that it accurately displays the battery life.\nWhy Calibrating Your Laptop Battery Is Important\nCalibrating your laptop battery is important because it ensures that your device is accurately displaying the battery life. Over time, batteries can become less efficient, which can lead to incorrect battery readings. By recalibrating your laptop’s power management settings, you’ll know exactly how much battery life you have left, and you’ll have a better idea of when you need to recharge your device.\nIn addition, calibrating your laptop battery can help to extend its lifespan. By ensuring that the battery is accurately calibrated, you won’t overcharge or undercharge it, which can lead to a shorter battery life. This means that you’ll be able to use your laptop for longer periods, without having to worry about replacing the battery anytime soon.\nFinal Thoughts\nCalibrating your laptop battery is a quick and easy process that can double the lifespan of your device’s battery. While it may seem like a small thing, it can make a huge difference in your daily life. By knowing exactly how much battery life you have left, you’ll be able to plan your work, play, and other activities more efficiently. So, the next time you’re struggling with your laptop’s battery life, give this revolutionary hack a try – you won’t regret it!\nHere are the best ways to make your laptop battery last longer.\nChange Your Power Profile to Power Saver Windows laptops come with the option of changing the power profile in the Power and Sleep Settings menu. Select Battery Saver mode to optimize your laptop to focus on efficiency over performance. That can go a long way to extending battery life. Lower Screen Brightness A bright, high-resolution screen is a major factor in draining your laptop’s battery life. While you can’t do much about its resolution once you’ve bought it, you can lower the brightness to make it use as little power as possible. This will make the laptop more dull to look at though, so it’s not the best for watching films of playing games, and can make it hard to see the screen when you’re in a bright environment (especially outdoors).\nTurn Off Keyboard Backlighting Keyboard backlighting is really useful for typing in the dark, but it also requires power, which means it’s another source of battery usage. If battery life is important, do your best to do without the backlighting and turn it off.\nUnplug Any External Devices You Don’t Need External devices all draw power from your laptop, whether they’re exclusively powered by it, or use it to charge their own internal battery. If you have devices like your phone, external hard drives, or external displays plugged into USB ports on your laptop, they will draw power from it and therefore reduce your laptop’s battery life. If you aren’t using them, or can charge them somewhere else, unplug them to extend your laptop’s battery.\nKeep It Cool Batteries remain more efficient and last longer when kept around room temperature or even slightly below, so do your best to keep your laptop from getting hot. That means making sure that you don’t use it in rooms that are too hot, or in direct snlight, and ideally, make sure the laptop itself has plenty of ventilation to ensure it can cool down its components well enough toi avoid excess heat build up.\nTurn-off or Hibernate When Not In Use If you’re not using your laptop, turn it off, or set it to hibernate after a short period of inactivity. Even when sitting idle it will consume battery life—just because the screen’s off doesn’t mean it isn’t slowly de-charging. Shut it down if you’re done using it.\nWhy Does My Laptop Battery Last Only 30 Minutes? Some laptops just have short battery life because they have powerful components, a small battery, or have grown old. You can use the above techniques to try to extend it, but 30 minutes of battery life probably means your battery has grown inefficient and lost charge over its lifetime. It may be time for a battery or laptop replacement. Alternatively, leave it plugged in and use it as a type of desktop system.\nCan I Leave My Laptop Plugged In All Night? Yes, it’s fine to leave your laptop plugged in overnight if you have a modern laptop. Newer machines have circuitry built-in to cycle the battery during long periods of charging to ensure you still get maximum life out of the battery. As far as older models go, however, you should check with the manufacturer to see what they recommend. An old rule of thumb was charge to 80% and then unplug, but, of course, that’s nearly impossible to do while you are asleep.\nIs It Bad to Leave Your Laptop Plugged In All The Time? The same rules apply as above: It’s fine if you have a modern laptop. If you find yourself using your laptop plugged in all the time, consider replacing it with a desktop machine. Those are, obviously, meant to be plugged in all the time and can offer more power for less money.\nHow do I make a Lenovo laptop battery last longer? In addition to the above, Lenovo recommends turning off Bluetooth. If your Lenovo Ideapad fails to charge past 60 percent when plugged in, you might want to update the BIOS version. Go to the Lenovo support site to look up your model, install the most recent update, and reboot your PC. How do I make my Mac laptop battery last longer? To extend your Mac’s battery, turn off services you’re not using, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or AirPlay. Also, go to System Preferences \u003e Energy Saver and activate settings to turn off the display after a specific interval or put hard disks to sleep when possible. You can also calibrate your Mac’s battery by letting it drain before plugging it in to charge fully. How long do laptop batteries usually last? A laptop battery’s lifespan depends on factors like heat and usage, but the average laptop battery lasts approximately 2 to 4 years or 1,000 charging cycles. In addition to the above, Lenovo recommends turning off Bluetooth. If your Lenovo Ideapad fails to charge past 60 percent when plugged in, you might want to update the BIOS version.
