Rooting your Android device can help you customize it and make it work better for you. However, it comes with some limitations especially with regards to apps that require a secure environment.\nIn this article, we will show you how to keep apps from detecting root access on your Android device.\nStep 1: Use Magisk Manager\nMagisk Manager is a free third-party app that allows you to manage root access on your Android device. It is designed to bypass root detection by creating a virtual environment where you can run your apps without the apps detecting the root access.\nTo use Magisk Manager, you have to download the app from the official website and install it on your device. Once installed, open the app and click on the “install” button to install Magisk on your device. After installation, restart your device.\nStep 2: Install Magisk module\nAfter restarting your device, open Magisk Manager and click on the “Downloads” tab. Look for the module “MagiskHide Props Config” and install it. This module allows you to trick apps into thinking that your device is not rooted.\nStep 3: Configure MagiskHide\nAfter installing the Magisk module, open Magisk Manager and go to the “MagiskHide” section. Look for the app that you want to hide root access from and enable MagiskHide for that app. This will prevent the app from detecting the root access on your device.\nStep 4: Verify MagiskHide is working\nTo verify that MagiskHide is working, you can download a root checker app and check if it detects root access. If it doesn’t, then MagiskHide is working correctly.\nConclusion: Rooting your Android device is a great way to customize it and make it work better for you. However, it comes with some limitations when it comes to using secure apps. By using Magisk Manager and the MagiskHide module, you can bypass root detection and use your favorite apps without any limitations. Give it a try and see for yourself!\nRoot privilege is really very useful, for several purposes in android, especially if you are a geek and you love to play with your Android device and customize it the way you like. You can feel the perks of root in android only if you root your device, though there are some downsides too. And here is the point, if you are one of the geeks, and have your Android device rooted, you are surely feeling its privilege. But, there are some cases that some apps may not work in your device if they detect you have the root access. To be more clear, some apps refuse to run in a rooted device. This is an occasional case, but still, you may want to overcome it. If you’re the one who is not being able to run an useful app because you’ve had your device rooted, you need not to think about unrooting or else, since there is a solution to it. The solution is all about to hide root access from apps that detect root on android, and here we are sharing the method (the app, to be precise) to do it.\nThere is an app, Hide my Root available in the Google Play Store which you can download and install for free in your device. The first thing you’ll be required to do is to download and install the Hide my Root from the Google Play store in your device. After you have it installed it in your device, open this app whenever you encounter an app that refuses to install or run because it has detected that you are rooted. Hit the Hide su binary option and the superuser binary associated with rooting will be obfuscated, allowing you to run just about any app you want. Some apps will still detect your root, but the problem will be far less complicated than before. There will also be cases when you’ll be required to uninstall the SU app from your device. But you need not to worry, you can install it back anytime you need it from the Google Play. You can also have the option to set a password in this app, which will help you increase your security.\nThis is an ad supporter app and you can anytime upgrade it to ad-free version with the payment of just £0.99. Enjoy the process to Hide Root Access from Apps that detect root on your Android, and feel the privilege.
