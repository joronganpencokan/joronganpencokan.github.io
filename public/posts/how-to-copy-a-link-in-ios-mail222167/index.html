Tap Copy.Go to the place you want to paste the link, press and hold, and then tap Paste. How to Copy a Link in the iOS Mail App Copying a URL from the Mail app on an iPhone or iPad can be done with a single tap. There’s also a hidden menu that can be accessed by tapping and holding the link.\nOpen the Mail app and tap the email that contains the link you want to copy to open it. It can be from any email provider you access through the Mail app on your phone, including iCloud, Gmail, and others. Press lightly on the URL link in the email until a new menu shows up that contains several options, including Copy. If you hard-press the URL, a screen displays with different options. Tap the body of the email to close that screen and try again to press lightly on the URL. Hard-press 3D Touch was available beginning with the iPhone 6S. It was removed in iPhone XR. Tap Copy. If you don’t see it, scroll down the menu (past Open and Add to Reading List). You don’t receive a confirmation that you copied the link, but the menu disappears. Go to the place you want to paste the link. This can be an email, message, note, calendar, or any app that accepts the paste command. Tap the text-entry area to position the cursor. Press the screen in the text-entry area. When a bubble appears, lift your finger. Select Paste in the menu bar that appears to paste the URL. Tips on Copying Links on an iPhone or iPad The copy and paste process is simple once you get the hang of the light press. Here are a few tips on how to handle situations you may encounter:\nOpen the Mail app and tap the email that contains the link you want to copy to open it. It can be from any email provider you access through the Mail app on your phone, including iCloud, Gmail, and others.\nPress lightly on the URL link in the email until a new menu shows up that contains several options, including Copy.\nIf you hard-press the URL, a screen displays with different options. Tap the body of the email to close that screen and try again to press lightly on the URL. Hard-press 3D Touch was available beginning with the iPhone 6S. It was removed in iPhone XR.\nTap Copy.

When a bubble appears, lift your finger.\nSelect Paste in the menu bar that appears to paste the URL.\nIf you know and trust the sender, it is safe to copy a URL from that person. However, don’t copy a link from a stranger or sender you don’t recognize.\nDid you see the magnifying glass? If you highlight the text instead of seeing a menu, it’s because you’re not actually holding down on the link. It’s possible that there isn’t a link there and it only looks like there is, or maybe you tapped the text next to the link. If the link text looks strange or long, this is normal in some emails. For example, the link in an email you received as part of an email list or subscription often tends to be long with dozens of letters and numbers. If you trust the sender of the email, it’s appropriate to trust the links they send, too. Copying links in other apps often shows other options. For example, if you use the Chrome app on your iPhone or iPad and want to copy the link that’s stored within an image, you get options for copying the URL but also for saving the picture, opening the picture, opening the picture in a new tab or Incognito tab, and a few others. The menu that displays when tapping-and-holding links in the Mail app can differ between emails. For example, a tweet in an email might have an option to open it in Twitter.
