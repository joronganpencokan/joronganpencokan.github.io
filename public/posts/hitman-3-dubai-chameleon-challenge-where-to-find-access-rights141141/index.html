With an array of fascinating missions and contracts, the game never fails to deliver on its promise of providing an immersive experience.\nOne such mission, the Dubai Chameleon Challenge, is a popular favorite among gamers. In this mission, Agent 47 takes on the role of a chameleon and has to blend in with the crowd to complete his mission.\nHowever, the Dubai Chameleon Challenge comes with a twist. To unlock a particular area, players need to discover a secret location and crack the code. Sounds exciting, doesn’t it? So, let’s dive into the mystery and uncover the secret location.\nBody:\nThe Dubai Chameleon Challenge presents players with the unique task of blending into the crowd to carry out the mission. The challenge is set in a luxury hotel in Dubai, where Agent 47 has to assassinate two targets. The twist lies in unlocking a specific restricted area of the hotel.\nThe first step to unlocking the secret location is to locate the keypad. The keypad is found behind a painting in a room on the fourth floor of the hotel. Players can access the room by taking the employee staircase, which is to the right of the elevator.\nOnce you are in the room with the painting, players need to use their instinct mode to find a small switch on the right side of the painting. Simply push the switch, and the painting will slide open to reveal the keypad.\nNow, this is where the real challenge begins. Players need to crack the code to unlock the restricted area. The code varies from game to game, so there is no universal code. However, there are a few hints that players can use to crack the code.\nFirstly, players need to pay attention to the keypad’s markings. They range from A to G and have different numbers assigned to each letter. Secondly, players need to keep an eye out for a clue that will help them determine the code.\nThe clue can be found by overhearing a conversation between hotel staff members. They will mention a particular VIP guest who is staying in the hotel. Players can then use the guest’s name to generate a code by matching the letters with the keypad markings.\nFor example, if the VIP guest’s name is Mitchell, players can generate a code by matching the letters to the keypad markings. The code would be 6549924.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the Dubai Chameleon Challenge is one of the most exciting missions in Hitman 3. The challenge of unlocking the secret location adds an extra layer of mystery and fun to the game. With a bit of patience and attention to detail, players can crack the code and unlock the restricted area to complete the Dubai Mission. So, put on your detective hats and embark on an exciting adventure filled with thrills and suspense.\nTo complete Hitman 3 Dubai chameleon challenge, you need to collect all the different costumes in the mission and wear them.
