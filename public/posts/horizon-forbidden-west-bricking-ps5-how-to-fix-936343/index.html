However, it’s also causing concern among PlayStation 5 (PS5) owners, who could end up with a bricked console if they try to play the game. Sony has confirmed that this is a possibility, and warned all PS5 owners to be careful when playing Horizon Forbidden West. Fortunately, there’s an easy fix you need that could help you avoid this nightmare scenario.\nWhat is Horizon Forbidden West, and Why is it Causing Concern?\nHorizon Forbidden West is an action role-playing game that follows the story of Aloy, a young hunter and archer, who is searching for answers about her past in a lush and vibrant post-apocalyptic world. The game is set to be released in February 2022 on both PS5 and PS4 consoles.\nThe concern among PS5 owners arises from reports that the game could cause their console to be bricked.

If you don’t restart your console after playing the game, it’s more likely that your console will be bricked. Therefore, it’s vital to make a habit of shutting down your console after you finish playing Horizon Forbidden West every time.\nIt’s unclear how long you need to leave your console shut down before restarting it. Some experts have suggested it could be between ten and fifteen minutes, while others have suggested letting it cool down completely for an hour. However, it’s best to check with Sony for further clarification and guidance, as leaving your console for too long could cause other issues with your PS5.\nConclusion\nHorizon Forbidden West is one of the most anticipated games of 2022. However, the possibility of bricking your PS5 has understandably raised concerns among gamers. Luckily, there is one easy fix you need to avoid this problem: always remember to shut down and restart your console after playing the game.\nWhile this may seem like a minor inconvenience, it’s a small price to pay to ensure that your console remains in perfect working order. So, don’t let the potential threat of bricking keep you from playing one of the most exciting games of the year. Just remember to shut down your console after each gaming session, and you’ll be good to go!\nEver since the release of Horizon Forbidden West, it has been well received by not only critics but also a fair share of audiences.
