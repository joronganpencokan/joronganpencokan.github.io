There are different storage capacities available, which means you need to choose your ideal size. SSDs are available in various storage capacities ranging from 256GB to 4TB.\nSSDs from brands like Samsung, Western Digital, and Kingston are reliable options. If you’re on a budget, you can opt for microparts, which come highly recommended.\nStep 3: Get your tools Ready Before starting the installation process, ensure you have the right tools at your disposal. Here are some of the essential items you need:\nThe SSD itself Screwdriver SATA data cable SATA power cable Anti-static wristband/human touch to ground yourself Optional: SSD mounting kit Step 4: Install the SSD Installation is the most crucial part of this process. Here’s how to do it:\nPower off and unplug your computer, and remove the case cover. Place your anti-static wristband. Identify an available SSD slot on the motherboard. Carefully insert the SSD into the slot. Use the screws provided in your mount kit to secure the SSD in place. Connect one side of the SATA data cable to the SSD and other otherside to the motherboard. Connect the SATA power cable to the back of the SSD Carefully close up the case and power on the PC. Make sure the SSD is recognized in the BIOS or Disk Management. Step 5: Clone your Primary Drive to your second SSD Once you’ve installed your SSD, it’s essential to move your Operating System (OS) or some of your files to your new storage device.\nThe most popular software for cloning is Macrium Reflect; it is free and offers you everything you need to make sure your existing hard drive is cloned without any issues. Here’s how to perform cloning in a few simple steps:\nInstall the Macrium Reflect software and launch it. Clone the primary hard drive to the SSD. Enable booting from both hard drives to allow the PC to boot from the SSD. Conclusion And there you have it! By following these steps, you now have double the storage capacity on your computer. You should notice a significant improvement in your computer’s performance since the SSD is faster and more efficient than traditional hard drives.\nIn addition to its speed and efficiency, SSDs are more reliable than traditional hard drives, making them a better option for data storage. With the right tools and a bit of patience, you can quickly move from a hard disk drive to SSD and get the most out of your computer.\nThis article explains how to install a second SSD into a Windows PC. It covers the necessary parts, the physical installation, and the initialization of the drive using Windows Disk Management. This information pertains to Windows 10, 8.1, 8, and 7.\nWhat to Know\nGather the parts and tools. Unplug the PC and open the case. At an open drive bay, remove the caddy, if there is one, and insert the SSD.Return the drive caddy or screw the drive in place. Connect a SATA data cable to a SATA data port on the motherboard.Plug the SATA power and SATA data connectors into the SSD. Close the case and initialize the drive. Preparation for Installing a Second SSD Installing a second SSD in a Windows PC is a two-step process. First you physically install the drive inside the PC, and then you set it up using the Windows Disk Management utility for the operating system to recognize and use it.\nHere’s what you need if you want to install a second SSD in your PC:\nAn open drive bay in the computer An open SATA data connection on the motherboard An SSD drive A screwdriver to open the case and secure the drive in place A SATA data cable An available SATA power connector An adapter if the SSD will be installed in a bay meant for a 5.25-inch drive Of these items, the most important are an open drive bay and an open SATA data connection on your motherboard. Most computer cases come with a number of open bays, and most motherboards have a number of SATA connections for SSDs and peripherals like Blu-ray drives, but you should check that you have space before investing in a new SSD.\nIf your motherboard doesn’t have any available SATA ports, you can buy a SATA controller that plugs into a PCI or PCIe slot. Similarly, you can use a Molex adapter or SATA power cable splitter if you’re out of SATA power connections.\nLaptops are an exception, as most laptops do not have space to install a second SSD. If your laptop does have space, then you won’t need a SATA connector. Laptop drive bays come with built-in power and data connectors.\nHow to Install a Second SSD in Your Windows PC Files pile up over time. Eventually, you’ll be faced with deleting old files or using a secondary storage device. The easiest way to add storage to your PC is to attach an external drive to your PC and be done. However, if your computer case has the room and you have all the necessary components and tools, you can install a second SSD.\nHere’s how to install a second SSD in a PC:\nBe careful to avoid discharging static while working inside your PC case. Use an anti-static wrist strap if you have one, or ground yourself in some other way if you don’t.\nUnplug your PC from power, and open up the case. Locate an open drive bay. Your case may have one or two different drive bay sizes in addition to peripheral bays. If you don’t have any 2.5 inch drive bays available, purchase a 2.5 to 5.25 inch adapter for your SSD and use a 5.25 inch bay. Remove the drive caddy, and install your new SSD into it. Some cases don’t have drive caddies. You may need to slide your drive directly into the bay and screw it in place, or there might be built-in fasteners that you twist or flip. Consult the owners manual that came with your case if you can’t figure it out. Install the caddy back into the drive bay. Depending on your case, the caddy may snap into place automatically, or you may have to use a fastener of some sort. Locate a free SATA data cable port on your motherboard, and install a SATA data cable. Locate a free SATA power connector. Use a Molex to SATA power adapter or a power splitter if you don’t have a free SATA power connector. Plug the SATA power and data connectors into your SSD drive. The power connector is the longer of the two connectors on your SSD. Note the orientation of the L-shaped connectors, and be careful to install the connectors in the correct orientation. Carefully verify that all of the cables are seated securely, and make sure you didn’t accidentally unplug anything or knock anything loose. Close your case up, connect everything back up, and turn on your computer. How to Initialize a New SSD in Windows Once you’ve successfully installed your second SSD and plugged everything back in, it’s time to turn on your PC and make sure everything works. If Windows doesn’t recognize any of your drives or peripherals, power down and check for any loose or unplugged wires. If everything is in working order, then you can go ahead and set up your new SSD.\nUnplug your PC from power, and open up the case.\nLocate an open drive bay.\nYour case may have one or two different drive bay sizes in addition to peripheral bays.

Before you can actually use it, you have to initialize and then format it for use with Windows. After completing this process, your new SSD will be available to save new files and transfer old files from your original drive to free up space.\nHere’s how to set up a newly installed SSD in Windows:\nNavigate to Control Panel \u003e Disk Management. In Windows 7, click the Start button, right click Computer, and choose Manage to access Disk Management. If prompted to initialize the disk, select GPT (GUID Partition Table) and click OK. If you’re using Windows 7, choose MBR (Master Boot Record). If the setup wizard starts automatically, skip to step 5. Otherwise, scroll the disk management window until you find your new SSD. You can easily identify your new SSD as it will be the only one that is unallocated. Right click, and select New Simple Volume. Click Next. Make sure the two numbers match, and click Next. If you want to make multiple partitions on this one drive, enter the desired partition size instead of matching the numbers. Select a drive letter if you don’t like the default one, and click Next. Use the NTFS file system unless you have a reason to do otherwise, leave the allocation unit size as it is, enter a volume label if you desire, and click Next. Verify the information, and click Finish. Your second SSD is now ready to use.

Laptop drive bays come with built-in power and data connectors.</p><h2 id=how-to-install-a-second-ssd-in-your-windows-pc>How to Install a Second SSD in Your Windows PC<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-install-a-second-ssd-in-your-windows-pc>#</a></h2><p>Files pile up over time. Eventually, you&rsquo;ll be faced with deleting old files or using a secondary storage device. The easiest way to add storage to your PC is to attach an external drive to your PC and be done. However, if your computer case has the room and you have all the necessary components and tools, you can install a second SSD.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s how to install a second SSD in a PC:</p><p>Be careful to avoid discharging static while working inside your PC case. Use an anti-static wrist strap if you have one, or ground yourself in some other way if you don&rsquo;t.</p><ul><li>Unplug your PC from power, and open up the case.</li><li>Locate an open drive bay.</li><li>Your case may have one or two different drive bay sizes in addition to peripheral bays. If you don&rsquo;t have any 2.5 inch drive bays available, purchase a 2.5 to 5.25 inch adapter for your SSD and use a 5.25 inch bay.</li><li>Remove the drive caddy, and install your new SSD into it.</li><li>Some cases don&rsquo;t have drive caddies. You may need to slide your drive directly into the bay and screw it in place, or there might be built-in fasteners that you twist or flip. Consult the owners manual that came with your case if you can&rsquo;t figure it out.</li><li>Install the caddy back into the drive bay.</li><li>Depending on your case, the caddy may snap into place automatically, or you may have to use a fastener of some sort.</li><li>Locate a free SATA data cable port on your motherboard, and install a SATA data cable.</li><li>Locate a free SATA power connector.</li><li>Use a Molex to SATA power adapter or a power splitter if you don&rsquo;t have a free SATA power connector.</li><li>Plug the SATA power and data connectors into your SSD drive.</li><li>The power connector is the longer of the two connectors on your SSD. Note the orientation of the L-shaped connectors, and be careful to install the connectors in the correct orientation.</li><li>Carefully verify that all of the cables are seated securely, and make sure you didn&rsquo;t accidentally unplug anything or knock anything loose.</li><li>Close your case up, connect everything back up, and turn on your computer.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-initialize-a-new-ssd-in-windows>How to Initialize a New SSD in Windows<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-initialize-a-new-ssd-in-windows>#</a></h2><p>Once you&rsquo;ve successfully installed your second SSD and plugged everything back in, it&rsquo;s time to turn on your PC and make sure everything works. If Windows doesn&rsquo;t recognize any of your drives or peripherals, power down and check for any loose or unplugged wires. If everything is in working order, then you can go ahead and set up your new SSD.</p><p>Unplug your PC from power, and open up the case.</p><p>Locate an open drive bay.</p><p>Your case may have one or two different drive bay sizes in addition to peripheral bays.

Before you can actually use it, you have to initialize and then format it for use with Windows. After completing this process, your new SSD will be available to save new files and transfer old files from your original drive to free up space.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s how to set up a newly installed SSD in Windows:</p><ul><li>Navigate to Control Panel > Disk Management.</li><li>In Windows 7, click the Start button, right click Computer, and choose Manage to access Disk Management.</li><li>If prompted to initialize the disk, select GPT (GUID Partition Table) and click OK.</li><li>If you&rsquo;re using Windows 7, choose MBR (Master Boot Record).</li><li>If the setup wizard starts automatically, skip to step 5.
