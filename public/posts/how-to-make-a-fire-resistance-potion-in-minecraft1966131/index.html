The ingredients you’ll need are:\nNether wartMagma creamA water bottle.Blaze powder How to Make a Fire Resistance Potion in Minecraft Once you’ve got everything together, here’s how the process works:\nOpen the Brewing Stand interface.

One Blaze powder will last for the creation of multiple potions. Place a bottle of Water in the bottom left slot in the brewing interface.

Place the Magma Cream in the upper middle slot of the brewing interface.. The Fire potion is now ready, and you can move it to your inventory.

You can still catch on fire when using this potion, so make sure to put yourself out before the potion effects end. How to Get Nether Wart, Blaze Powder, and Magma Cream The components required to craft fire resistance potions are all found in the Nether, so you’ll have to do a bit of dangerous adventuring before you can craft this useful item. There’s a ton of lava in the Nether, and the fire-based Blaze mob, which is one of Minecraft’s toughest mobs to fight, holds the blaze rods required to make blaze powder. The process of obtaining these items gets a lot easier after you’ve done it once and have access to fire resistance potions.\nEquip the Fire Resistance potion.\nDrink the Fire Resistance potion using your use item button.\nWindows 10 and Java Edition: Right click.Pocket Edition: Tap the Fish button.Xbox 360 and Xbox One: Press the left trigger.PS3 and PS4: Press the L2 button.Wii U and Switch: Press the ZL button.

Unless you get lucky with chests, you’ll actually have to fight Blaze enemies to obtain their rods, and then turn the rods into powder.\nYou can obtain the items in any order, but nether wart is the easiest.
