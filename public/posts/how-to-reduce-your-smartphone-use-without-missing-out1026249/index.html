Are you tired of feeling like your phone is taking over your life? Do you find yourself mindlessly scrolling through social media, even when you know you should be doing something else? If so, you’re not alone. Many people struggle with phone addiction, but fortunately, there are ways to break the habit and regain control of your time.\nThe first step in cutting your phone addiction is to recognize how much time you’re spending on your device. This can be done by using tools like Screen Time on your iPhone or Digital Wellbeing on your Android, which will tell you how much time you’re spending on various apps and activities. Once you know how much time you’re spending on your phone, you can start to make changes.\nOne effective strategy for cutting phone addiction is to establish phone-free times and spaces. For example, you might decide to turn off your phone during meals or when you’re spending time with friends and family. You could also designate certain areas of your home as phone-free zones, such as your bedroom or the dinner table. These boundaries will help you resist the temptation to check your phone constantly and create a healthier balance between your digital and real-world lives.\nAnother helpful strategy is to be more intentional with your phone use. Rather than mindlessly scrolling through social media or checking your email every few minutes, set specific goals for what you want to accomplish on your phone. For example, you might decide to spend 15 minutes each day checking your email and responding to messages, or you could set a limit on how much time you spend on social media each day. By being more intentional with your phone use, you’ll be less likely to get sucked into endless scrolling sessions and more likely to stay focused on what’s important.\nIt’s also important to be mindful of the impact that your phone use has on your mental health. If you find that social media or other apps are making you feel anxious or stressed, consider taking a break from them altogether. Alternatively, you could limit the amount of time you spend on these apps and focus more on activities that promote relaxation and well-being, such as meditation, reading, or spending time in nature.\nFinally, don’t be afraid to seek support from others as you work to cut your phone addiction. Talk to your friends and family about your goals and ask them to help you hold yourself accountable. You could also consider joining a support group or seeking professional help if you feel like your phone addiction is interfering with your daily life.\nIn conclusion, cutting your phone addiction doesn’t have to mean completely disconnecting from the world. By establishing phone-free times and spaces, being more intentional with your phone use, and prioritizing your mental health, you can still stay in the loop while regaining control of your time and attention. So why not give it a try and see how much better you feel? Your phone addiction may be gone for good, and you’ll be able to enjoy your life again!\nIf you enjoy Android phone as much as I do, there’s little doubt it’s your most personal device hardly leaves your side. You’re not alone. A w study from 2015 pointed to how much the smartphone is central to most people’s lives in important ways, like looking up a medical condition, real estate listings, or a job search. l those messaging apps hy tools from make your phone the ideal companion. And as trendy cool as going on a “digital detox” may be, it’s just not practical. The right path is to go for the middle road. There are smart ways to curtail your use that won’t mean disconnecting from the people events that are important in your life. Here are some tips to get you started.\nStep one: get information I’ve had the most help with this by tapping into Android’s tools third-party apps to tell me exactly how much time I’m spending on my phone. A quote attributed to F. Drucker is helpful in this regard: “at’s measured improves.” One place to start is an area you may not expect: the battery. Android’s system is designed to tell you which apps system resources are draining away the juice the most. However, it’s also a good measure of which apps you’re spending the majority of your time with. If certain applications are at the top, it could be a sign that this is the first place to cut back. Another tool is to use a third-party app. One such option is Qualitye, which tracks which apps you use allows you to schedule “breaks” that make your phone mostly inoperable (you can undo if something important arises). I’ve found you get some good information here, so if an app like Twitter or a particular game sticks out, that may serve a sign that you may need to dial it back. There are other options in this category like Addicted one Usage Tracker. But even though Qualitye is a little overdue for an update, I still find it to be the most powerful.\nUnderst do not disturb I’ve long used the do not disturb feature as something to turn on when needed or off when it’s time for bed, a power nap, or other moments in the day when it’s best to be left alone. You can start a do not disturb session from the drop-down settings tile. The exact configuration may look a little different depending upon the specific interface of your phone. On Marshmallow Nougat, when you enable do not disturb you’ll see three specific options. There’s total silence, which as you can imagine will shut you off from the outside world. If you want a temporary reprieve, you can enable this until you decide to switch it off or for a set period of time. The arms Only setting is what you’d expect, with everything unable to bother you unless it’s an alarm. This is actually a good setting for a nap, so you won’t be interrupted by a call but you won’t sleep away half the day. Finally, iority Only is the most practical setting to use if you want to cut back on the notifications, but don’t want to be out of touch. There’s another way to use these capabilities to help you get disturbed even less. Touch hold the Do not disturb tile in the quick settings or head to Settings \u003e Set do not disturb schedule. There are multiple options for setting up a specific sessions of near silence. You can create different rules by day time, then apply the total silence, alarms only, or priority mode.\nDial things back The last piece of advice probably involves the most work. But in the end, crafting the ideal experience that won’t pester you is worth the effort. en it comes to apps that are going to eat away the most of your time, some of the culprits are usually in the realm of social media. Twitter alone has a considerable number of choices for whether you want to be highlighted by tweets, mentions, news, recommendations, more. You can just turn off notifications altogether, as long as this isn’t something you think you’re going to miss. Same goes for Facebook or any other social network you’re a part of—you’re going to need to dig into the settings specify what type of information you want to get pinged about. Another option is just to go dark with social media altogether. Really, are you getting that much out of arguing with friends on Facebook or seeing the latest tweets? The high-octane news cycle has certainly kept me hooked, but I’ve recognized that there are times I ought to take a break pick up a Kindle or at the very least engage my mind with a more analog task. A middle road could be to uninstall the apps, but sign to the web apps with Chrome. Using Facebook this way on mobile is particularly popular amongst the team, as it’ll not only pester you less but save you some battery life. us if the Facebook app isn’t right there on your home screen, you may be less likely to dive down that rabbit hole. Another notorious offender is eBay. By default, you get a notification for every single big on an item you’re selling. This gets annoying fast. And don’t even get me started on games. y too many mobile games will pester you by default after you’ve installed them played a few rounds. The bottom line, however, is that dialing back on your smartphone use is a combination of analyzing your own use, trimming notifications, applying some willpower. There’s a lot of fake science out there claiming that your phone is destroying your brain. But we could probably all benefit from some time off the firehose of social media or getting lost in a maze of meerkat videos.\n","wordCount":"1515","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Scott Dunnagan"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-reduce-your-smartphone-use-without-missing-out1026249/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Discover the Secret to Cutting Your Phone Addiction in Half While Still Being in the Loop!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 17, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1515 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Scott Dunnagan</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#step-one-get-information>Step one: get information</a></li><li><a href=#underst-do-not-disturb>Underst do not disturb</a></li><li><a href=#dial-things-back>Dial things back</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=discover-the-secret-to-cutting-your-phone-addiction-in-half-while-still-being-in-the-loop>Discover the Secret to Cutting Your Phone Addiction in Half While Still Being in the Loop!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#discover-the-secret-to-cutting-your-phone-addiction-in-half-while-still-being-in-the-loop>#</a></h1><p>Are you tired of feeling like your phone is taking over your life?
