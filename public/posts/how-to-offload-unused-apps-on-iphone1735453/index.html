We use them for communication, entertainment, business, and so much more. New apps are developed every day, and we can’t seem to get enough of them. However, the more apps we install, the more space they take up on our iPhones. This often leads to storage issues and a slow-performing device. In this article, we reveal the shocking truth about iPhone apps taking up precious space and how to instantly offload them.\nThe truth is, most iPhone users have less storage space than they think they do. The amount of space on an iPhone is no longer solely determined by its capacity but also by the number of apps and files taking up space. According to several studies, the average iPhone user has around 80 apps installed on their device. That’s a lot of apps! And with time, many of these apps become redundant, outdated, or simply irrelevant.\nThe problem with having too many apps on your iPhone is that they take up space, and storage space is a valuable resource. If your phone is consistently running out of storage space, it can cause your device to slow down, glitch, or even crash. Moreover, having too many apps can impact your iPhone’s battery life, as some apps use battery power even when they’re not in use.\nThe good news is that there’s a simple and effective solution to this problem – offloading apps. Offloading an app means removing the app from your device but keeping its data and settings so that you can reinstall it later if needed. This feature is available in iOS 11 or later and can be accessed by going to Settings \u003e General \u003e iPhone Storage. You can then select the app you want to offload and tap “Offload App.” This will remove the app from your device but keep its data and settings intact.\nAnother benefit of offloading apps is that it can free up significant amounts of space on your device. When you offload an app, it removes the app itself but not its data. For example, if you offload a game, you’ll free up space used by the actual game app, but your high scores and progress will be saved in iCloud. This means that you can always reinstall the app in the future and pick up right where you left off.\nIn conclusion, iPhone apps taking up precious space is a harsh reality that all users need to face. If left unchecked, this can lead to slow performance, battery drain, and other issues. By offloading apps, you can free up significant amounts of space on your device while keeping your data and settings intact. So, take a few minutes to go through your apps and offload those that are no longer needed. It’s an easy and effective way to keep your device running smoothly and avoid storage-related headaches.\nThis article explains how to use the Offload Unused Apps feature on iPhones running iOS 11 and later and how you can use it to avoid the Storage Almost Full alert.\nWhat to Know\nTo automatically offload apps, go to Settings \u003e App Store \u003e Offload Unused Apps.To manually offload apps, go to Settings \u003e General \u003e iPhone Storage \u003e Offload Unused Apps.To reinstall the offloaded app, tap on the app icon to download it again.
