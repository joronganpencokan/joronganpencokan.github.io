Do you want to spice things up and customize your computer even more? Look no further than turning your webcam into a motion sensor!\nWith the help of some simple software, you can easily transform your webcam into a highly sensitive motion sensor. This not only adds a cool new feature to your computer, but it can also increase your security by allowing you to monitor any movement in your workspace.\nFirstly, you will need the necessary software to detect motion. There are various options available online, both free and paid, so choose one that suits your needs and budget. Some popular options include iSpy, Yawcam, and Blue Iris.\nAfter downloading and installing the software, connect your webcam to your computer and ensure it is working properly. Then, open the software and configure its settings to suit your preferences. This may include adjusting the sensitivity of the motion sensor, setting up notifications when movement is detected, and selecting the area of your workspace that you want the sensor to capture.\nOnce you have set up your motion sensor, it’s time to customize your screen saver. You can now select a screensaver that responds to movement detected by your webcam. This means that instead of a static display, your screensaver will now come to life when it detects movement in front of your computer.\nThere are various motion-sensitive screensavers available online, from interactive games and animations to beautiful nature and art displays. One popular option is the “Webcam Toy” screensaver, which uses your webcam to create kaleidoscope-like images that move and react to your movements.\nBy revolutionizing your screen saver game and turning your webcam into a motion sensor, you can enjoy a unique and interactive display on your computer. Plus, with the added security feature of a motion sensor, you can have peace of mind knowing that you can monitor any movement in your workspace.\nSo why settle for a boring screen saver when you can create an immersive, personalized experience? Grab your webcam, download some motion detection software, and start exploring the many options available to enhance your computer’s display.\nChances are that you’re annoyed, at least to some degree, by the fact that you have to move your mouse or press a button on your keyboard to get rid of a screen saver on your computer. When screen savers are killed, it takes some time until your desktop shows, even on a mid-range system that functions decently. This annoying little thing would be so much less annoying if only you could program your webcam somehow to spot when there’s movement and then just turn off the screen saver, right? Let’s have a look!\nLet’s start by installing YawCam, an application that lets you have more control over your webcam and do some really cool stuff to it – like turning it into a motion sensor. Once we’re done with that, let’s proceed onwards:\nStart up YawCam (I assume you have already downloaded and installed it). This is how everything should start:\nIf you see a screen that tells you to select a device, go to “Settings -\u003e Detect Webcam.”\nGo to “Window -\u003e Motion Detection.” Here, you see a preview of what the camera detects. Motion detection can be a bit slow, so you need to make big movements that aren’t so sudden for them to register. When motion detection is enabled, you’ll even see a log of when the program registers motion.\nClick the “Actions” tab. Deselect “Play Sound” if you find that annoying.\nClick on the “Settings” tab. You can set the “tolerance” for the camera there to a lower level if you feel like you need it to be more reactive. The blue line under the preview is the tolerance threshold. The line above it is how much movement it sees. Got it?\nOpen up Notepad and write the following code in it, but don’t save yet:\nOnce you finish writing the code, save it as a “.wsf” file. You can do this by clicking “File -\u003e Save As…” and selecting “All Files” under the file type drop-down list. This code tells the computer to press “Enter.” Name it anything you want, but be sure to attach “.wsf” to the end of it, telling Windows that it’s a script.\nGo back to YawCam and get back to that “Actions” tab.\nSelect “Run .exe” and click “Settings.” In the text field, type the path where your “.wsf” file is found. Also click “Activate” under “Flood Control” to make sure you won’t run this action a ton of times when the camera detects motion.\nNow, whenever you need to walk away, enable the motion sensor. Disable it when you’re back. You’ll now have one of those sci-fi computers that know when you’re present. This kind of trick is mainly intended to make you feel cool about having a high-tech solution to something, but it’s more like a Rube Goldberg machine. If you have any cooler solutions to this, hit us up in the comments section! We’d love to hear what you have to say!\nMiguel has been a business growth and technology expert for more than a decade and has written software for even longer. From his little castle in Romania, he presents cold and analytical perspectives to things that affect the tech world.\nOur latest tutorials delivered straight to your inbox\n","wordCount":"916","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-16T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-16T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lori Jackson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-make-your-computer-s-screen-saver-motion-sensitive-with-your-webcam1008807/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionize Your Screen Saver Game: Turn Your Webcam Into A Motion Sensor!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-16 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 16, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;916 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Lori Jackson</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Revolutionize Your Screen Saver Game: Turn Your Webcam Into A Motion Sensor!</p><p>Are you tired of your old, boring screen saver?
