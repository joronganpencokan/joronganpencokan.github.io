Smartphones are an integral part of our lives, and we use them for a variety of purposes, ranging from communication to entertainment. However, one of the most crucial aspects of using a smartphone is controlling its brightness, especially in low-light conditions. While most phones have a dedicated brightness slider or a quick setting toggle, accessing them can be a hassle and time-consuming. That’s where this revolutionary hack comes in - it lets you control your phone’s brightness with just a swipe on the status bar!\nThe Problem Before we delve into the solution, let’s first understand the problem with the current approach. When you need to adjust your phone’s brightness, you either have to go to the settings menu or pull down the notification shade and find the brightness slider or toggle. Depending on your phone’s UI, the steps may vary, but they all involve multiple taps and swipes. This can be inconvenient, especially when you need to adjust the brightness frequently, such as when you move from a dark room to a bright outdoors or vice versa. Moreover, it can take your focus away from the task at hand, leading to distractions and decreased productivity.\nThe Solution Luckily, the solution to this problem is simple, effective, and versatile - and it’s available on most Android phones running version 7 or above. All you need to do is enable a hidden feature called “Brightness Control,” which adds a brightness slider to the quick settings panel, accessible by swiping down the status bar twice.\nHere’s how to do it:\nSwipe down the status bar twice with two fingers to expand the quick settings panel. Tap the edit icon (pencil) in the bottom right corner to enter the customization mode. Scroll down to find the “Brightness Control” tile and drag it to the top row. Tap the back button or swipe up to exit the customization mode. That’s it! Now, whenever you need to adjust your phone’s brightness, simply swipe down twice and drag the brightness slider to your desired level. You can also long-press the tile to access additional options, such as auto-brightness, reading mode, and color enhancement, depending on your phone’s capabilities.\nThe Benefits By using this hack, you can enjoy several benefits over the traditional approach:\nConvenience: You can now adjust your phone’s brightness with just a few swipes, saving you time and effort. Efficiency: You can stay focused on your tasks without getting distracted by complex menus or settings. Customization: You can customize the quick settings panel to include only the tiles you need, making it more tailored to your preferences. Accessibility: You can access the brightness slider from anywhere, even when you’re using full-screen apps or games, without interrupting your flow. The Caveats While this hack is straightforward and useful, there are a few caveats to keep in mind:\nCompatibility: This hack only works on Android phones running version 7 (Nougat) or above. If your phone is running an older version, you may not have this feature. Customizations: Depending on your phone’s UI, the customization steps or options may differ. Some phones may have the brightness control tile enabled by default, while others may require enabling it manually. Battery life: Using high brightness levels can drain your phone’s battery faster, so it’s essential to balance the brightness with the power-saving mode and other optimizations. Conclusion In conclusion, controlling your phone’s brightness with just a swipe on the status bar is a revolutionary hack that can save you time, effort, and distractions. By following the simple steps outlined above, you can enable this feature on your phone and enjoy the benefits of a more convenient and efficient user experience. However, as with any hack, it’s crucial to use it responsibly and considerately, keeping in mind the possible caveats and side-effects. Happy swiping!\nDuring the reign of CyanogenMod, Android modding enthusiasts would get all kinds of innovative features. In fact, they were so innovative and useful that even the big players like Google and Samsung would copy them. One of such feature was the ability to gesture control screen brightness, which is still not adopted into today’s stock Android. This was first introduced on CyanogenMod 13. Fortunately, a talented developer named Tom Bayley worked hard and developed an app that can add this feature on any Android without needing root access. Here’s how to control screen brightness with a swipe on status bar.\nControl Screen Brightness with a Swipe on Status Bar There was a time when rooting and flashing was at its peak. CyanogenMod 13 and a handful of other ROMs had this feature. Thanks to the developer Tom Bayley, we can now get this feature on any Android without even rooting. Follow the steps below.\nStep 1: Install Super Status Bar The app that allows us to do so is called Super Status Bar and it is available for free on the Google Play Store. This app isn’t just for adding this particular feature; it has galore of other essential and innovative features that you might be interested in. If you want to unlock all the feature, you can do that for the low price of $1.99\nGet Super Status Bar from the Google Play Store.\nStep 2: Permissions Open the app after it is installed and go through the initial setup screens. Then, Tap on Start. You will find 2 toggles which need to be enabled. Tapping on each of the toggles will take you to the Settings page where you need to enable the permission for the app. Do that for each of the toggles and you’re done. you might need to find Super Status Bar from the list of apps if the permission is being allowed to tons of apps. Nevertheless, it would not be difficult to do that.\nGet back to the main screen. You will notice that the Start button you’ve previously pressed has turned into a Stop button. This indicated that the app and its services are currently running and you’re ready to use its features.\nStep 3: Add Slider The app has two options to manage the slider – Indicators and Main Slider. However, if you have the free version, you can only use Indicators. That is why it is wise to opt for the pro version.\nIndicators will let you modify the icon that appears when you activate the gesture. If you have the free version, you can only change the Style to rounded and rectangle. Pro version has tons of other styles. Play around and customize as per your preference.\nStep 4: Use Gesture After you’re done customizing, you’re ready to use it. All you have to do is place your finger on the top portion of the status bar and slide it from left to right. You will see the indicator and the new brightness level as you swipe your finger across the status bar. Lift the finger when you get the desired brightness level. That’s how easy it is. Note that using this feature will turn the adaptive brightness off.\nTAGSAndroidAndroid AppsAndroid How toAndroid Tipshow to android tricks How to Fix Samsung Galaxy S22 Overheating?
