These instructions apply to Microsoft Excel 2019 and 2016 as well as Excel in Office 365.\nWhat to Know\nThe easiest way to move a column in Excel is to highlight it, press Shift, and drag it to the new location.You can also use cut \u0026 paste or do Data Sort to rearrange columns from the Data tab.Columns that are part of a merged group of cells will not move. Move Columns Using Your Mouse There are several ways to rearrange the columns in an Excel worksheet, but one is easier than all the others. It just takes a highlight and a drag-and-drop motion. Here’s how to move columns in Excel using your mouse.\nIn the worksheet where you want to rearrange columns, place your cursor over the top of the column you want to move. You should see your cursor change to an arrow. When it does, click to highlight the column. Next, press and hold the Shift key on the keyboard and then click and hold on the right or left border of the column you want to move and drag it to the right or left. As you drag your cursor across the columns, you’ll see the borders darken to indicate where the new column will appear. When you’re happy with the location, release the mouse click. You column will be moved to the location indicated by the darker border.

This works much as you would expect it.\nIn the worksheet where you want to rearrange columns, place your cursor over the top of the column you want to move. You should see your cursor change to an arrow. When it does, click to highlight the column.\nNext, press and hold the Shift key on the keyboard and then click and hold on the right or left border of the column you want to move and drag it to the right or left.\nAs you drag your cursor across the columns, you’ll see the borders darken to indicate where the new column will appear. When you’re happy with the location, release the mouse click.\nYou column will be moved to the location indicated by the darker border.\nHighlight the column you want to move, and then press Ctrl + X on your keyboard to cut the column from its current location. You’ll see the “marching ants” around the column to indicate it has been cut from its current location. Next, highlight a column to the right of where you want to move the cut column to, and right-click. In the menu, select Insert Cut Cells. The new column is inserted to the left of the selected column. Move Columns Using a Data Sort Moving columns with a data sort is probably not the easiest way to move things around if you only have one or two columns that need to be moved, but if you have a large spreadsheet and you want to change the order of numerous columns, this little trick could be a major time saver.\nHighlight the column you want to move, and then press Ctrl + X on your keyboard to cut the column from its current location. You’ll see the “marching ants” around the column to indicate it has been cut from its current location.\nNext, highlight a column to the right of where you want to move the cut column to, and right-click. In the menu, select Insert Cut Cells.\nThe new column is inserted to the left of the selected column.\nTo start, you need to add a row to the very top of your spreadsheet. To do this, right-click the first row and select Insert from the context menu. A new row is inserted above your top row.
