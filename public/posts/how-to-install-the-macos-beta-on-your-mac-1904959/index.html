If you are looking to unlock some of the secret features on your Mac, then installing the MacOS beta might be worth considering. Apple releases beta versions of their MacOS operating system to the public to test out new features and functions before they are officially launched.\nIn this article, we will be exploring how to install the MacOS beta, and what benefits you can expect.\nWhat is a MacOS Beta? A MacOS beta is an early version of the operating system that is still in development. It is released by Apple to the public to test out new features and functions, and to gather feedback before the official launch.\nBeta testers are able to access features that are not available on the current version of MacOS, and they can provide valuable feedback that helps to shape the final product.\nHow to Install the MacOS Beta To install the MacOS beta, you will need to follow these steps:\nBack up your data - Before installing any new software, it is important to back up your data. This will ensure that your files and documents are safe in case something goes wrong during the installation process. Check compatibility - Make sure your Mac is compatible with the latest beta version of MacOS. You can check this by visiting Apple’s website and reviewing the system requirements. Join the Apple Beta Software Program - Go to the Apple Beta Software Program website and sign up using your Apple ID. Follow the instructions to download the MacOS beta installer. Install the beta - Once you have downloaded the installer, run it and follow the instructions to install the beta version of MacOS. Benefits of Installing the MacOS Beta By installing the MacOS beta, you will gain access to new features that are not available on the current version of MacOS. Some of these features might include improved performance, enhanced security measures, and new applications.\nBeta testers can also provide valuable feedback to Apple, helping to shape the final version of MacOS. This feedback can lead to improvements in usability, bug fixes, and other enhancements that make MacOS even better.\nPotential Risks of Installing the MacOS Beta As with any beta software, there are some risks associated with installing the MacOS beta. Some of these risks include:\nBugs and glitches - Beta software is still in development, and there may be bugs and glitches that need to be ironed out. This can cause software crashes, data loss, and other issues. Compatibility issues - Some software applications may not be compatible with the beta version of MacOS, leading to problems with installation or operation. Security risks - Since beta software is still in development, it may not have the same level of security as a fully released version of MacOS. This can put your data at risk. Conclusion If you are looking to unlock some of the secret features on your Mac, installing the MacOS beta might be worth considering. However, it is important to back up your data and be aware of the potential risks before doing so.\nBy following the steps outlined in this article, you can install the latest beta version of MacOS and gain access to new features and functions that are not yet available on the current version of MacOS.\nApple usually brings a new macOS version every fall, a few months after announcing its release. If you are too eager and cannot wait for the final version, then you can install the beta version and enjoy the upcoming features much sooner. This guide shows you how to install a macOS beta on your Mac and the risks involved in doing so.\nHow to Install macOS Beta With an Apple Developer Account There are two beta versions of macOS that you can install: developer beta and public beta. The developer beta gets updated more frequently, whereas the public beta is relatively more stable.\nThe developer beta may include many features that the public beta is yet to get, as the beta version is first released to developers, who give feedback and help stabilize it. Once increasingly stable versions are achieved, they are released as public beta versions. However, for the developer beta, you need to enroll in the Apple Developer Program, which costs $99/year.\nOnce you’re an Apple Developer, you can follow the steps below to install the latest developer beta.\nHead to the Apple Developer website.\nClick “Account” in the top-right corner of the screen.\nSign in with your Developer account.\nHead to the “Downloads” section in the left sidebar.\nScroll down to the beta version and click “Install Profile.”\nNavigate to the download location, then double-click the .dmg file.\nInside the utility, double-click the “macOSDeveloperBetaAccessUtility.pkg” file.\nClick “Continue” in the new window.\nRead the Software License Agreement and again click “Continue,” then click “Agree” in the pop-up window that appears.\nSelect the destination and installation type, then click “Install.”\nEnter your password when prompted and click “Install Software.”\nAfter the installation finishes, click “Upgrade Now” in “System Preferences -\u003e Software Update” to upgrade to the latest beta version of macOS. (You can also update your Mac using Terminal.)\nWait for your Mac to restart. Once you’re on the Lock Screen, enter the passcode to sign in.\nAgain, wait while the macOS beta is being installed on your Mac and sign in with your password or Touch ID.\nIn the Analytics window, click “Continue” and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your Mac.\nThe Feedback Assistant window will open, and you can close it to start enjoying the new features of macOS before they’re officially released.\nHow to Join the macOS Public Beta Program If you’re not a developer or don’t want to drop $99 bucks every year, then you can install the macOS public beta for free with the steps below.\nHead to the Apple Beta Software Program website.\nClick “Sign In” and sign in with your Apple ID.\nSign in to the Apple Beta Software Program with your Apple ID.\nIn the “Guide for Public Betas,” click “macOS,” followed by “enroll your Mac” under the “Get Started” section.\nClick “Download the macOS Public Beta Access Utility.”\nNavigate to the download location and double-click the .dmg file.\nInside the utility, double-click the “macOSPublicBetaAccessUtility.pkg” file.\nRead the “Software License Agreement” and again click “Continue,” then click “Agree” in the pop-up window that appears.\nOnce the installation is finished, upgrade to the macOS beta from “System Preferences -\u003e Software Update.”\nOnce you click “Upgrade Now”, your Mac will restart. On the Lock Screen, sign in with the passcode to finish installing the macOS beta, then click “Continue” on the “Analytics” window and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your Mac.\nNow you can enjoy the latest features of the upcoming macOS version!\nIs It Safe to Install the macOS Beta? While it’s safe to install a macOS beta on your Mac, it may not be a smooth ride, and you need to be cautious. For starters, you should never install any beta version of macOS on your primary Mac – even Apple does not recommend it, as the beta version is a work in progress and is bound to have issues. Installing macOS beta on your primary Mac can disrupt your workflow and even cause data loss.\nBugs, Security, and Stability Issues Be prepared to face bugs and stability issues. Since developers are still working on the beta version, your battery may drain faster, or many apps may freeze when you’re using them. Your Mac may not even perform as well as it used to. Also, beta versions of all operating systems are playgrounds for hackers. They will dig up any security flaws to exploit vulnerabilities. Usually, Apple releases security patches as soon as any irregularity is discovered, but using the beta version still poses a security threat.\nSome Apps May Not Work Since the new macOS comes with many new features, many apps may not be optimized to run alongside them. The stock apps will obviously run without any issues, but third-party developers have to optimize their software for the new macOS.\nOne thing that you should keep in mind is that you must back up your entire Mac before installing a macOS beta. This way, if you want to revert to the previous macOS version in the future, you will not lose your data.\nFrequently Asked Questions Image credit: Unsplash. All screenshots by Hashir Ibrahim.\nDo beta users get the final version earlier? No, but there is also no need to downgrade to the previous stable version macOS or uninstall the beta version before upgrading to the final build.\nOnce the final version of macOS is released publicly, beta users can upgrade to it by heading to “System Preferences -\u003e Software Update.” Apple is known to provide long-term software support, so even if you have a five-year-old Mac, it could be capable of running the latest macOS version.\nIf you run into trouble with the process, you’ll need to know how to fix a frozen Mac during an update.\nHow can I report a bug to Apple? If you’ve come across a bug in the macOS beta, you can report it directly to Apple using the Feedback Assistant app. Open the app, select the area where you’re facing the bug, then describe the bug in a single sentence.\nYou also have the option to get into the specifics and include the steps to reproduce the bug. There is also an option to attach files for further information. Click “Allow” when the Feedback Assistant app asks for permission to collect and send diagnostic information to Apple.\nWith over two years of in-depth experience working in technical fields, Hashir is a master content creator who loves writing about Mac and iOS at major tech publications on the internet like MakeUseOf and MakeTechEasier.
