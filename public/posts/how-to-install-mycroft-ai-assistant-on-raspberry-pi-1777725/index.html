It’s not too hard to envision a near future where just about every home has its own AI assistant.\nWhat if you don’t want a huge corporation having a direct line into your home? Maybe you want to build your own to understand how they work? Mycroft is the solution. Mycroft is an open-source AI assistant that aims to compete with the likes of Alexa and Google. No, Mycroft isn’t entirely there yet, but the project is still in active development.\nMycroft is based on the hugely popular Raspberry Pi, so you can actually set up your own with a Pi and test it out.\nWhat You’ll Need If you want to use all of Mycroft’s functionality, you’ll need a a few things for your setup.\nMicroSD card with Mycroft Raspberry Pi 3 Micro USB power cable for the Pi USB speaker (or combo USB speaker/microphone) USB Microphone Get the Image Mycroft provides an image read for you to install on your Raspberry Pi. You can download the image here. If something changes, and that link no longer works, check the download page.\nInstall Etcher Etcher is an excellent program for writing images to your MicroSD card. Head over to Etcher.io and install the version for your computer’s operating system. It has a fairly basic installer, so there’s not much to worry about. Just follow the provided instructions.\nCreate Your Card Insert your MicroSD card into your computer’s reader and launch Etcher. The utility has a super simple interface. First, select the file that you want to write to your card. Then, select the location of your card on the computer. When you’re absolutely certain that both are correct, write to your card. It’ll take a few minutes, but Etcher will prompt you when it finishes.\nCreate a Mycroft Account Mycroft has an accounts system so you can keep track of devices and get more accurate information. This is an open-source project, not an advertising platform. Before you put your Pi together, set up your account.\nSet Up Your Pi When the card is finished writing, remove it from your computer and insert it into the Raspberry Pi. Connect the speaker and microphone to the Pi. Finally, plug your Rasbperry Pi in. Mycroft will start up.\nBoot and Try It Mycroft will start up immediately and start talking to you. It will give you a six-digit code for you to link your device to your Mycroft account. It will also tell you exactly where to enter in your code.\nOnce your Mycroft is linked, it’ll run through some more setup by itself. After it’s done, you can start trying out the built-in commands that it has. Mycroft commands are called “Skills.” The list of skills is ever-growing, so refer to the reference on the project Github. There are community-created skills available, too, if you get bored.\nThat’s it! Remember that Mycroft is still under very active development, so some things might change, and there still may be bugs. If you like Mycroft, you can contribute to the project or even write your own skills.\nNick is a freelance tech. journalist, Linux enthusiast, and a long time PC gamer.\nOur latest tutorials delivered straight to your inbox\n","wordCount":"1168","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lisette Kocur"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-install-mycroft-ai-assistant-on-raspberry-pi-1777725/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock the Power of Your Raspberry Pi with Mycroft AI Assistant - Learn How to Install it Now!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 17, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1168 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Lisette Kocur</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#what-youll-need>What You’ll Need</a></li><li><a href=#get-the-image>Get the Image</a></li><li><a href=#install-etcher>Install Etcher</a></li><li><a href=#create-your-card>Create Your Card</a></li><li><a href=#create-a-mycroft-account>Create a Mycroft Account</a></li><li><a href=#set-up-your-pi>Set Up Your Pi</a></li><li><a href=#boot-and-try-it>Boot and Try It</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Introduction:</p><p>The Raspberry Pi is a great single-board computer that has revolutionized the computing world with its low-cost design and versatility.
