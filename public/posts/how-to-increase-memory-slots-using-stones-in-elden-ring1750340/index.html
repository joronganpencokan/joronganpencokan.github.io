In this article, we’ll introduce you to some surprising stone hacks that will help you unlock the hidden ability to upgrade your memory slots in Elden Ring.\nBut first, let us understand what memory slots are and why they are crucial in Elden Ring.

The Black Stone is a powerful tool that can be a game-changer in battles.\nSilverstone Silverstone is another rare item in Elden Ring, but it’s effective for upgrading memory slots.

Silverstone is a precious resource, and it’s advisable to use it in boss battles or situations where you need more memory slots quickly.\nCrystal Stone The Crystal Stone has a different effect from the Black and Silverstone. When used in Elden Ring, the Crystal Stone increases your character’s maximum memory slots. This stone is useful for players who want to upgrade their character’s memory slots permanently. The Crystal Stone increases your character’s maximum memory slots by one for every ten levels gained, and it ensures that you have a substantial memory slot capacity in the long run.\nRed Stone Red Stone is an interesting item in Elden Ring as it has a unique effect on your character’s memory slots. When used, Red Stone converts uses one of your character’s memory slots to regenerate health. It’s not as valuable as the previous stones but can be useful if you’re in desperate need of health regeneration.\nIn conclusion, these surprising stone hacks are a game-changer for upgrading your memory slots in Elden Ring. The Black Stone, Silverstone, Crystal Stone, and Red Stone are valuable resources that should be used strategically depending on your playstyle.

So, go ahead and explore the game’s vast map to discover these valuable stones!\nWhile playing as a Prophet or Astrologer in Elden Ring, you will want to increase your Memory slots. This is because these slots are needed for memorizing your Incantations or Sorceries in the game. But like many other mechanics, the game doesn’t tell you how you can increase them. So in this guide check out how to increase memory slots in Elden Ring, and also learn how to get memory stones and the Moon of Nokstella talisman.\nHow to Increase Memory Slots in Elden Ring You can increase Memory Slots in Elden Ring using Memory Stones and Moon of Nokstella. When you start the game you have only 2 Memory slots but, as you get more Memory Stones your slots increase. There are 8 of these that you can find in The Lands Between. To increase your Memory slots even further you can even equip the Moon of Nokstella Talisman. This further boosts your Memory slots by 2. So you can have a maximum of 12 memory slots in Elden Ring after having the Talisman equipped, and 10 without it.\nThere are 3 methods to acquire these stones, getting them from boss fights, buying one from Twin Maiden sister, and mostly getting them from chests. Here is the location for each Memory stone and how you can get Moon of Nokstella:\nAll Memory Stone locations in Elden Ring After getting the stones you don’t have to use or equip them manually. They automatically increase your Memory slots.\nRed Wolf of Radagon: You can find it at Raya Lucaria Academy. It drops 1 Memory Stone upon defeat.\nDemi-Human Queen Maggie: You can find her at the Hermit Village. She drops 1 Memory Stone upon defeat.\nTwin Maiden Husks sell 1 Memory Stone for 3,000 Runes at Roundtable Hold.\nClimb these towers and you will find a chest on top. The chest will contain 1 Memory Stone.\nOridys’s Rise\nConverted Tower\nTestu’s Rise\nSeluvis’s Rise\nLenne’s Rise\nOridys’s Rise\nConverted Tower\nTestu’s Rise\nSeluvis’s Rise\nLenne’s Rise\nHow to Get Moon of Nokstella You can find the Moon of Nokstella Talisman in Nokstella, Eternal City.\nFast travel to the Nokstella, Eternal City site of grace. Go west and climb up the stairs. Keep climbing up and once on top turn right. You should be going north. Dodge the large boulder rolling down the stairs. Climb up the flight of stairs this boulder rolled down from. Turn right and go inside this area. When you reach its end three mimic tears will fall from the top. Dodge them and go left.
