As you try to map out your journey, you play the guessing game on the road and risk getting lost, making your traveling experience less enjoyable. The good news is that you no longer have to rely on guesswork or follow predetermined routes. With Google Maps, you can create custom routes that meet your unique traveling needs.\nGoogle Maps is a powerful tool designed to help users navigate their way to their destination. The app offers real-time traffic updates, satellite imagery, and street view options, amongst other features, to make traveling a breeze. However, what many people don’t know is that there are several ways to customize journeys using Google Maps, which can help to optimize travel time and enhance the overall experience. Here are some of the steps that you can take to revolutionize your travel plans with Google Maps.\nUse the “Add Stop” Feature: The “Add stop” feature is an effective way to create a multi-stop route by adding pit stops or sightseeing saves. This feature allows you to plan your journey on your terms, ensuring that you visit all essential landmarks or other significant points of interest along the way. To use the “Add stop” feature, simply click on any point on your route that you’d like to include as a pit stop, and click on “Add stop” to include it in your route.\nDrag and Drop to Customize the Route: Another way to revolutionize your travel experience with Google Maps is by using the “Drag and drop” feature. It allows you to customize the journey by drawing your route and moving the map’s blue dot on your intended path. This feature is incredibly useful when you want to avoid certain routes or take scenic ones. You can also adjust the route by clicking and dragging the blue route’s line to the desired path.\nUse Different Modes of Transport: Google Maps also provides various modes of transportation. Traveling on different vehicles varies, so picking the right method can impact the overall traveling experience. You can set a preferred method of transportation that includes walking, cycling, car, bus, or even train. This feature comes in handy when traveling in busy areas or when you want to take public transportation to your destination.\nSave and Share the Route: Lastly, Google Maps allows you to save and share your route with friends or family. You can either send the map’s URL or create a custom link to share your route. This feature ensures that you can share your custom route experience with others to add to their travel experience.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, Google Maps is a powerful tool that revolutionizes how people travel. You can customize a journey in several ways, including adding stops or optimizing the route, choosing a preferred mode of transportation, and sharing the route with friends or family.
