If you enjoy exploring and mining in the dark in Minecraft, then you know how essential having a good light source is. Torches, lanterns, and glowstone are all great options, but what if we told you there was a potion that could give you night vision? That’s right, with a few simple ingredients, you can make your very own Night Vision Potion and unleash your inner wizard in Minecraft!\nWhat you’ll need Nether wart Golden carrot Water bottle Blaze powder Step by Step Guide First, you’ll need to find some nether wart. You can find nether wart growing in soul sand in the Nether. Break the soul sand block to collect the nether wart.\nNext, you’ll need to craft a brewing stand. To do this, you’ll need to gather three cobblestones and one blaze rod. Combine the three cobblestones in a V-shape in your crafting table, leaving the top-middle box empty. Add the blaze rod to the center box to complete the brewing stand.\nPlace your brewing stand on the ground and fill it with water bottles. You’ll need to fill at least one bottle with water.\nAdd the nether wart to the top slot of the brewing stand to create an awkward potion. This will require one nether wart per bottle of water.\nNow it’s time to add the golden carrot. To do this, you’ll need to craft a golden carrot by combining one gold nugget and one carrot in your crafting table. Once you have a golden carrot, add it to the top slot of the brewing stand.\nWait for the awkward potion to turn into a night vision potion. This will take a few moments, during which you may see some bubbles appear in the brewing stand. If you want to speed up the process, you can add blaze powder to the brewing stand by putting it in the bottom slot of the stand.\nOnce the night vision potion is complete, you can pour it into your inventory by clicking on the potion bottle.\nFinally, drink the night vision potion by selecting it in your hotbar and right-clicking. You’ll now have night vision for eight minutes, allowing you to explore and mine in the darkness without any problems.\nCongratulations! You’ve just unleashed your inner wizard and created your very own night vision potion in Minecraft. Now you can explore and mine to your heart’s content in the darkness or even use it during a PvP battle to gain the upper hand. So go forth and put your newfound knowledge to use in the world of Minecraft!\nMinecraft is an amazing game where a player can do whatever they want. Aside from the Mining \u0026 Crafting items, players can enjoy the PvE experience, raid a generated structure, etc. Whatever they do, they will need help other than what their Armor and Weapons can provide. In Minecraft, you can brew a Potion that can provide a buff or debuff for a short period. The effects can be Strength, Fire Resistance, Regeneration, Slowness, Poison, etc. What about a potion that allows us to see in the dark? Well, there is a Potion like that in Minecraft and it is the Potion of Night Vision. In today’s guide, I will show you how to make a Potion of Night Vision in Minecraft.\nHow to Make a Potion of Night Vision in Minecraft To make a Potion of Night Vision, you will need to satisfy a few prerequisites. You will need a Brewing Stand which is craftable with a Blaze Rod in the middle of the Crafting table and a row of Cobblestone, Cobbled Deepslate, or Blackstone under it. You will also need a Blaze Rod to make Blaze Powder which will be the Fuel Source for the Brewing Stand. After that, you will need Glass Bottles which can be made by making a V shape with 3 Glass Blocks in the Crafting table. After that, fill them with water. The best way of doing this is by having an Infinite Water Source or a Water-logged Block nearby. Now that you have all of the prerequisites, here is how you can brew a Potion of Night Vision.\nIn the Brewing Stand, place the three Water Bottles as well as the Blaze Powder. The first Ingredient you will need to make a Potion of Night Vision in Minecraft is the Awkward Potion. To make it, you will need a Nether Wart that grows only in Nether Fortresses. Put in the Brewing Stand and you should have 3 Awkward Potions. Up next is the Potion of Night Vision itself, you will need to put a Golden Carrot in the Brewing Stand. To make a Golden Carrot, you will need to take a Carrot and surround it with 8 Gold Nuggets in the Crafting Table. Once it gets brewed into the Awkward Potion, your Potion of Night Vision will get ready. You can brew it with Redstone Dust to make it last longer and with Gunpowder to make it a Splash Potion respectively.\nThis was all about making a Potion of Night Vision in Minecraft. Hopefully, this guide has helped you.
