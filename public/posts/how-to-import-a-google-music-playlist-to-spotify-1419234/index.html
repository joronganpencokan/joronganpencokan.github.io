Did you recently switch from Google Music to Spotify and are wondering how to move your playlists? Well, you’re not alone. Many people face this problem when they switch to a new music streaming platform. But moving your playlist doesn’t have to be a hassle. In this article, we’ll show you three simple tricks to move your Google Music playlist to Spotify effortlessly.\nTrick #1: Use a Third-Party Service The first trick to move your Google Music playlist to Spotify is to use a third-party service. There are several websites and apps available that can help you transfer your playlist in just a few clicks. Some of the popular ones are TuneMyMusic, SongShift, Stamp, and MusConv.\nAll you need to do is select the playlists you want to transfer, choose Spotify as your target platform, and authorize the app to access your accounts. The transfer process usually takes a few minutes, depending on the number of songs in your playlist.\nTrick #2: Export Your Playlist as a CSV File If you don’t want to use a third-party service, you can still move your Google Music playlist to Spotify using a CSV file. Exporting your playlist as a CSV file is simple. All you need to do is follow these steps:\nLog in to your Google Music account and select the playlist you want to transfer. Click on the three dots icon in the top right corner and select “Export Playlist.” Choose the “CSV” option and click “Export.” Log in to your Spotify account and click on “File” followed by “Import Playlists.” Choose the CSV file you just exported and click “Import.” The process may take a few minutes, depending on the size of your playlist.\nTrick #3: Manually Re-Create Your Playlist If you only have a few songs in your playlist, the simplest way to transfer it is to manually re-create it on Spotify. While this may seem like a hassle, it’s the easiest and most straightforward solution.\nTo do this, open Spotify and create a new playlist. Search for the songs you want to add, select them, and drag them to your new playlist. Repeat this process until you have re-created your entire Google Music playlist on Spotify.\nIn Conclusion\nMoving your Google Music playlist to Spotify may seem like a daunting task, but it doesn’t have to be. By using a third-party service, exporting your playlist as a CSV file or manually re-creating your playlist, you can transfer your beloved music collection to your new streaming platform with ease. So, pick the trick that suits you best and get started!\nChoosing between music streaming services has always been a difficult decision to make. Most of the service providers allow you to try their software for free or for a portion of the original price for a certain period of time. Google Play Music offers a free trial of two months, while Spotify offers three months of premium service for the price of 0.99 EUR. Also, if you do not want to pay for such services, most of the companies allow you to listen to music with certain restrictions.\nHowever, when you try a certain service but would like to switch to another service provider, you don’t want to leave your files at the software you are leaving. To avoid such things from happening, you have to import your data from one service to another. Playlists are among the most precious user data.\nLet’s say you tried Google Play Music and would like to switch to Spotify but don’t want to leave your playlists behind. There are several methods you can use to import your data from Google’s service to Spotify. However, the easiest technique is to use a third-party app designed to import a Google Music playlist to Spotify.\n1. Stamp For those who do not want to pay anything for importing data from one music streaming service to another, Stamp is the best option. With a free subscription, Stamp allows you to transfer one playlist at a time from Google Play Music to Spotify. If you have many playlists, this could take much of your time, but it’s free! If you do not want to devote much time to transferring your music data, you can buy the software for one operating system for 8.99 EUR or for 12.99 EUR if you would like to use the bundle option (all OSs).\nDownload the app from Stamp’s website and install it to your device.\nAfter you are done, choose “Google Play Music” and log in to your account.\nOn the next screen, do the same for “Spotify.”\nYour next move should be to choose the playlist/playlists you would like to import from Google Music to Spotify, tick it/them and click “Next.” You have to wait for the app to perform the required tasks and should then be done.\n2. Soundiiz The upside of Soundiiz, compared to Stamp, is that you don’t have to download the application in order to use it. However, importing playlists from a streaming service to another will cost you money since it is a premium feature. However, it won’t cost you much since Soundiiz offers subscription plans starting at $3 per month.\nTo use this service you need to navigate to Soundiiz’s website.\nClick “Start Now” and sign up for a new account.\nOnce your account is created, you have to confirm your email address.\nAfter you complete that step, click “Platform to platform” on the top-right corner. From the music streaming service, choose Google Music,” log in to your account, and click “Google Music” again.\nFrom the list, choose the playlist/playlists you would like to import to Spotify, tick it/them and click “Confirm and continue.” You have to select “Spotify” as the destination. In the pop-up, add your login details and click Spotify again.\nWait for a little while, and your playlist(s) should be imported from Google Music to Spotify!\nConclusion For those who would like to transfer playlists from one music streaming service to another, but only on one occasion, I would recommend Soundiiz since you can cancel your subscription after the first month that had cost just $3. However, if you frequently transfer data between services, Stamp would be a better source, as you can purchase the software (no monthly payments) at a one-time fee of either 8.99 EUR or 12.99 EUR.\nBenjamin Vitáris is a freelance journalist and tech blogger.\nOur latest tutorials delivered straight to your inbox\n","wordCount":"1092","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ana Wiggins"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-import-a-google-music-playlist-to-spotify-1419234/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Here are 3 Simple Tricks to Move Your Google Music Playlist to Spotify without Hassles!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 17, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1092 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Ana Wiggins</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#trick-1-use-a-third-party-service>Trick #1: Use a Third-Party Service</a></li><li><a href=#trick-2-export-your-playlist-as-a-csv-file>Trick #2: Export Your Playlist as a CSV File</a></li><li><a href=#trick-3-manually-re-create-your-playlist>Trick #3: Manually Re-Create Your Playlist</a></li><li><a href=#1-stamp>1.
