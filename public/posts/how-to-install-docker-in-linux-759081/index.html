In Linux, Docker offers many benefits, including portability, scalability, and resource isolation. If you’re new to the Docker world or want to learn more about installing Docker on Linux, this guide offers the ultimate guide to mastering Docker installation in Linux.\nStep 1: Update your system\nBefore you install Docker, it’s essential to ensure that your system is up-to-date. To do this, run the commands below:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\nThis will update your system’s package list and install any available upgrades.\nStep 2: Install Docker\nThere are different ways to install Docker on Linux, including using the official Docker installer script, using the package manager, or building from source. In this guide, we will show you how to install Docker using the package manager.\nThe steps below show you how to install Docker on Ubuntu Linux distribution:\nsudo apt install docker.io\nWhen the installation is complete, you can verify that Docker is installed correctly by checking its version:\nsudo docker --version\nYou should see output similar to this:\nDocker version 20.10.7, build f0df350\nStep 3: Run Docker as a non-root user\nBy default, Docker requires root privileges to work correctly. However, running Docker as a root user poses a security risk. Therefore, it’s recommended to run Docker as a non-root user.\nTo do this, add your user to the Docker group:\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\nYou will need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.\nStep 4: Test Docker installation\nNow it’s time to test Docker installation to ensure that it’s working correctly. The easiest way to do this is to run the “hello-world” container, which is available on Docker Hub:\nsudo docker run hello-world\nThis will download a Docker image and run a container that prints out a message that confirms that Docker installation is working correctly.\nConclusion\nCongratulations! You have successfully installed Docker on your Linux system. Docker offers many possibilities for developers and system administrators, including the ability to create isolated environments for testing, to deploy applications to production, and to simplify the deployment process significantly. With this guide, you can now master the installation process of Docker in Linux and start exploring its many features.\nVirtualization and containers are continually rising in popularity. The reasons why they’re useful mostly revolve around the isolation, security and portability benefits they provide.\nFor example, if you’re offering some form of cloud services, they make it easier to keep customer data and services isolated from each other. But it’s not limited to these scenarios. If you are a developer of a Linux application, you will quickly realize how hard it is to make your app available to all Linux distributions.\nOnce you make your program work in Ubuntu, making it also function in Arch Linux, Debian and other distros won’t be as straightforward as you might think. Every distribution is different, and you have to make adaptations so that your utility functions in every one of them.\nContainerization makes it easier to “develop once, deploy everywhere.” That’s because instead of relying on the operating system to provide what your application needs, all dependencies are bundled in the container itself. Once the container works, you can move it around from computer to computer and between different operating systems easily.\nDocker is a containerization utility that became very popular for simplifying such tasks. Furthermore, when something goes wrong with the operating system, instead of having to reinstall and reconfigure the application, you just reinstall the operating system, copy the container back and continue where you left off.\nCleanup Old Docker Installations This is an optional step, required only if you have older Docker versions already installed. These might conflict with newer versions, especially if they come from different repositories than what you’ll use here.\nOn Debian or Ubuntu, clean up with:\nOn Fedora:\nHow to Install Docker on Ubuntu Open a terminal emulator and install prerequisites.\nCheck Docker’s GPG key fingerprint.\nAt the time of writing this tutorial, the fingerprint was 9DC858229FC7DD38854AE2D88D81803C0EBFCD88. This may change in the future. Check Docker’s official website to see if they match. The key is used to verify digital signatures, so you can make sure the software you are installing is legitimate and not malware uploaded to the server by an attacker.\nOnce you make sure you have the right key, add it to APT’s trusted keys.\nAdd Docker’s repository for Ubuntu to your software sources.\nInstall Docker.\nIf you also need Docker Compose, you can install it with:\nIf you don’t know what this is, you probably don’t need it.\nMost docker commands need to be prefixed with sudo. If you want to avoid having to type your password every time, add your user to the docker group.\nLog out of your graphical user interface and log back in. Now you can use commands such as docker ps instead of sudo docker ps.\nHow to Install Docker on Debian Since Ubuntu is created from Debian, the steps are very similar.\nCheck fingerprint which should be the same as in the previous section.\nAdd to trusted keys.\nAdd software sources.\nIf you also need Docker Compose, install it with:\nTo use Docker commands without prefixing with sudo:\nThen log out and log back in.\nHow to Install Docker on Fedora Install prerequisites.\nAdd Docker software repository.\nOn some systems this will take some time to complete and might seem like it’s stuck. Don’t abort the operation. Of course, it might also really get stuck, but give it at least ten minutes to do its job on slower computers.\nEnable auto-start of Docker at boot.\nStart Docker.\nAdd yourself to the Docker group.\nLog out and log back in to your graphical user interface.\nPeople that also need Docker Compose can install it with:\nHow to Install Docker on Arch Linux Arch already includes Docker in its community repositories, so the install procedure is easier here.\nIf you also need Docker Compose:\nAdd yourself to the Docker group:\nLog out of the graphical user interface and log back in for the setting to take effect.\nEnable Docker to automatically start at boot.\nStart the Docker service.\nConclusion Obviously, this doesn’t cover all distributions that are out there. But if you’re using something like openSUSE, you may be lucky enough to find an instruction page on how to install Docker on your distribution.\nFell in love with computers when he was four years old. 27 years later, the passion is still burning, fueling constant learning.
