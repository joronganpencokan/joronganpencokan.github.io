Your Android phone is not just a device, it’s a personal assistant, and a friend. Imagine losing it to a thief. It can be a devastating experience, especially when you have to buy a new one. According to statistics, almost 2.5 million phones are stolen or lost every year. Protecting your phone from theft doesn’t have to be complicated. Here’s a guide on how to protect your Android phone from thieves.\nInstall and Enable Find My Device Google’s Find My Device is a built-in feature available on every Android phone. Its primary purpose is to track and locate your phone if it gets lost or stolen. The Find My Device feature allows you to see your device’s location and make it ring, even when it is on silent mode. If you can’t find your phone, you can use the feature to lock it and erase data remotely. To use Find My Device, go to Settings \u003e Security \u003e Find My Device and enable it.\nUse Lock Screen and Biometric Security The lock screen feature is the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your phone. It prevents anyone from gaining access to your phone if it is stolen or lost. Biometric security, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, adds an extra layer of security to your phone’s lock. Make sure to set up a strong lock screen password or use biometric security by going to Settings \u003e Security \u003e Screen Lock.\nBe Vigilant With Your Physical Security It is equally essential to be vigilant with your phone’s physical security. Make sure to store your phone in a secure location when not in use, especially in public areas. Avoid leaving it unattended in public places like cafes or libraries. You can also invest in a sturdy protective case and consider features like water-resistance or drop protection.\nInstall Antivirus Software Antivirus software protects your device against malware and other harmful viruses. It is essential to have one installed on your Android phone to ensure its safety from malicious attacks. Antivirus software will scan your device regularly and notify you if it detects any potential threats. You can download antivirus apps from the Google Play Store like Norton Mobile Security, Avast Mobile Security, or McAfee Mobile Security.\nBackup Your Data Back up your data to ensure you don’t lose anything if your phone is stolen or lost. You can set up automatic backups to the cloud or manually back up your data regularly. Go to Settings \u003e System \u003e Backup to enable and set up automatic backups.\nFinal Thoughts Protecting your Android phone from thieves doesn’t have to be a daunting task. With a few simple steps, you can ensure your device’s safety and have peace of mind. We recommend following the tips mentioned above, such as enabling Find My Device, using lock screen and biometric security, being vigilant with physical security, installing antivirus software, and backing up your data regularly. By doing so, you can protect your phone and all the valuable information stored within it.\nUsing Chrome and signing in to your account. Is as simple as opening a new tab and typing the magic phrase. I tried this out recently and ran into one hangup. It asked me to sign in again to my account. Which required a text message via two-step authentication; I’d recently cleaned out my cookies. If I was actually missing my phone, that could induce temporary panic. You won’t be out of luck, as I could log in to the Android Device Manager site without going through the two-step process. It’s likely just another security layer to keep some random person from Googling your phone’s location. If you’ve walked away from your computer.\nLookout Offers Several Smart Features Lookout has a lot to offer if you’re seeking a security solution. That does more than track down your missing phone. Most goodies come in the paid version. Which can back up your photos and call history and provide you with a secure browser. It also scans your apps for malware. Though if you stick to the Play Store, you’re unlikely to run into such problems. Its signature feature is Theft Alerts, which will take a picture with the front-facing camera during suspicious activity. For example, you can direct your phone to this spy mode if too many incorrect PiNs are entered. If someone tries to uninstall Lookout, or if a SIM card has been removed. These, of course, require the premium plan, which is $2.99 per month or $29.99 yearly. Another advantage of Lookout is that it’s cross-platform. So you can use it to manage any iOS devices you or your family members have. Along with your Android phones or tablets. A premium account allows you three active devices, while free accounts restrict you to two.\nCerberus is Cheap but Customizable If you’re not too keen on a monthly fee, then Cerberus may be a good choice. It does require you to pay up, but it’s a one-time fee of €4.99, which is currently about $5.67. Cerberus, named after the three-headed dog of Greek mythology, has several options for directing your phone to lock itself down. For example, you can tell it to start recording audio with the microphone or sound an alarm. If someone tries to reset it or remove the SIM card. It also will hide the app icon, so if someone gets a hold of your phone. They can’t easily disable Cerberus. Along with tracking, you can send several commands to your device, like turning on Bluetooth or wiping the memory. The web interface is stuck in the past, but it includes these commands and others, so you can track or wipe your phone remotely.\nPrey Secures all Your Devices, even non-Android Prey is another good choice if you want something cross-platform that can keep tabs on multiple devices. You can sound an alarm with your phone, send a message, or lock it down if it goes missing. You can access these through Prey’s well-designed web portal. The free version will keep tabs on up to three devices. The entry-level upgrade gets you 10 devices for $15 per month. Prey has several business plans, including a $399 per month option for up to 500 devices. It also can hide the Prey icon so no thief can tinker with your settings. You can also disable the power button, so your device can’t be turned off if the screen is locked.\nSamsung Builds in Security for Galaxy Owners If you have the Galaxy S6, Note 4, or other popular modern Samsung device. You’ll find a security solution baked right in. The key here is convenience. It just takes a couple of steps to ensure it’s up and running on your device. And just like Android Device Manager, you can log in to Samsung’s find my phone site from any browser to track it down. From there, you can lock it, alert it, or use the GPS details to see if you can find it. The tools are bare bones compared to some alternatives, but it’s there if you think you’ve left your phone somewhere. Using this requires a Samsung account, which you’ll need to set up if this is your first Galaxy phone. It’s worth having in case you take advantage of Samsung’s other services, which are many.\nBe Smart about Security, say the Experts Find-your-phone solutions are reasonable but should be one of many security methods. Those in the know recommend that you consider a find-your-phone app as the last line of defense, not the first. Also, please don’t presume that your device is free from tampering. Because you have a Number or fingerprint lock on it. Ashley Hamilton of WhiteHat Security says even a fingerprint reader, like the one on the Galaxy S6, isn’t enough. The best type of protection is the same as when you protect your regular online identity. And says a strong password or Pin Number, think 6-10 characters. While a high entropy password with Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols could be more user-friendly on your mobile device. Even a slightly longer lower entropy, such as all lowercase letters with no mixing. Can be enough to deter someone from guessing it. One solution for minimizing the annoyance with such a password would be to use the Android trusted places feature. This disables the need for password prompts if you’re at home or at another location you set. Another item that too many people ignore is standard backup procedures, according to Bob O’Donnell, founder, and chief analyst for Technalysis Research. Backing up is critical because no matter how much security you use. There’s always a chance for it to be broken.\nDo Your Backup And Security Most of these problems are because people still need to do the basics. And the reality is if someone is really intent on getting it, you can do nothing to prevent it. Your focus needs to be on solving 99 percent of the cases. He also said too many people overlook backing up their devices. For Android, your specific manufacturer may have a backup solution, like Samsung’s Kies software or HTC Backup. Security aside, backing up your device protects things you can’t replace, like photos. In case you drop your phone and break it forever. So, devices that shipped with Lollipop, Android 5.0 or later, have a much improved and restore solution. When you start a new phone, so if most of your stuff is in your account, you should be OK. The bottom line is that your smartphone is the most personal computing device ever made. So it would be best to consider how much sensitive information you have. And what risks you’re willing to accept for it to end up in the wrong hands.\n","wordCount":"1650","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Deborah Parker"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-secure-your-android-phone-from-loss-or-theft1837102/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't believe how easy it is to protect your Android phone from thieves - learn how now!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-21 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 21, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1650 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Deborah Parker</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#install-and-enable-find-my-device>Install and Enable Find My Device</a></li><li><a href=#use-lock-screen-and-biometric-security>Use Lock Screen and Biometric Security</a></li><li><a href=#be-vigilant-with-your-physical-security>Be Vigilant With Your Physical Security</a></li><li><a href=#install-antivirus-software>Install Antivirus Software</a></li><li><a href=#backup-your-data>Backup Your Data</a></li><li><a href=#final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</a></li><li><a href=#lookout-offers-several-smart-features>Lookout Offers Several Smart Features</a></li><li><a href=#cerberus-is-cheap-but-customizable>Cerberus is Cheap but Customizable</a></li><li><a href=#prey-secures-all-your-devices-even-non-android>Prey Secures all Your Devices, even non-Android</a></li><li><a href=#samsung-builds-in-security-for-galaxy-owners>Samsung Builds in Security for Galaxy Owners</a></li><li><a href=#be-smart-about-security-say-the-experts>Be Smart about Security, say the Experts</a></li><li><a href=#do-your-backup-and-security>Do Your Backup And Security</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=you-wont-believe-how-easy-it-is-to-protect-your-android-phone-from-thieves---learn-how-now>You Won&rsquo;t Believe How Easy it is to Protect Your Android Phone from Thieves - Learn How Now!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#you-wont-believe-how-easy-it-is-to-protect-your-android-phone-from-thieves---learn-how-now>#</a></h1><p>Your Android phone is not just a device, it&rsquo;s a personal assistant, and a friend.

The best type of protection is the same as when you protect your regular online identity. And says a strong password or Pin Number, think 6-10 characters.

He also said too many people overlook backing up their devices. For Android, your specific manufacturer may have a backup solution, like Samsung’s Kies software or HTC Backup. Security aside, backing up your device protects things you can’t replace, like photos. In case you drop your phone and break it forever.

The bottom line is that your smartphone is the most personal computing device ever made. So it would be best to consider how much sensitive information you have. And what risks you’re willing to accept for it to end up in the wrong hands.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-roll-back-to-windows-10-from-windows-11-1864199/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Windows 11 Got You Down?
