Don’t Use Your PC Until You See This! Easy Tips to Shield Your Computer from Deadly Security Bugs!\nIn today’s world, where computers have become an essential part of our lives, the need for cybersecurity has increased tenfold. A few years ago, protecting your computer from online threats was a matter of installing an antivirus program and keeping it up to date. However, with the rapid advancements in technology, viruses and other online threats have evolved into something far more complex and sophisticated. Keeping your computer safe is not just about preventing virus attacks but also protecting it from deadly security bugs that can potentially compromise your private information.\nHere are some easy tips to shield your computer from such deadly security bugs:\nKeep your software up-to-date Outdated software can contain vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. Therefore, it’s crucial to keep all your software up-to-date. Make sure that you regularly update your operating system, web browsers, and other software programs installed on your computer.\nUse a strong password Passwords are the backbone of cybersecurity. Use a strong and unique password that contains a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Don’t reuse passwords across different accounts.\nBe cautious when downloading files Downloading files from untrusted sources can introduce security bugs into your computer. Only download files and programs from legitimate websites that you trust.\nUse two-factor authentication Two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security to your online accounts. With two-factor authentication, you need to provide both your password and a verification code sent to your phone or email to log in to your accounts.\nUse a Virtual Private Network (VPN) Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) protects your online privacy by encrypting your internet traffic. VPNs also prevent hackers from intercepting your online communication.\nUse antivirus software Antivirus software is a must-have for any computer system. It can detect and remove viruses, Trojans, and other malicious programs that can compromise your computer’s security.\nBackup your files regularly Data backups are essential in today’s world where cyber-attacks are becoming more prevalent. If a security bug manages to get through your defenses and infects your computer, you’ll be able to recover your data from a backup.\nIn conclusion, cybersecurity is not something to take lightly in today’s digital age. The above tips are simple ways to safeguard your computer from deadly security bugs. By following these tips, you can protect your computer and your sensitive information from getting into the wrong hands.\nIn short, it’s been recently disclosed that most modern processors released in the last 20 years have security vulnerabilities. These flaws are known as “Meltdown” and “Spectre,” and essentially allow malicious individuals to steal your data (e.g., passwords, encryption keys, browser history, documents, emails) stored in the protected kernel memory area on your device.\nThese are flaws at the hardware level and they affect pretty much all modern microprocessors, including those from Intel, AMD, and ARM — but Intel processors are more vulnerable as AMD says some of the vulnerabilities don’t affect its chips at all –, and this also affects versions of Windows as well as Linux, macOS, Google OS, and other OSes.\nUnfortunately, these are design flaws inside the microprocessors and they can’t be modified through software update, but hardware and software vendors can update their software to mitigate the issues. However, the solution will come with a price of performance, as it’s expected that the fixes will slow down computers up to 30 percent depending on the processor model.\nIf you’re a PC user, staying protected at this time is not easy, because we’re still in the early stages and there are many pieces to the puzzle. But there a number of things you can do to protect your device.\nInstall the latest Windows update If you’re a Windows 10 user, Microsoft has already made available an emergency patch for all versions of Windows, which is part of a series of updates to resolve these vulnerabilities.\nWindows 10 version 1709 (Fall Creators Update) is getting update KB4056892, while version 1703 (Creators Update) is receiving update KB4056891.\nOlder versions of the OS are also getting patched as well:\nKB4056890 — Windows 10 version 1607 (Anniversary Update) KB4056888 — Windows 10 version 1511 (November Update) KB4056893 — Windows 10 version 1507 (Initial Release) The update will download and install automatically, but you can always force the update on Settings \u003e Update \u0026 Security \u003e Windows Update, and clicking the Check for updates button.\nIn order to check if your device is protected go to Settings \u003e Update \u0026 Security \u003e Windows Update, click the View installed update history link and make sure, under “Quality update,” the latest update has been applied.\nWindows 8.1 and Windows 7 are also getting an update to protect computers against these processors flaws, but users running older versions of Windows won’t see the update until the next Patch Tuesday.\nIt should be noted that Microsoft has quietly already patched the test version of Windows 10 available through the Insider program.\nInstalling the update manually If your device isn’t seeing the update, it’s possible that there is a problem with Windows Update or you have an antivirus that hasn’t been updated to support the latest update.\nRecently Microsoft noted that a problem with some antivirus software that are trying to talk to kernel memory using unsupported calls, and this behavior cause a bug check — commonly known as Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).\nIn order to prevent devices from coming across this issue, Windows Update will not install the newest fixes where an unpatched antivirus solution is installed.\nYou can always get around this issue by uninstalling the third-party antivirus and use Windows Defender Antivirus until your software vendor issues an update.\nFirmware update Alongside making sure all your software is up to date, you should also make sure to check with your PC manufacturer (e.g., HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus) website for new firmware updates.\nIntel has already started to roll out fixes to address the Meltdown and Spectre issues on devices using its processors. Microsoft has just made available a firmware update to protect its Surface devices against these security bugs.\nUpdate all your software In addition, you need to make sure your applications are up to date as well. According to Mozilla, Firefox version 57 ships with a fix, Microsoft already updated Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.\nGoogle is also expected to release a fix with upcoming Chrome version 64 on January 23, but right now, you can enable Chrome Site Isolation security feature that isolates every website on its own process adding an extra layer of protection.\nWrapping things up If you have a PC running Windows, the most you can do at this time is to make sure Windows 10 has the latest update and BIOS or UEFI update installed. Beyond these recommendations, there isn’t much you can do to protect your device against the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities.\n","wordCount":"1163","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-03T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anthony Calloway"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-keep-your-pc-protected-against-meltdown-and-spectre-security-bugs-76040/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>STOP!
