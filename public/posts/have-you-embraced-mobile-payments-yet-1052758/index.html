Are you tired of carrying a bulky wallet filled with credit cards, cash, and loyalty cards? Have you ever lost your wallet and had to deal with the nightmare of canceling your cards and getting a new ID? What if there was a better way to pay for things? Well, there is! Mobile payments are here, and they are revolutionizing the way we pay for goods and services.\nMobile payments are a type of electronic payment where you can use your smartphone or wearable device to pay for things. All you need to do is download a mobile payment app, link it to your credit or debit card, and then tap your phone or device on a compatible payment terminal to complete a transaction. Some of the most popular mobile payment apps include Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, and PayPal.\nSo, why are mobile payments such a game-changer? Here are just a few of the benefits:\nConvenience Carrying a bulky wallet and fumbling through it to find the right card can be a hassle. With mobile payments, you only need to carry your smartphone or wearable device. No need to dig through your purse or pockets. Plus, you can make payments quickly and easily with just a tap of your device.\nSecurity Mobile payments are more secure than traditional credit or debit card payments. When you make a mobile payment, your actual credit card number is never transmitted to the merchant. Instead, a unique encrypted code is used to complete the transaction. This means that even if a hacker intercepts the transaction, they can’t use your credit card number to make fraudulent purchases.\nLoyalty Rewards Many mobile payment apps, like Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts, offer loyalty rewards and discounts for using the app to make purchases. This means you can save money on your favorite foods and drinks just by paying with your smartphone. Plus, you don’t have to worry about misplacing your loyalty card or forgetting to bring it with you.\nContactless Payments In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, contactless payments have become increasingly popular. With mobile payments, you can make contactless payments without having to touch anything. This means you can safely and conveniently pay for goods and services without having to exchange cash, cards, or signatures.\nReal-Time Notifications When you make a mobile payment, you usually receive a real-time notification on your smartphone or device. This means you can keep track of your spending and quickly detect any unauthorized transactions. You can also set up notifications for every time a transaction is made on your account, which is especially handy if you’re trying to keep an eye on your spending.\nIn conclusion, mobile payments are a game-changer that you can’t afford to ignore. They offer convenience, security, loyalty rewards, contactless payments, and real-time notifications. If you haven’t tried mobile payments yet, download a mobile payment app and try it out for yourself. You might be surprised at how much easier and more secure it is to pay with your smartphone or wearable device.\nWe are becoming increasingly more dependent on credit cards because of their ease of use and more purchasing being doing through online sources. Ask yourself when you wrote a check last.\nBecause of that, it has changed the way credit cards are accepted. There are no more of those slider machines that take an imprint of your card. Increasingly the store clerk doesn’t even have to handle it, as you either slide the card yourself, tap it on a reader, or insert it in a chip reader.\nThat is, unless you have decided to rely on mobile payments such as Apple Pay or Google Pay. This form of payment can be used both online or increasingly more and more at stores. Have you embraced mobile payments yet?\nOur Opinion Simon explains he’s been using an app that lets him purchase digital bus tickets to show when boarding, which means he makes constant use of Google Pay. “A great convenience for me!”\nDamien notes that while his country is quite technologically advanced, and a lot of retail shops are supporting both Apple Pay and Google Pay, he finds himself “quite reluctant to use it.” He finds it faster to “just tap my credit card for contactless payment.”\nAlex admits to using Apple Pay to some extent. There are two things that stop him from using it more. One is that “it can cause confusion with cashiers since it’s a less common payment method.” Secondly, because acceptance of Apple Pay isn’t universal, he still has to carry his wallet with his debit card. “Otherwise, I can still easily get caught out.”\nSayak only uses mobile payment apps on a need basis and keeps them disabled when they’re not in use. After he experienced a phone theft, he has been wary about carrying sensitive information on his phone. “Giving a thief access to a mobile payment app and one-time passwords on the same phone is like giving him the keys to your bank account.” He notes, too, that banks are forcing customers to use mobile apps, but he wonders what is wrong with doing the same transaction on a mobile browser.\nFabio explains that when there’s an app that he really wants or needs he uses Google Pay but tries to use it as little as possible.\nRyan adds that he would use mobile payments if he lived in the United States, noting that the banking system there is very fractured with many people using smaller, regional banks, which makes it harder for them to adopt newer technology.\nIn Australia, it’s dominated by just a handful of companies, and that “allows new technologies to be embraced and put into practice nationwide very quickly.” He notes his debit card has “tap and go” functionality, allowing him to tap his card, not insert a PIN, and not sign, and that technology has been around for a number of years. So he doesn’t use Apple Pay, as it gives him little advantage.\nAs Alex said, Apple Pay isn’t really universal. I sometimes see the Apple Pay logo but not always. Because of that, I use Apple Pay whenever I can online. But when I’m out and about, I insert my card in the chip reader.\nAnd I do live in the U.S. and have a debit card through a credit union that is very hard to work with because it often doesn’t have new technology as Ryan noted, yet am still able to not use a PIN and not sign, and I’ve done that for a number of years as well. Conversely, I’ll add my sister works for one of the largest banks in the U.S., and she does not use mobile payments, not even online.\nDo you just tap your card or insert it in a reader and find that’s easier than using Apple Pay or Google Pay? Or do you try to use mobile payments as much as possible, ignoring the debit card and/or credit card you have in your wallet? Have you embraced mobile payments yet?
