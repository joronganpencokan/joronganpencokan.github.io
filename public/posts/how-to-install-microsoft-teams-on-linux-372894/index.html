Microsoft Teams has been an essential tool for organizations that have adopted the remote work structure. It is a collaborative platform that Microsoft designed to help teams communicate and collaborate effectively.

If you are a Linux user and have been searching for a tool to help you collaborate effectively with your team, you should give Microsoft Teams a try. In this article, we will show you how easy it is to install Microsoft Teams on Linux.\nWhat is Microsoft Teams? Microsoft Teams is a platform developed by Microsoft for its Office 365 suite. The software aims to improve communication and collaboration between individuals and teams from different locations. The platform combines chat, video meetings, file storage, and application integration to enhance productivity.\nWith Microsoft Teams, you can:\nStart chats or voice and video calls with anyone in your organization. Share files with individuals, a team, or the entire organization. Collaborate on documents with anyone in your organization in real-time. Hold meetings with up to 10,000 attendees. Integrate with other Microsoft and third-party services. How to Install Microsoft Teams on Linux Installing Microsoft Teams on Linux is easy and straightforward. Microsoft Teams is available in both .deb and .rpm formats. This means that it can be installed on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Follow the steps below to install Microsoft Teams on Linux.\nStep 1: Download the Installation File Download the installation file from the Microsoft Teams download page. Choose the appropriate version for your Linux distribution. If you’re on Ubuntu, select the .deb package, and if you’re on CentOS or Fedora, choose the .rpm package.\nStep 2: Install Microsoft Teams After downloading the installation file, navigate to the directory where the file was downloaded using the terminal. Run the following command:\nsudo apt install ./teams_*.deb For Fedora or CentOS, run:\nsudo dnf install ./teams-*.rpm Ubuntu and Debian users can also install Microsoft Teams using the following command:\nsudo apt install teams The above command will automatically download and install Microsoft Teams on your system.\nStep 3: Launch Microsoft Teams After the installation is complete, you can launch Microsoft Teams from the menu or the terminal. To launch it from the terminal, execute the following command:\nteams Conclusion Microsoft Teams is a powerful tool that enhances collaboration in teams, and now, it’s accessible for Linux users too. Installing it on Linux is simple and quick, and you can start benefiting from its features in no time. With its chat, video conferencing, and file-sharing capabilities, Microsoft Teams will make collaboration easier than ever. So, don’t hesitate to install it on your Linux machine and embrace the power of teamwork.\nReference “How to Install Microsoft Teams on Ubuntu 20.04/18.04 \u0026 Debian 10/9 | Tecrobust.”.\nIn this current world of video conferencing and working from home, software like Zoom, WebEx, and Microsoft Teams has become increasingly important. As Linux users, we’re often limited to Zoom and Google Meet, since things like WebEx won’t work at all and other’s won’t work well. However, since Microsoft released Teams for Linux, there has been another option, one that enables more Linux users to use Linux in their workplaces without fear of not being able to attend meetings. We show you in this article how to install Microsoft Teams on Linux so you can get to work.\nHow to Install Microsoft Teams on Linux There are two major ways to install Microsoft Teams on Linux. They’re for people who have different use cases, but it’s important to represent both.\nThe first way is to go to the Microsoft Teams Downloads page to find the appropriate package for your typically-targeted distro, whether that’s a .deb or a .rpm file. There’s also a package for Arch Linux in the AUR. These will run very well on your system, but you’ll have to adjust to the typical way that packages are updated for Linux: going to the website and grabbing the latest version.\nThe other way is through universal package formats, like Snap and Flatpak. These can be helpful because these packages are confined, so they won’t have too much access to your system, which can be helpful for telemetry purposes. This also allows distros that don’t use .rpm or .deb files or don’t have access to the AUR, like Solus or Clear Linux.\nInstalling Microsoft Teams on Linux Through the Downloads Page To install this way, go to the official Microsoft Teams Downloads page and click on “Download for desktop.”\nOnce you’re there, click the appropriate file for your distro. In my case, I’ll be downloading the .rpm file since I’m running Fedora on this system.\nOnce the download completes, it will likely pop up in your software center of choice, but you can also install it with either the dpkg or the rpm command, depending on your system.\nOnce you install the package, you can open it, sign in and begin using it.\nAs a Snap or Flatpak To install as a Snap or Flatpak, make sure you have snapd or flatpak installed on your system. Most distros now have one or the other pre-installed.\nThen, use one of the following commands to install the universal package:\nClick the icon in your app menu and sign in with your Teams account.\nThat’s it.\nNow that you know how to install Microsoft Teams on Linux, make sure you check out some of our other Linux content, such as how to install Microsoft Defender antivirus on Linux, how to back up files to Google Drive on Linux, and how to easily create cron jobs with Zeit.\nJohn is a young technical professional with a passion for educating users on the best ways to use their technology.
