Do you find the process to be a hassle, with constant pop-ups, sign-in requirements, and updates? Well, fret no more! We have uncovered a secret trick to help you bypass the Windows Store and install your desired apps with ease.\nFirst, let’s take a look at why you might want to avoid the Windows Store altogether. While it is undoubtedly convenient to access all your apps in one place, the Windows Store has its fair share of drawbacks. For starters, it relies on Microsoft’s servers, which might be prone to outages or slowdowns. Additionally, it has a complex and intrusive sign-in process, which requires you to create a Microsoft account and sign in whenever you want to install an app. Finally, the Windows Store has a limited selection of apps, so you might be missing out on some great options.\nSo, what is the solution to these issues? The answer lies in the side-loading feature of Windows 8. Side-loading refers to the process of installing apps from sources other than the Windows Store. While this feature is turned off by default in Windows 8, it is relatively easy to enable it.\nHere’s how to enable side-loading on Windows 8:\nOpen the “Group Policy Editor” by typing “gpedit.msc” in the start screen.\nFrom there, navigate to “Computer Configuration” \u003e “Administrative Templates” \u003e “Windows Components” \u003e “App Package Deployment.”\nLook for the option “Allow all trusted apps to install” and double-click it.\nSelect the “Enabled” option and click “OK.”\nThat’s it! You have now enabled side-loading on your Windows 8 device. So how do you get your hands on those apps you’ve been missing? It’s simple – visit the app developer’s website and download the installation package. Once the download is complete, double-click the package, and follow the installation prompts. Easy peasy!\nOne thing to keep in mind when using side-loading is that you need to trust the source of the app you’re installing. This is because side-loading bypasses the security measures of the Windows Store, which ensures that apps are safe and secure. Therefore, only download apps from reliable sources that you trust.\nIn conclusion, side-loading is an excellent way to unlock the full potential of your Windows 8 device without the hassle of the Windows Store. By enabling this feature and downloading apps directly from their sources, you can enjoy a broader selection of apps, avoid pop-ups and sign-in requirements, and minimize the risk of interruptions. So go ahead, give it a try, and let us know how it works for you!\nBy default, Windows 8 only allows users to install apps from the Windows Store. If you want to download third party apps that haven’t cleared Microsoft’s security checks, you can do so by enabling an entry in the Local Group Policy for your PC. Once you’ve enabled the entry, you’ll be able to install windows 8 apps without the store.\nProceed with caution Before you add non-Windows Store apps to Windows 8, it’s important to understand why Microsoft has made this difficult to do. While part of it has to do with forcing you to use apps they deem fit for the OS, it also has to do with security. Whenever you download an app from a developer, you’re not 100% sure you know what you’re getting.\nWhen you install an app from the Windows Store, you know that Microsoft has vetted the app and ensured it’s as trustworthy as it can be. This is similar to the way the Chrome Web Store, the Apple Store and other online app distribution services do business. Proceed with caution!\nInstall Windows 8 Apps without the Store These steps will work for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.\nSearch for “Run” from the Windows Start screen and click on it to open its command prompt.\nType in “gpedit.msc” and click “OK.”\nFrom the main screen of the Local Group Policy Editor, you want to head to the following entry:\nRight-click on “Allow all trusted apps to install.”\nYou’ll want to enable this entry to all non-Windows Store apps to install in Windows 8. Make sure to click “Apply,” then “OK” to change the entry’s settings.\nBefore you install any non-Windows Store apps, they still must meet two criteria:\nThe developer must cryptographically sign the app Your computer must be able to accept the certificate If the app meets these two conditions, then you’ll want to use Windows PowerShell to run the following command: “app1.appx” is the app you want to install, you’ll need to change this as necessary depending on how it’s named.\n“winjs.appx” is the dependency for the app, which you’ll also need to change if necessary. The dependency will be included with the app.\nNow, you’re ready to use your new non-Windows Store app on Windows 8.\nMake sure you’re only installing these apps from trusted sources and always keep a Windows 8 system recovery image or backup handy in case you run into issues.\nConclusion There are a lot of good apps out there that don’t meet the requirements of the Windows Store, even though they should. If you’ve found one that you want to add to Windows 8, following the above steps can get it working on your computer.\nMelissa Popp has been a freelance writer for over a decade.
