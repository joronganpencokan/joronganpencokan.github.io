Have you beaten the game but feel like something is missing? Perhaps you’ve heard rumors of a secret ending that few have unlocked? Well, fear not because we’re here to unveil Hades’ true ending and show you how to unlock this ultimate conclusion now.\nFirst, let’s recap the story of Hades. The game follows Zagreus, the son of Hades, on his journey to escape the underworld and reach the surface world, all while fighting various enemies and bosses. Along the way, he discovers secrets about his family, friends, and the gods of Olympus.\nBut did you know there is a secret ending to the game? Unlike the normal ending, which sees Zagreus escaping to the surface world, the true ending offers a new level of depth to the game’s narrative.\nTo unlock the true ending, you need to have beaten the game at least ten times, at which point you’ll be given a new objective to complete.\nOnce this is done, you need to encounter a new NPC called “Hypnos.” After talking to him, you will be given a new quest to complete. This quest requires you to collect a series of items called “Remnants,” which are scattered throughout the game.\nTo collect these Remnants, you will need to revisit various boss fights and interact with objects in the environments. It can be challenging and will require a keen eye, but the reward is worth it.\nAfter collecting all the Remnants, you need to return them to Hypnos, who will provide you with a new key. This key will unlock a new door located in the final area of the game.\nOnce you enter through the door, you will be faced with a challenging new environment and a series of daunting boss battles. But push through, and you’ll be rewarded with Hades’ true ending, which will offer you a whole new perspective on the game’s story.\nSo what makes this ending so special? Well, without giving away the plot, we can say it adds significant depth to the game’s narrative and offers resolutions to various plot threads left hanging in the standard ending.\nOverall, unlocking Hades’ true ending is no small feat, but for fans of the game, it’s well worth the effort. Not only will it provide a satisfying conclusion to the story, but it will give you a new level of appreciation for the game’s world and lore.\nSo, if you’ve beaten Hades multiple times and are hungry for more, go out and collect those Remnants, unlock that door, and discover the secret to unlocking the ultimate conclusion now!\nIf you have played Hades till the end in the Early access mode, you know that there was no real or true ending in it. Well, Supergiant Games have added the true ending in Hades in the version 1.0 which is wonderful news for fans. Curious to know what it is? Then here’s your Spoiler warning. Proceed only if you want the ending spoiled for you. Ready? Alrighty then!\nWhat is the Hades True Ending? The v1.0 update brought along quite a few changes including bug fixes and of course, the Hades true ending. This ending is important because it will determine how things move ahead in further updates or possible sequels of the game. So, here’s how to get the real and final ending in the game.\nFinal Spoiler Alert Basically, Zagreus will defeat Hades and then enter a portal which takes him to Greece. Yes, the story moves from the Underworld into Greece where Zagreus sees the sun which is quite a moment for him. That is because in the Underworld, he couldn’t know if it’s day time or night time, but now he can actually see the sun. Sweet.\nAfter this, Zagreus has a reunion Persephone, his real mother. But what happens next is surprising – Zagreus dies and finds himself in the Underworld once again. He is unable to live on Earth and gets thrown back to the Underworld.\nThis ending actually motivates players to continue playing even after meeting the mother. It is being said that if you haven’t seen the credits roll, you haven’t unlocked the final true ending. For the final ending, you have to meet Persephone multiple times and that means you have to finish the game over and over again. Some say that you have to beat Hades 10 times to get it, so go ahead and try that out.\nThis is everything that is known about the true ending in Hades. If you need some more tips and tricks, here’s How to Get Titan Blood Easily in Hades \u0026 How to use it, how to get all Hidden Aspects, who to give Nectar to, upgrade weapons and how long it takes to beat.\n","wordCount":"824","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tim Sparrow"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/hades-true-ending-how-to-unlock-true-ending-answered-1771218/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unveiling Hades' True Ending: Discover the Secret to Unlocking the Ultimate Conclusion Now!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-29 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 29, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;824 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Tim Sparrow</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#what-is-the-hades-true-ending>What is the Hades True Ending?</a><ul><li><a href=#final-spoiler-alert>Final Spoiler Alert</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>+++
