Here’s Why You’re Making a BIG Mistake and How to Get Them Sparkling Clean! Your Mac keyboard and mouse are essential tools for staying productive and getting work done.

Studies have shown that keyboards can harbor more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat. This is because we often eat at our desks and don’t wash our hands frequently enough.\nIf you’re sharing your keyboard and mouse with others, the risk of illness is even higher. The flu virus can survive for up to 24 hours on a surface like a keyboard, and the norovirus can live for days.\nAdditionally, dust, dirt, and grime can build up on your keyboard and mouse, causing them to become less responsive and perform poorly.\nRegular cleaning can help reduce the risk of illness and improve the performance of your equipment.\nHow to Clean Your Mac Keyboard and Mouse Cleaning your Mac keyboard and mouse is a simple process that doesn’t require any special tools or equipment.\nTurn off your computer and unplug your keyboard and mouse. Use a dry, lint-free cloth to wipe down the surface of your keyboard and mouse. You can also use a can of compressed air to blow out any dust or debris that has accumulated in between the keys. For stubborn grime or dirt, you can use a small amount of rubbing alcohol or soap and water to clean your keyboard and mouse. Apply the solution to a cloth and gently rub the affected area. For hard-to-reach areas like the crevices between your keys, use an old toothbrush to scrub away any dirt or grime. Once you’ve finished cleaning, let your keyboard and mouse dry completely before plugging them back in and turning on your computer. It’s recommended that you clean your keyboard and mouse at least once a month to keep them in good condition.\nFinal Thoughts Cleaning your Mac keyboard and mouse is an important task that shouldn’t be overlooked.

From that day forward, little bits of grime, dust, and dirt have been building up on these often-used peripherals. The buildup of gunk slowly causes your mouse to feel less responsive and may even cause your keyboard to miss a key click or two now and then.\nApple recommends you take your keyboard to an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider for service if the compressed air doesn’t fix the stuck-key problem.\nYou could always buy a new Mac keyboard, of course, but frequently cleaning your current one can keep it useful for a good long while.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1767","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alan Mcnamee"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-keep-your-mac-keyboard-and-mouse-clean390706/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Never Clean Your Mac Keyboard and Mouse?
