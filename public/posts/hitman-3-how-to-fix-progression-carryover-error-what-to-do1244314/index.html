Hitman 3 is one of the most popular video games currently available, and it has attracted a massive following of dedicated players. However, recently, there has been an unexpected problem that has left many gamers devastated: the progression carryover error.\nThe progression carryover feature allows players to transfer their progress from previous Hitman games into Hitman 3, which is crucial for people who have invested a lot of time and effort into the franchise. Unfortunately, some players have encountered an error during the transfer process, which has caused them to lose their hard-earned progress.\nThankfully, there is a crucial fix that you need to know about right now. Here is everything you need to know.\nWhat Causes the Progression Carryover Error? The progression carryover error can occur due to a variety of factors. Here are some of the most common reasons why you might experience this problem:\nIncorrect Profile One of the most common causes of the progression carryover error is a mismatch between the profile used in previous games and the profile used in Hitman 3. If the games use different profiles, the transfer process will not work, and you will lose your progress.\nMissing DLC Another possible cause of the problem is missing DLC (Downloadable Content) or add-ons. To ensure that your progress carries over correctly, you need to make sure that all the DLC and add-ons associated with the previous games are installed in Hitman 3.\nServer Issues Sometimes, server issues can also cause the progression carryover error. If the servers are down, the transfer process will not work, and you will need to wait until the problem is resolved before trying again.\nThe Crucial Fix Now that you know what causes the progression carryover error, it’s time to talk about the crucial fix. Here are the steps that you need to follow:\nStep 1: Check Your Profiles The first thing you need to do is check that you are using the correct profile in Hitman 3. To do this, open the game, go to the profile menu, and make sure that you are logged in with the same profile that you used in previous games.\nStep 2: Install DLC Next, make sure that all the DLC and add-ons associated with the previous games are installed in Hitman 3. You can do this by going to the “store” section of the game and checking which DLCs you have purchased.\nStep 3: Try Again If you have checked your profiles and installed all the necessary DLC, try the transfer process again. If the servers are up and running, your progress should carry over without any issues.\nConclusion The progression carryover error has caused a lot of frustration and disappointment among Hitman 3 players. However, by following the crucial fix outlined in this article, you can ensure that your progress carries over correctly, and you can continue enjoying the game.\nRemember to check your profiles, install all the necessary DLC, and try the transfer process again if you encounter any issues. With a little bit of patience and perseverance, you can enjoy all the benefits of the progression carryover feature, and continue playing Hitman 3 to your heart’s content.\nThe World of Assassination trilogy has finally concluded with an Epic bang. We recommend this a must-play for all stealth genre fans out there. Continuing from where Hitman 2 left off, this time Agent 47 visits six different locations from Dubai to Romania in the base game. We’ve listed all Hitman 3 locations right here. But IO Interactive has promised us the ability to import levels, maps, and progression from both previous titles to Hitman 3. But currently, this feature is not working properly. Let’s look at the issue in more depth and decide if you should start playing the game right away or hold on to it. Here’s how to fix the carryover status error in Hitman 3.\nHow To Fix Level and Progression Carryover Status Error Issue in Hitman 3 Right now there is no official fix for the problem. IO Interactive is working right now on the fix and giving updates to the community through their official Twitter. If the Hitman 3 carry over website is not working, all you can do is patiently wait.\nAccording to IOI’s Twitter thread, IOI says “If you complete the process and see that your request has ‘failed’, it will be placed in a queue on our end and processed. You can do no more.”\nUpdate on progression carryover:\nWe’re processing thousands of players and getting more of you playing.\nIf you complete the process and see that your request has ‘failed’, it will be placed in a queue on our end and processed. You can do no more.\n(1/2) pic.twitter.com/cZxauCnzyI\n— IO Interactive (@IOInteractive) January 20, 2021\nIOI has requested all their player base to check Twitter instead of the official website to know when the issue will be fixed.\nWe’re hard at work on getting IOI Account back online to enable progression carryover.\nWe’ll tell you when it’s fully operational again. Please press F5 on Twitter instead of our site. We want it back up and running just as much as you do. Thanks! pic.twitter.com/4St0a2hYtQ\nAnother tweet says, “Once you reach the ‘Status’ page of the progression carryover site, we’ll take it from there. You’re in a queue and need to wait. When the status is ‘Finished’, you’re all set.”\nOnce you reach the ‘Status’ page of the progression carryover site, we’ll take it from there. You’re in a queue and need to wait.\nWhen the status is ‘Finished’, you’re all set. https://t.co/92wdnaSpED\nThis progress carryover error is happening because of mainly Steam players trying to carry the progress to Epic game stores. For some, the error message appears on the screen as “Status: Error“, for some others just half of the items from previous games are being transferred.\nHitman 3: Should I Start Playing Now? Also note that, while you can start your experience as Agent 47 in Hitman 3, we suggest you not to go far ahead in the game. Because once the Carryover issue is fixed by IOI and you transfer the maps from the previous game, all your Hitman 3 game progress will be reset back to the beginning. So most of the players have to hold to their new copy of Hitman 3 till an official fix is announced from IOI.\nWe will be updating this post once we hear more from IOI. With that cleared up, for now, check out our Beginners tips that are important for newbies and veterans of the franchise. Also, check out more of our Hitman 3 guides while you are waiting for the official fix.\n","wordCount":"1135","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Turner"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/hitman-3-how-to-fix-progression-carryover-error-what-to-do1244314/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Hitman 3 players devastated by progression carryover error - Here's the crucial fix you need to know now!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 8, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1135 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mary Turner</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#what-causes-the-progression-carryover-error>What Causes the Progression Carryover Error?</a><ul><li><a href=#incorrect-profile>Incorrect Profile</a></li><li><a href=#missing-dlc>Missing DLC</a></li><li><a href=#server-issues>Server Issues</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#the-crucial-fix>The Crucial Fix</a><ul><li><a href=#step-1-check-your-profiles>Step 1: Check Your Profiles</a></li><li><a href=#step-2-install-dlc>Step 2: Install DLC</a></li><li><a href=#step-3-try-again>Step 3: Try Again</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-fix-level-and-progression-carryover-status-error-issue-in-hitman-3>How To Fix Level and Progression Carryover Status Error Issue in Hitman 3</a><ul><li><a href=#hitman-3-should-i-start-playing-now>Hitman 3: Should I Start Playing Now?</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=hitman-3-players-devastated-by-progression-carryover-error---heres-the-crucial-fix-you-need-to-know-now>Hitman 3 players devastated by progression carryover error - Here&rsquo;s the crucial fix you need to know now!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hitman-3-players-devastated-by-progression-carryover-error---heres-the-crucial-fix-you-need-to-know-now>#</a></h1><p>Hitman 3 is one of the most popular video games currently available, and it has attracted a massive following of dedicated players.
