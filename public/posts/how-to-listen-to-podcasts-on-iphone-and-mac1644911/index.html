Some of the top apps include Apple Podcasts, Overcast, and Pocket Casts.\nApple Podcasts is a great choice for those who want a simple and easy-to-use app that seamlessly integrates with their iPhone and Mac. Overcast is perfect for power users who want to customize their listening experience, while Pocket Casts is great for those who want a sleek and user-friendly interface.\nStep 2: Subscribe to Your Favorite Podcasts Once you have chosen your app, the next step is to subscribe to your favorite podcasts. Podcasts are free to listen to and can be found on a variety of platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Soundcloud.\nTo subscribe to a podcast, simply search for it within your chosen app and hit the subscribe button. This will automatically download new episodes as they become available, ensuring that you never miss a beat.\nStep 3: Create Custom Playlists Creating custom playlists is a great way to stay organized and ensure that you always have something to listen to. Most podcast apps allow you to create custom playlists based on your interests or topics of choice, allowing you to easily find your favorite episodes.\nTo create a custom playlist, simply select the episodes you want to add and hit the add to playlist button. You can then customize the order, add or remove episodes as needed, and enjoy your custom playlist on the go.\nStep 4: Set Custom Playback Speeds One of the biggest benefits of podcast listening is the ability to learn and absorb information at your own pace.

From here, you can choose a custom playback speed, allowing you to consume content at a speed that works for you.\nStep 5: Use Voice Commands Finally, using voice commands can be a great way to consume podcasts on your iPhone and Mac without having to manually navigate through your app. Both Siri on your iPhone and Mac’s voice command system allow you to control your podcasting experience with simple voice commands.\nTo use voice commands, simply activate Siri or voice commands and give a voice command such as “Play the latest episode of Joe Rogan Experience.” The app will automatically play the requested podcast, allowing you to listen hands-free.\nIn conclusion, consuming podcasts on your iPhone and Mac doesn’t have to be difficult or time-consuming.
