They are used to store music, videos, documents, and photos, and they are portable, easy to use, and affordable. However, not everyone knows how to mount an SD card on their Android device, leaving them unable to access their important files.\nIf you’re one of those people, don’t worry. In this article, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about mounting an SD card on your Android device.\nStep 1: Check if your device has an SD card slot:\nBefore you attempt to mount an SD card on your Android device, you need to confirm that the device has a slot for an SD card. Most high-end devices come with an SD card slot, but some mid-range and entry-level devices may not.\nTo find out if your device has an SD card slot, check the user manual or look at the device’s specifications online.\nStep 2: Insert the SD card:\nAssuming your device has an SD card slot, the next step is to insert the SD card. To do this, locate the SD card slot, which is typically on the side of the device or under the back cover, and gently insert the SD card. Be sure to insert the SD card the right way, or you may damage the card and the device.\nStep 3: Mount the SD card:\nOnce you’ve inserted the SD card, it’s time to mount it. To mount an SD card on an Android device, follow these steps:\nGo to the settings app on your device.\nScroll down and select “Storage.”\nTap on “Mount SD card” or “Mount external storage.”\nWait until the device successfully mounts the SD card.\nStep 4: Unmount the SD card:\nWhen you want to remove the SD card from your device, you’ll need to unmount it first. Unmounting an SD card is critical to prevent data loss, corruption, and other issues. To unmount an SD card on an Android device, follow these steps:\nGo to the settings app on your device.\nScroll down and select “Storage.”\nTap on “Unmount SD card” or “Unmount external storage.”\nWait until the device successfully unmounts the SD card.\nPro Tip: Use a reliable SD card:\nTo avoid issues with your SD card, it’s essential to use a reliable brand and product. Cheap and low-quality SD cards are prone to data loss, corruption, and other issues. Thus, investing in a good SD card will save you a lot of headaches down the road.\nConclusion:\nMounting an SD card on an Android device is easy and straightforward. By following the simple steps outlined in this article, you can access and store files on an SD card without any issues. Remember to use a reliable SD card to avoid issues, and always unmount the SD card before removing it from the device.\nAfter the blip when smartphone manufacturers thought creating devices without expandable storage was a good idea, we are now seeing manufacturers adding an SD card slot to the phones again. If you’re ready to expand your storage, it’s as simple as learning to mount an SD card on your Android device.\nHere we show you how to mount your SD card, unmount it, and what this whole mounting malarkey means in the first place.\nWhy Mount Your SD Card? Whatever device you put an SD card into, you’ll need to mount it, which means the SD card becomes readable by whatever device it’s in. Think of it a bit like a mini-installation, which makes the SD card visible to the device and makes it play nice with processes and software on your specific phone. When you unmount it, the SD card disconnects from your device.\nIf you don’t mount an SD card on your Android device, it won’t be readable by your device. If you don’t unmount your SD card before removing it, you risk losing data on the card, as you didn’t give it the chance to disconnect at the software level before pulling out the hardware (sort of like switching off your PC at the mains instead of going through the Shutdown process).\nHow to Mount an SD Card on Your Android Phone Mounting an SD card should be as simple as inserting it into your Android device, then following the prompt to “Mount” it. Some more modern smartphones automatically mount your SD card without asking, while on others you may need to go to “Settings -\u003e Storage -\u003e SD card” and follow the prompt to mount it from there. Once your SD card is mounted, it’s ready to use with your Android device.\nHow to Unmount (Or Eject) Your SD Card For the most part, the term “unmount” has been replaced with the much more familiar term “Eject” these days, because it essentially means the same thing (although don’t expect your SD card to pop out of your Android phone like a VHS tape).\nTo eject your SD card, go to “Settings -\u003e Storage,” then tap the “Eject” icon next to your SD card. Alternatively, tap all the way through to your SD card, then tap “Eject.” (Some older phones will have the “Unmount” option instead, which does the same thing.)\nMost of you will know this already, but just to be sure, unmounting/ejecting doesn’t erase the data from your SD card (not to be confused with formatting, which will completely wipe your SD card).\nSD Card Not Detected by Phone If you try to mount an SD card on your Android device, but it’s not recognized, you should try formatting it on your PC to the “exFAT” format, which is readable on most Android phones. Insert the SD card into your Windows PC, right-click it in File Explorer, then click “Format.”\nThe main options you want to select in the new window are “exFAT” and a 1024kb unit size, which is a good default to have.\nIf that doesn’t work, you should try inserting a different microSD card into your phone to work out whether the problem is with the phone or the card.\nUsing SD Cards without an SD Card Slot Even though newer Android devices are being shipped with increasingly more storage, you may still want to use an SD card to quickly back up files to external storage. If your device doesn’t have an SD card slot, you may still be able to technically mount an SD card on your Android device. You’ll only be able to use it for file storage, but it gives you an extra option.\nYou’ll need an on-the-go USB cable adapter. If you have a micro-USB charging port, you’ll need something like the UGREEN Micro USB 2.0 OTG Cable On The Go Adapter. If you have a USB-C charging port, you’ll need something like the JSAUX Type C OTG Cable. Attach a standard USB flash drive or USB card reader to the Type A end and the other end to your Android device.\nUse your desired file manager to move files to your SD card or USB drive from your Android device. Remember, this is just for file storage, not app storage.\nWrapping Up You should now know everything there is to know about the increasingly integrated process of mounting and unmounting (see ejecting) an SD card. If PCs are anything to go by, we may reach a point where you can just remove SD cards without having to “Eject” them first, but for now, keep playing it safe and do your mounting and unmounting in accordance with our guide.\nWant to use your SD card as the Android internal storage?
