Skype offers a simple, always-available way to be sure: the Echo/Test Sound Service. These instructions apply to Skype version 12 or higher on Windows 10, 8, or 7 and Mac OS X 10.10 or higher.\nWhat to Know\nLog in to Skype and select the Contacts tab, then choose Echo/Test Sound Service.

If it fails to connect to Skype’s server, troubleshoot your internet connection. Make a Skype Test Call After you install Skype on your computer or before an important call, verify that your audio is working well and that your computer’s connection to the internet and to Skype are strong enough to facilitate a call. You also should check that you’re able to hear well and that the person on the other end can hear you, too.\nStart Skype and log in to your account. Select the Contacts tab in the panel on the left, which is where all your contacts are displayed. Among them, you’ll see a link for the Echo/Test Sound Service. If your contact list is sorted alphabetically, it will appear under E. Select Echo/Test Sound Service to open its details on the main pane of the interface. Select the calling button to initiate the call. A female voice will welcome you and introduce you to the service for 10 seconds. After the beep, speak into your microphone; the service records your voice for 10 seconds, so for the most thorough test, continue talking for the duration. After the second beep, your recorded voice will playback for 10 seconds. Then, you’ll hear the female voice again, explaining that the test has concluded. If you hear your voice clearly during the playback, your audio is configured properly, and you can make voice calls without a problem. If you don’t hear your own recording, your microphone might be misconfigured or damaged.\nStart Skype and log in to your account.\nSelect the Contacts tab in the panel on the left, which is where all your contacts are displayed.
