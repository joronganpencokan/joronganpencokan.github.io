You may again in future get blurry pictures but to avoid that, you can always take precautions.</p><p>We bring you tips to avoid the following from happening in the near future. Let us dive in.</p><ol><li>Adjust Shutter Speed</li></ol><p>In almost every case of blurry pictures, it is always the unadjusted shutter of the camera. To avoid getting blurry images, try knowing the speed of your shutter and taking multiple photos of your object. You have a variety of options to choose from.</p><p>When clicking in low light, where you will be lengthening the shutter speed to add more light, what you have to avoid is having a lower shutter speed than your focal length. It is critical to have a fast shutter speed, as a slower shutter speed can contribute to undesirable blurry images.</p><p>When clicking the pictures, try focusing on the object when hitting the shutter or staying still to further avoid the chance of getting blurry pictures.</p><ol start=2><li>Use Eye Autofocus</li></ol><p>It is a good thing that the latest cameras have built-in Eye Autofocus. This technology detects the eyes of people and animals to ensure that the eyes are in perfect focus. By using Eye Autofocus, you can make sure to get not only a perfect focus but also avoid blur in your photos.</p><p>Though handy, it is at the end of the day a technology which is why take multiple pictures to review later.</p><ol start=3><li>Shoot in Burst Mode</li></ol><p>Burst mode is a feature that is available on almost all cameras. It enables you to take multiple pictures at once. Hence, there is a chance that you might retrieve sharp and clear pictures. Use burst mode to avoid getting blurry pictures in the future.</p><ol start=4><li>Use Image Review</li></ol><p>Most of us instinctively check the captured photos, and most cameras have the ability to zoom in on the photo on the back LCD screen. By zooming in, you can easily view any problems with the focus. If you don’t, try reviewing your photos, as this will help you decide whether you need to reshoot them or not, and even if you do, you can reshoot them right away.</p><ol start=5><li>Use Tripod</li></ol><p>Using a tripod will definitely let you capture uninterrupted and stable pictures. Yes, not everyone owns a tripod, but you can use any stand available to you. Even a table works! The main objective is to create stable and clear pictures.</p><h3 id=is-there-a-free-app-to-clear-up-blurry-pictures>Is there a free app to clear up blurry pictures?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#is-there-a-free-app-to-clear-up-blurry-pictures>#</a></h3><p>Yes, there are many software available out there that are absolutely free.
