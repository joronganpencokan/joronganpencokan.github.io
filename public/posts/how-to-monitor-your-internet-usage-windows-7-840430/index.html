Do you often wonder how much time you spend browsing the internet? Are you curious about which websites you visit the most? If you’re using Windows 7, you can easily track your internet usage like a pro with just a few simple steps.\nHere’s how to do it:\nStep 1: Open up the Windows Task Manager The Windows Task Manager is a powerful tool that allows you to monitor and manage various aspects of your computer’s performance. To open it up, simply right-click on the taskbar and choose “Task Manager” from the list of options.\nStep 2: Navigate to the “Performance” tab Once you have the Task Manager open, click on the “Performance” tab to bring up a list of various performance metrics for your computer.\nStep 3: Check the “Ethernet” or “Wi-Fi” section Under the “Performance” tab, you’ll see several sections detailing different aspects of your computer’s performance. Look for the “Ethernet” or “Wi-Fi” section - this is where you’ll find information about your internet usage.\nStep 4: Monitor your internet usage Now that you’re looking at the Ethernet/Wi-Fi section, you’ll see various metrics related to your internet usage. The most important ones are “Sent Bytes” and “Received Bytes” - these show how much data you’re sending and receiving over your internet connection.\nYou can also click the “Open Resource Monitor” button at the bottom of the performance tab to get an even more detailed view of your internet usage, including which applications are using the most bandwidth.\nStep 5: Utilize third-party software for even more detailed tracking If you want to track your internet usage in even greater detail, there are several third-party software options available. A popular choice is NetWorx, which allows you to monitor your internet usage in real-time, set monthly usage limits, and even receive alerts when you’re close to your limit.\nConclusion Tracking your internet usage is an important step in understanding your online habits and making any necessary changes. With these simple steps, you can easily monitor your internet usage like a pro, and even take it a step further with third-party software options. So go ahead and start tracking - you may be surprised by what you discover!\nYou shouldn’t be bothered about your Internet usage if you are on an unlimited data plan. However, for those who are on limited plan, tracking your Internet usage could make a difference between saving or wasting few hundreds dollars of Internet bill. In addition, some ISPs do restrict your account if they think you have utilized too much of the bandwidth, so it would be helpful to find out how much bandwidth you have utilized as you surf the web.\nWindows 7 doesn’t come with a native application for you to track your Internet usage, but there are several useful and lightweight third-party apps that can easily get the job done.\n1. NetStat Live NetStat Live (NSL) is a small, easy to use TCP/IP protocol monitor which records all incoming and outgoing traffic (the bandwidth, not the data) and lets you see the exact throughput on both incoming and outgoing data. To put it simply, it measures your Internet usage and display them in a easy to read format.\nIf you noticed, NetStats Live is more than just a bandwidth monitor. It also tracks your CPU usage and show you how quickly your data goes from your computer to another computer on the Internet. So if your Internet connection is slow, you can find out which point of connection is slowing down the data transmission.\nNetSats Live\n2. tbbMeter tbbMeter is a bandwidth meter to help you monitor your Internet usage. It comes with a graph to allow you to see how much data your computer is sending to and receiving from the Internet in real time.\nThe good thing about tbbMeter is that it is highly configurable. You can change the visual style to show animated icon, scrolling graph or bar meter and get it to display the traffic for all Internet connection or only for local connection.\nThere is also plenty of test tools that you can use to test your Internet connection. My personal favorite is the Speedtest that measure how fast my Internet connection is.\nThere are many more features in tbbMeter that are not mentioned above. You really have to try it out to see how useful it is.\ntbbMeter\n3. BitMeter OS BitMeter OS is slightly different in that it is cross-platform compatible and it works from your browser rather than a standalone application.\nOnce installed and started up, it will fire up your browser and display the traffic graph in a new tab.\nThe main page shows the traffic graph, but you can also select to view the History, Summary, Query (for a specific date range) and even set a alert when your network usage goes above a certain amount.\nFor those who love a clean interface without clutter and need the ability to zoom into a specific date in the history, BitMeter OS is the one for you.\nBitMeter OS\n4. FreeMeter FreeMeter is a small and portable application that acts like a widget on your desktop. It used to be open source, but the developer took down the Open Source tag because someone took the code, rebrand it and publish it as their own. The latest version is now closed source and is only available for download on the developer’s website.\nThis application is pretty simple. It tracks your traffic usage and show them on the graph, real-time. There is no history or summary feature, but you can run the ping utility to see if a site is up. For those who need a small tool to monitor a spike in Internet usage, this is the one to go for.\nFreeMeter\n5. Bandwidth Vista If you need to know the geo-location and IP of the connection that you are making to and from, then Bandwidth Vista is the application for you. Once installed and activated, you will see a map of the world and the traffic graph at the bottom of the map. Points are placed on the map to show the countries/locations of the connection made.\nOther features of Bandwidth Vista include a ping utility and an alert function to notify you of excessive data usage.\nBandwidth Vista\nWhich is your favorite application to track Internet usage?\nImage credit: Big Stock Photo\nDamien Oh started writing tech articles since 2007 and has over 10 years of experience in the tech industry.
