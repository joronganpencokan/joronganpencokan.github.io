If you are a frequent user of Microsoft Excel, you probably know how frustrating it can be to have a spreadsheet that looks disorganized and cluttered. Fortunately, there is an easy way to solve this problem: learn how to merge and unmerge cells in just minutes!\nMerging cells is the process of combining two or more cells into one, which can be useful when you want to create a label or a title that spans multiple columns or rows. Unmerging cells is the reverse process, which separates a merged cell into individual cells.\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to merge and unmerge cells in Microsoft Excel.\nMerging Cells To merge cells in Excel, follow these simple steps:\nOpen the Excel sheet that you want to work on. Select the cells you want to merge. You can select non-adjacent cells by holding down the Ctrl key while making a selection. Click the “Merge \u0026 Center” button in the “Alignment” group on the “Home” tab. This will merge your selected cells and center the contents of the top-left cell. Merge Across If you want to merge cells horizontally instead of vertically, you can use the “Merge Across” command instead. Here’s how:\nSelect the cells you want to merge, as before. Click the small arrow next to the “Merge \u0026 Center” button, and select “Merge Across”. This will merge your selected cells and center the contents of the first cell. Unmerging Cells To unmerge cells in Excel, follow these steps:\nSelect the merged cell that you want to unmerge. Click the “Merge \u0026 Center” button to toggle it off. This will unmerge your cells and restore their individual contents. Adjust your column and row widths as needed to display the unmerged contents correctly. Tips and Tricks Here are some additional tips and tricks on merging and unmerging cells in Excel:\nIf you merge cells by mistake, use the “Undo” button or Ctrl+Z to reverse the action. When you merge cells, the formatting of the top-left cell is applied to the merged cell. Make sure this formatting matches what you want. Be careful when merging cells with data, as some information may be lost or hidden. Always double-check your results. If you want to merge cells with data without losing any information, select the cells to be merged, right-click on them, and select “Format Cells”. In the Format Cells dialog box, select the “Alignment” tab, and check the “Wrap text” checkbox. This will display all the data in the merged cell without losing any information. In conclusion, merging and unmerging cells in Excel is a powerful tool that can help you create a cleaner, more organized spreadsheet in just a few clicks. Use this hack to streamline your data and make your work much easier!\nThis article explains how to merge and unmerge cells in Excel, as well as how to find a group of merged cells in a spreadsheet.
