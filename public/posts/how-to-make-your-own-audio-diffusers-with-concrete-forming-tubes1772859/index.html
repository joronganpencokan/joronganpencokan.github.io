Look no further because we have a revolutionary DIY hack for you - create stunning audio diffusers at home with concrete forming tubes!\nAudio diffusers are specially designed to improve sound quality by scattering sound waves in various directions, creating a balanced and immersive listening experience. And with concrete forming tubes, you can create a diffractor that not only enhances sound quality but adds a design element to your room as well.\nHere’s how you can create these stunning audio diffusers at home:\nMaterials needed:\nConcrete forming tube (commonly found at hardware stores) Saw Sandpaper Drill Paint Foam or fiberglass insulation Adhesive Instructions:\nCut the concrete forming tube into equal-sized pieces. The length of the tube will depend on the size of your room, but a good rule of thumb is to create at least three to four tubes for optimal sound diffusion. Sand down the edges of the tubes to create a smooth surface for painting. Drill holes into the sides of the tubes to add depth and dimension to the sound diffusion. You can drill random holes or create a pattern for a more sophisticated look. Paint the tubes with your preferred color or design. Once the paint has dried, line the inside of the tubes with foam or fiberglass insulation. This will absorb any unwanted sound waves and enhance the overall sound quality. Use adhesive to secure the insulation to the inside of the tubes. Mount the tubes on your walls, either vertically or horizontally, depending on the design you want to create. Now sit back and enjoy the immersive audio experience that your DIY audio diffusers have provided! Not only are they functional, but they also add a unique and modern design element to your space. You can play with different colors and patterns to create a cohesive look that fits your style.\nIn conclusion, creating stunning audio diffusers at home with concrete forming tubes is a fun and cost-effective way to enhance your sound quality and add a unique design element to your space. With these easy-to-follow instructions, you can create a personalized listening experience that’s both functional and beautiful. Give it a try and let us know how it goes!\nThis article explains how to build audio diffusers for your room acoustics, based on Dr. Floyd Toole’s book, Sound Reproduction: The Acoustics and Psychoacoustics of Loudspeakers and Rooms. Diffusers reflect sound in many different directions in a room to give your home audio system’s sound a greater sense of spaciousness.\nWhat to Know\nUse concrete form tubes from a hardware or construction supply store, cut in half, place around room.Diameter matters: 24-inch diameter = more effective 1-foot thick diffuser; 14-inch = more affordable 7-inch diffuser.Choose diffuser positioning, measure and mark tubes, cut in half, nail in mounting brackets, set up against wall. The Plan The image below shows a simplified room layout according to Dr. Toole’s principles. The blue areas represent diffusers. The red areas represent foam absorbers. The diffusers and absorbers are all mounted on the wall, about 18 inches off the floor and 4 feet high. These sizes are only examples and not critical measurements for creating diffusers.\nThe materials you need to build diffusers are available in stores like Home Depot, Lowe’s, and other construction and craft supply stores.\nThe diffusers are made with concrete form tubes, cardboard tubes with walls typically about 3/8-inch thick. Home Depot sells them in sizes up to 14 inches in diameter and 4 feet in length. Construction supply stores sell them in sizes up to 2 or 3 feet in diameter, in lengths up to about 20 feet, but they’ll be happy to cut them to your preferred length.\nTo make the diffusers, you’ll need to split the tubes in half, then attach supports to mount the diffusers on the wall.\nChoosing the Diffuser’s Diameter The diameter you choose for your diffusers is important. The thicker the diffusers and the farther they stand away from the wall, the lower the frequencies they can affect. According to Toole, a geometric diffuser like the ones in this article must be 1-foot thick to be effective through the entire midrange and treble frequency range. However, 1-foot thick diffusers are bulky, and the 24-inch diameter concrete forming tubes required to make 1-foot thick diffusers are expensive.\nIf you want to make your listening room great, build 1-foot thick diffusers. If you want your room nice-looking and more affordable, use 14-inch diameter tubes available at Home Depot. The 14-inch tubes will give you 7-inch thick diffusers, still better than many of the too-thin commercially available diffusers sold by pro-audio stores.\nThis tutorial builds 8-inch thick diffusers for a back wall and 7-inch thick diffusers for sidewalls.\nDiffuser Positioning It’s a good idea to place a couple of diffusers at the “point of first reflection” on each sidewall. The point of first reflection is the place where, if you put a mirror flat on the wall, you can see the reflection of the speaker nearest that wall while you’re sitting in your favorite listening chair.\nYou can also place a couple more diffusers farther back along the sidewall. Definitely put a few along the back wall, which will minimize flutter echo.\nMeasuring for the Cut Once you have your tubes, you’ll need to split them in half. Make the cuts straight and precise so your diffusers will be flush against the wall and appear professionally made.\nThe size, shape, and layout of your room will influence your diffuser count and positioning. We used a jigsaw with a fine-tooth blade consisting of 24 teeth per inch—the finer the teeth, the smoother the cut. You can split the tube in half with a hand saw, but your cut probably won’t be as smooth or precise as with a powered jigsaw.\nTo make your cuts, measure the actual diameter of the tube. In this tutorial, the diameter is 14-1/4 inches.\nDo not use a jigsaw unless you have experience using one. Instead, ask a more skilled person to make the cuts for you. Or study the proper operation and safety practices, then practice cutting junk wood. Also, wear safety glasses and ensure other people and pets are a safe distance away when using a jigsaw.\nNext, measure half of the diameter of the tube, and mark that height on each tube. Mark the halfway point on the tube on both sides, on each end.\nBefore you make height marks, put something heavy inside the tube to ensure it won’t roll. We used an anvil—you know, like the one Wile E. Coyote used to try to drop on the Road Runner.\nMaking the Cut To make a smooth, straight cut, clamp a 1x2 stripboard on the side of the tube. Make sure to align the 1x2 stripboard with the marks you just made.\nNow, carefully cut the tube by using the 1x2 stripboard as a guide for the jigsaw. The blade is in the center of the saw, so your cut will be offset from your marks, but this is fine because you’ll have a matching offset on the other side of the tube. In this tutorial, the offset is 1-1/2 inches.\nUse high-quality 1x2 stripboards because they’re straight and almost always defect-free. In addition, it’ll be worth the extra few bucks because you’ll be cutting these up later to make your mounting brackets.\nGo nice and slow, and you’ll be rewarded with a straighter and smoother cut.\nWith one side done, unclamp the 1x2 and move it over to the other side of the tube. Now clamp it along the other marks you made, making sure to clamp it so you’ll get two even halves when you cut. If you cut the wrong side, you’ll end up with one diffuser that’s thicker than the other.\nTo make sure your line is straight, mark the distance on both sides of the half-tube, then stretch a wide strip of something like a wide fabric belt around the tube to serve as a guide to make your cut line. Then make a slow, steady, and precise cut along the mark with the jigsaw, or a hand saw.\nNailing in the Brackets The mounting brackets are part of the 1x2 strip boards you used for measuring. To make the mounting brackets, cut the boards to the same measurement as the original inside diameter of the tube. Use a miter box to ensure a straight, square cut.\nThis tutorial assumes that you want to make your diffusers 4 feet high, but if your room design or existing wall decor requires a shorter diffuser, no problem—cut them to whatever length you want.\nNail the mounting brackets as shown below. You can use two brackets on each diffuser to make the diffusers less likely to warp. Then place one bracket about one foot from each end of each diffuser.\nWe also used 1-1/2-inch wire brads (nails) with flat heads of 1/8-inch diameter, with two brads per side, per bracket. Be gentle with the hammer because the cardboard tubes can dent easily. Just make sure the brad heads are flush with the tube.\nNow mark the center point in one of the brackets and drill a 3/8-inch hole there. You need to put a hole in only one of the brackets.\nFinishing Touches Here’s where you bring your creativity to the process: decorating your diffusers.\nYou could paint the diffusers, but keep in mind they’re made like giant toilet paper tubes, with a continuous seam wrapping around the tube. You’re better off covering the tubes with some fabric, wallpaper, or almost whatever you want. Perhaps whimsical paisley fabric? Or a favorite cartoon character? It’s up to you. Just make sure the store has enough of it because you’ll be using several yards’ worth. Adding Fabric to Diffusers To apply fabric, use a spray adhesive like Loctite 200, then:\nIf you’re using a video projector, wrap your diffusers in black or dark gray felt to absorb light—the less light bouncing around your room, the better the contrast on your screen.\nCut the fabric with about 6 inches to spare on every side. Spray the surfaces of the tubes and give the adhesive half an hour to set. Trim the fabric, leaving about 2-1/2 inches excess all around. Spray the insides of the tubes on their long sides. Fold the fabric in, making a couple of quick cuts with scissors to accommodate the mounting brackets. Let the adhesive set for another half hour, then blast the inside ends of the tubes with a generous amount of adhesive. Fold in the rest of the fabric. Mounting the Diffusers If you’re OK with an amateurish but effective mounting system, hang each diffuser from a single drywall screw. The diffusers barely weigh anything, so you don’t need to worry about hitting a stud with the screw. Instead, mark where you want to mount the diffuser, put the screw in so it sticks out about 1 inch, then hang each diffuser from the hole you drilled in the back bracket.\nCut the fabric with about 6 inches to spare on every side.\nSpray the surfaces of the tubes and give the adhesive half an hour to set.\nTrim the fabric, leaving about 2-1/2 inches excess all around.\nSpray the insides of the tubes on their long sides.\nFold the fabric in, making a couple of quick cuts with scissors to accommodate the mounting brackets.\nLet the adhesive set for another half hour, then blast the inside ends of the tubes with a generous amount of adhesive.\nFold in the rest of the fabric.\nThe downside of this technique is that drywall is not very sturdy, so the diffusers can easily be torn off the wall by accidental impacts. If you need more strength, use molly anchors or toggle bolts to mount.\nCreating Legs for Diffusers If you happen to have no place to screw in any mount, you can add legs to each of the diffusers so they can stand on their own. We used the 1x2 boards to create three legs, each 24 inches long.\nWe attached the legs to the diffusers with two 1/4-inch bolts per leg so that 18 inches of leg sticks out below the diffuser.\nOther Mounting Options Suppose you don’t want to mount the diffusers on the wall or add legs to the diffusers. In that case, you can use some monofilament fishing line to hang them from the ceiling or make the diffusers 6 feet high and just let them stand on their own. There are all sorts of possibilities, and whichever way you go, you’ll have better sound with diffusions.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"2154","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Joe Hall"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-make-your-own-audio-diffusers-with-concrete-forming-tubes1772859/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionary DIY Hack - Create Stunning Audio Diffusers at Home with Concrete Forming Tubes!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 9, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2154 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Joe Hall</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#heading></a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#the-plan>The Plan</a></li><li><a href=#choosing-the-diffusers-diameter>Choosing the Diffuser&rsquo;s Diameter</a></li><li><a href=#diffuser-positioning>Diffuser Positioning</a></li><li><a href=#measuring-for-the-cut>Measuring for the Cut</a></li><li><a href=#making-the-cut>Making the Cut</a></li><li><a href=#nailing-in-the-brackets>Nailing in the Brackets</a></li><li><a href=#finishing-touches>Finishing Touches</a></li><li><a href=#adding-fabric-to-diffusers>Adding Fabric to Diffusers</a></li><li><a href=#mounting-the-diffusers>Mounting the Diffusers</a></li><li><a href=#creating-legs-for-diffusers>Creating Legs for Diffusers</a></li><li><a href=#other-mounting-options>Other Mounting Options</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Revolutionary DIY Hack - Create Stunning Audio Diffusers at Home with Concrete Forming Tubes!</p><p>Are you tired of the sound quality in your room?

If you cut the wrong side, you&rsquo;ll end up with one diffuser that&rsquo;s thicker than the other.</p><p>To make sure your line is straight, mark the distance on both sides of the half-tube, then stretch a wide strip of something like a wide fabric belt around the tube to serve as a guide to make your cut line. Then make a slow, steady, and precise cut along the mark with the jigsaw, or a hand saw.</p><h2 id=nailing-in-the-brackets>Nailing in the Brackets<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nailing-in-the-brackets>#</a></h2><p>The mounting brackets are part of the 1x2 strip boards you used for measuring. To make the mounting brackets, cut the boards to the same measurement as the original inside diameter of the tube. Use a miter box to ensure a straight, square cut.</p><p>This tutorial assumes that you want to make your diffusers 4 feet high, but if your room design or existing wall decor requires a shorter diffuser, no problem—cut them to whatever length you want.</p><p>Nail the mounting brackets as shown below. You can use two brackets on each diffuser to make the diffusers less likely to warp. Then place one bracket about one foot from each end of each diffuser.</p><p>We also used 1-1/2-inch wire brads (nails) with flat heads of 1/8-inch diameter, with two brads per side, per bracket. Be gentle with the hammer because the cardboard tubes can dent easily. Just make sure the brad heads are flush with the tube.</p><p>Now mark the center point in one of the brackets and drill a 3/8-inch hole there. You need to put a hole in only one of the brackets.</p><h2 id=finishing-touches>Finishing Touches<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#finishing-touches>#</a></h2><p>Here&rsquo;s where you bring your creativity to the process: decorating your diffusers.</p><p>You could paint the diffusers, but keep in mind they&rsquo;re made like giant toilet paper tubes, with a continuous seam wrapping around the tube. You&rsquo;re better off covering the tubes with some fabric, wallpaper, or almost whatever you want. Perhaps whimsical paisley fabric? Or a favorite cartoon character? It&rsquo;s up to you. Just make sure the store has enough of it because you&rsquo;ll be using several yards&rsquo; worth. </p><h2 id=adding-fabric-to-diffusers>Adding Fabric to Diffusers<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#adding-fabric-to-diffusers>#</a></h2><p>To apply fabric, use a spray adhesive like Loctite 200, then:</p><p>If you&rsquo;re using a video projector, wrap your diffusers in black or dark gray felt to absorb light—the less light bouncing around your room, the better the contrast on your screen.</p><ul><li>Cut the fabric with about 6 inches to spare on every side.</li><li>Spray the surfaces of the tubes and give the adhesive half an hour to set.</li><li>Trim the fabric, leaving about 2-1/2 inches excess all around.</li><li>Spray the insides of the tubes on their long sides.</li><li>Fold the fabric in, making a couple of quick cuts with scissors to accommodate the mounting brackets.</li><li>Let the adhesive set for another half hour, then blast the inside ends of the tubes with a generous amount of adhesive.</li><li>Fold in the rest of the fabric.</li></ul><h2 id=mounting-the-diffusers>Mounting the Diffusers<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#mounting-the-diffusers>#</a></h2><p>If you&rsquo;re OK with an amateurish but effective mounting system, hang each diffuser from a single drywall screw. The diffusers barely weigh anything, so you don&rsquo;t need to worry about hitting a stud with the screw. Instead, mark where you want to mount the diffuser, put the screw in so it sticks out about 1 inch, then hang each diffuser from the hole you drilled in the back bracket.</p><p>Cut the fabric with about 6 inches to spare on every side.</p><p>Spray the surfaces of the tubes and give the adhesive half an hour to set.</p><p>Trim the fabric, leaving about 2-1/2 inches excess all around.</p><p>Spray the insides of the tubes on their long sides.</p><p>Fold the fabric in, making a couple of quick cuts with scissors to accommodate the mounting brackets.</p><p>Let the adhesive set for another half hour, then blast the inside ends of the tubes with a generous amount of adhesive.</p><p>Fold in the rest of the fabric.</p><p>The downside of this technique is that drywall is not very sturdy, so the diffusers can easily be torn off the wall by accidental impacts. If you need more strength, use molly anchors or toggle bolts to mount.</p><h2 id=creating-legs-for-diffusers>Creating Legs for Diffusers<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#creating-legs-for-diffusers>#</a></h2><p>If you happen to have no place to screw in any mount, you can add legs to each of the diffusers so they can stand on their own. We used the 1x2 boards to create three legs, each 24 inches long.</p><p>We attached the legs to the diffusers with two 1/4-inch bolts per leg so that 18 inches of leg sticks out below the diffuser.</p><h2 id=other-mounting-options>Other Mounting Options<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#other-mounting-options>#</a></h2><p>Suppose you don&rsquo;t want to mount the diffusers on the wall or add legs to the diffusers. In that case, you can use some monofilament fishing line to hang them from the ceiling or make the diffusers 6 feet high and just let them stand on their own. There are all sorts of possibilities, and whichever way you go, you&rsquo;ll have better sound with diffusions.</p><p>Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-install-newer-software-in-debian-197929/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Revamp Your Debian System: Learn How To Install the Latest Software in Just a Few Clicks!</span></a>
