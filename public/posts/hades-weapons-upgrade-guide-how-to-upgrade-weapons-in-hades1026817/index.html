Master the game with our ultimate guide! If you’re a fan of action-packed, fast-paced games, you’ll undoubtedly have heard of Hades. The game’s popularity has exploded since its release in 2020, and it’s easy to see why. This rogue-like dungeon crawler has it all: stunning visuals, a gripping storyline, and challenging gameplay.\nOne of the standout features of Hades is the vast array of weapons available to players. From blades to bows, players can choose their preferred weapon, upgrade it, and unleash its power in the underworld.\nIn this article, we’ll give you a step-by-step guide to upgrading your weapons in Hades, so you can dominate the game.\nChoose Your Weapon The first step to upgrading your weapon is choosing the right one. In Hades, players can select from six primary weapons:\nStygian Blade Heart-Seeking Bow Shield of Chaos Twin Fists of Malphon Adamant Rail Exagryph Each weapon has unique abilities, ranging from dash strikes to area-of-effect attacks. Take some time to experiment with each weapon and choose the one that feels most natural to you.\nUnlock Weapon Aspects Once you’ve chosen your weapon, you’ll want to unlock its aspects. Aspects are abilities that can be upgraded using Titan Blood, a rare resource that can be found by defeating bosses.\nTo unlock new aspects, players must defeat bosses with their chosen weapon, with each boss unlocking a new aspect. Aspects can be switched out as players acquire more Titan Blood, so don’t be afraid to experiment with different combinations.\nUpgrade Your Weapon Once you’ve unlocked your weapon’s aspects, it’s time to upgrade its base statistics. To do this, players must use darkness, a resource earned by completing runs in the underworld.\nPlayers can access the weapon upgrade menu by talking to the Weapons Master in the House of Hades. Here, they can choose between using darkness to upgrade their weapon’s base stats, or using keys to unlock new abilities.\nIt’s essential to upgrade your weapon regularly as you progress through the game’s challenging levels. Increasing your weapon’s base stats will improve its damage output, making it easier to defeat tougher enemies.\nUse Boons to Strengthen Your Weapon Finally, players can use boons to augment their weapon’s abilities further. Boons are upgrades that can be obtained by sacrificing nectar or ambrosia, resources earned by interacting with characters in the House of Hades.\nEach boon has unique effects, from increasing damage output to granting additional attacks. Be sure to experiment with different boons to find the ones that synergize best with your weapon of choice.\nIn conclusion, upgrading your weapons in Hades is a straightforward process, and players can do so with a combination of Titan Blood, darkness, and boons. By leveling up your weapons, unlocking its aspects, and using boons, you’ll be able to take on even the toughest challenges thrown your way. So, what are you waiting for? Step into the underworld and become a master of Hades today!\nWeapon upgrades in Hades will not be possible until you get the Daedalus Hammer in the game. If you’re struggling to understand how to upgrade or how to find Daedalus Hammer in Hades our guide will answer all of those questions right here.\nHow To Upgrade Weapons In Hades In Hades, your weapon upgrades work a bit differently than in other games. To upgrade weapons, you will need to find a specific hammer without which upgrades are simply impossible.\nBe it luck, or lack thereof the Daedalus Hammer can be found simply by clearing out rooms and then checking out the dropped loot. The drop rate is random so there’s no estimate that you can guess about how many rooms you will need to go through to get the hammer.\nThere is another option that you can try but it will involve you finding an NPC at the Temple of Styx, the best part about it is the fact that you can purchase two hammers and both their effects will stack up.\nThe Daedalus Hammer effects each weapon differently and you will need to be a bit careful when upgrading your weapons in Hades.\nYour weapon can go from minor changes to it to completely changing how it affects the gameplay and style of the weapon. This will usually accompany a new method of how you can use the weapon for greater effect in the game.\nHowever, you cannot upgrade Zagreus’s cast in Hades as it remains unchanged no matter how many upgrades you go through with it.\nWe will be updating this guide will each weapon upgrade, so stick around or check back soon as we’ll list each weapon and how each upgrade makes it different in the game.\nThis is all there is to know about how to upgrade weapons in Hades.
