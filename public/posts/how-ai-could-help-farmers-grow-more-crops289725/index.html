Thanks to advances in technology, farmers are now able to maximize their harvest yields through the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to help them make informed decisions regarding their crops.\nAI farming technology is a revolutionary approach to agriculture that has changed the way farmers cultivate crops. Previously, farmers had to rely on their instincts and experience to make decisions regarding things like planting, watering, and fertilizing their crops. But with the introduction of AI, farmers are now able to make data-driven decisions that are more efficient, accurate, and productive.\nOne of the most significant benefits of implementing AI in farming is the ability to monitor crops remotely. With AI sensors installed throughout the farm, farmers are able to track the growth of individual plants, detect different health issues and measure factors such as soil moisture levels, temperature, and soil pH.\nAI algorithms can help predict when crops are ready to be harvested, saving farmers time and ensuring that each crop is harvested at the optimal time. These algorithms can also help monitor crop yields, estimate crop yields, and optimize irrigation to minimize water usage and reduce waste.\nAnother benefit of AI farming technology is the ability to analyze large amounts of data quickly. With AI, farmers can integrate data from various sources, such as weather forecasts, soil moisture levels, market trends, and pest control algorithms, to make informed decisions. This enables them to determine the ideal planting times, determine the best irrigation techniques, and monitor potential crop diseases.\nAI farming is also beneficial when it comes to crop management. With AI in place, it becomes easy for farmers to identify any crop diseases, how fast they are spreading, and more importantly, how to control them effectively. With this information, farmers can apply the right pesticides at the right time, ensuring that crops are protected from harmful pests and diseases.\nIn conclusion, the implementation of AI farming technology has revolutionized the agricultural industry, improving the overall efficiency of crop cultivation and ensuring maximal yields. By allowing data-driven decision-making, remote monitoring of crops, integrated analysis of data, and efficient crop management, AI technology allows farmers to increase their productivity and output while also reducing the risks associated with poorly managed crops. AI farming is a crucial step for the future of agriculture, and it is essential for any farmer who wants to stay ahead in the game.\nFarming is going high-tech, thanks to recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). John Deere is offering its first AI-powered tractor that can be operated via a smartphone app.There’s a growing movement to make farming more efficient using AI. Climate change and an increasing need for food are factors driving the move to high-tech farming. John Deere is offering its first autonomous tractor that can be operated via a smartphone app. The autonomous tractor has six pairs of stereo cameras, which enables 360-degree obstacle detection and distance calculation. It’s part of a growing movement to make farming more efficient through the use of AI.\n“AI allows farmers to precisely manage each section of the farm based on its unique conditions and needs,” Gaurav Bansal, the director of engineering and autonomy at Blue River Technology, an intelligent machine company, told Lifewire in an email interview. “This helps farmers be more efficient in deploying resources, like planting crops only where they will successfully produce food and applying nutrients and crop protectants on individual plants.”\nNot Your Parent’s Tractor Forget long days plowing the fields. To use the autonomous tractor, farmers only need to transport the machine to a desired location and configure it for autonomous operation. Using an app, they can swipe from left to right to start the machine, then leave the field to focus on other tasks while still monitoring the machine’s status from their mobile device.\nImages captured by the cameras are passed through a deep neural network that classifies each pixel in about 100 milliseconds. The AI then decides if the machine should move or stop, depending on if an obstacle is detected.\n“By being able to process data about microenvironments, agricultural robots can identify and enable the needed actions at a scope and speed beyond human capacity,” Bansal said. “There are small windows of time to complete most tasks on the farm—so this also allows farmers to make sure they’re getting done what’s needed within these small windows to maximize their yield.”\nIn our new normal where agriculture meets drought, AI is a critical learning tool for America’s specialty crop farmers.\nJohn Deere’s latest isn’t the only autonomous tractor on the market. FarmWise, for example, offers AI-driven, fully automated weeding tractors that use computer vision to identify plants, so it only pulls weeds.\n“AI is also being used for seed engineering to power automated picking robots, crop optimization, and more,” Jason Schoettler, a managing partner of Calibrate Ventures, a firm that focuses on AI and automation investments, told Lifewire via email.\nAI to the Rescue Experts say climate change and a growing need for food are additional factors driving the move to high-tech farming. The global population is expected to expand from about 8 billion to nearly 10 billion people by 2050, increasing the global food demand by 50 percent. Ceres Imaging, a California company that provides aerial imagery and AI to build irrigation management solutions for farmers, is feeling the pressure, too. John Bourne, the company’s vice president, told Lifewire in an email interview that water scarcity is creating a growing demand for Ceres products.\n“In our new normal where agriculture meets drought, AI is a critical learning tool for America’s specialty crop farmers,” Bourne said. The AI can help farmers “quickly quantify patterns of stress, often plant-specific, prioritizing corrective actions which can dramatically improve water use efficiencies, and potentially save their orchards and vineyards.”\nWith the help of AI, farmers can also analyze growing conditions—weather, water usage, soil conditions, pest and disease outbreaks—to help them make decisions throughout the growing season. This is something Intelinair, a company that uses machine learning to identify patterns in aerial imagery of fields, specializes in.\nTim Hassinger, CEO of Intelinair, explained to Lifewire via email that the company’s software can send farmers alerts to their smartphone, tablet, or desktop to see issues such as weeds, standing water, and nutrient deficiency before they harm crops. “This information helps farmers make decisions to increase operational efficiencies and improve crop yields,” Hassinger said. “Farmers can intervene, rescue yield by detecting plant disease and pests early, capture learnings for the next growing season, and identify opportunities for more sustainable farming practices…”\nAI is also helping farmers from the air. Agricultural drones with autonomous operation capabilities are gaining popularity, especially with precision spraying of pesticides, Romeo Durscher, vice president at Auterion, a drone software maker, said in an email interview. AI allows farmers to precisely manage each section of the farm based on its unique conditions and needs.\n“Oftentimes, farmers are unable to use ground vehicles on their fields after prolonged rain,” Durscher added. “Being able to fly, inspect, and then deploy many aerial vehicles loaded with pesticides to treat targeted areas cuts down on time, hard human labor, and lowers the number of pesticides being used.”\nThat said, there’s still a lot more development that needs to happen before farms are anywhere close to running themselves. Durscher said there needs to be better connectivity between the robotic units in the air and on the ground, as well as the AI and machine learning tools, which review data to make decisions on the next moves and take actions without human interaction. The AI-farming relationship can only improve from here.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1308","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-02T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jennifer Castillo"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-ai-could-help-farmers-grow-more-crops289725/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionary AI farming technology boosts harvest yields for farmers - find out how!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 2, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1308 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jennifer Castillo</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#not-your-parents-tractor>Not Your Parent’s Tractor</a></li><li><a href=#ai-to-the-rescue>AI to the Rescue</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Revolutionary AI farming technology boosts harvest yields for farmers - find out how!</p><p>The agricultural industry has come a long way since the days of manual labor and guesswork.
