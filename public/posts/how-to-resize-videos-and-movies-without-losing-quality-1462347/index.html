As the digital world expands, the need for resizing videos and movies has become increasingly important.

Similarly, you may want to resize a movie to fit your mobile device’s screen or a TV screen without losing the quality.\nWhatever your reason may be, resizing a video can be a tricky task. A poorly resized video can result in a distorted or pixelated image, ruining the overall viewing experience.\nThe Ultimate Trick The ultimate trick to resizing videos and movies like a pro is to use professional video editing software. Unlike online resizing tools or built-in video players, professional video editing software offers features that allow you to resize videos without losing quality.\nOne such software is Filmora, a powerful video editing tool for both beginners and professionals.

For instance, if you want to resize the video for Instagram, select the 1:1 aspect ratio.\nStep 5: Drag the video to fit the selected aspect ratio, ensuring that the content is not cut off.\nStep 6: Click “Export” and choose the desired format and resolution. Filmora will automatically resize the video to fit the selected format without compromising on its quality.\nConclusion Resizing videos and movies can be a daunting task, but using professional video editing software like Filmora makes it easier. With the ultimate trick, you can resize videos like a pro without compromising on the quality. Whether you’re a content creator or simply want to resize videos for personal use, give Filmora a try and see the difference it can make!\nThe bad thing is that these files take up a lot of hard drive space, and the edited videos are even bigger than the source videos. Hard drives, cloud storage space, and other storage media are used to store all the data, but everything gets worse when you want to upload that brand new movie to a video hosting service like YouTube, and it takes forever to load. How about resizing the videos to get a smaller capacity while maintaining the same quality?\nHow To Resize Videos Without Losing Quality Video editing programs are very important for every user in their attempt to make the best video that matches their vision. Users can use them to make simple operations, like cutting the video into pieces, trimming them with others, arranging the clips across the timeline, and much more, and even to do complex ones, like adding effects and filters. Also, they can be used to convert and resize videos to gain a little more free space on your hard drive or to upload them faster on your favorite websites.\nResize Videos Using Avidemux Avidemux is a free and open-source video editing application that can also be used for post-processing and many other operations. It can do cutting, encoding, filtering operations, and more while using a simple interface that beginners can easily understand. In addition, the program is compatible with almost every operating system (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux) and platform. It’s demonstrated that with proper customization settings, Avidemux can transform an 8 GB raw video to a 200 MB video without spotting any noticeable difference between them. So, don’t dawdle anymore and follow the next guide, which explains how you can use this application to resize your videos and at the same time maintain their quality:\nGo to Avidemux’s official page and download the program that corresponds with your operating system. Two mirrors are available, select one and start downloading. Begin the installation, and when you are asked which components to install (“Choose Components”), go with what it’s already been checked. When the installation is done, launch the app that can be found in the Avidemux folder from the Start menu. Now, go to the desired video and drag and drop it to the application’s workspace.\nNote that if you have more than one video, do the same operation, and you should have both videos in the timeline placed one after another. To check if everything is right, make sure that the timer has increased and that it now totalizes both videos.\nLook on the left side of the screen and find the three boxes: Video, Audio, and Format. This step is very important, so no mistakes are allowed. The first one would be to click on the drop-down menu, which is placed under the Video section, and choose the “MPEG-4 AVC” video codec. Now, under Audio, select from the drop menu the “AAC (Faac)” audio codec. Last but not the least, choose the “MP4” format. On the upper side of the screen, look for the “Save Video” icon. To be sure, just hover the pointer over the icons and see which icon is for what. Also, you must be very careful what you select because “Save Project” is not the same thing as “Save Video.” At this point, the save file prompt pops out, and you only have to name the video and select the location where you want to save it. It’s extremely important to manually introduce the MP4 extension, which means that after the name of the reduced video, you should write “.mp4”.\nNote that this operation can take a while. It all depends on the size of the initial video and the frequency of your computer’s processor. It would be best if you did not touch anything on the screen until the process is done and let the program do its job.\nResize Videos Using Handbrake Handbrake is an open-source and cross-platform video transcoder application equipped with many important features. We can remind encoding where users can change the output (bit rate, maximum file size, or bit rate), video filtering, batch encoding, and more. The program works on Mac, Windows, and Linux, which is excellent and completely free. We have made a quick tutorial where we present how to shrink videos without losing their quality:\nFirst of all, download the application that corresponds with your operating system from the official site. Secondly, launch the program and search for the “Source” button, which is placed on the upper left side of the app. Browse your files, select the desired video and click “Open.” Under the “Destination” section, click “Browse” to select the location where you want to save the new file along with its name. Also, be sure that in the output settings, the format option is set to “MP4 file”. Under the section that is grayer than the rest of the application’s interface, where five buttons are available (Video, Audio, Subtitles, Advanced, and Chapters), select “Video.” Now, go to “Target size (MB),” which is placed under “Quality,” and type in the desired file size of the compressed video. It’s very important to know that you have to follow one important rule, and that is: never shrink the videos any smaller than half of the original raw file because, for certain, the quality will be worse. Once you have done that, go to the upper side of the app and click “Start,” and the application will start compressing the video file.\nConvert to FLV format The FLV format is the de facto standard for online videos, commonly used by big websites like YouTube and Hulu. The big advantage of this kind of format is that it can halve the size of a regular video. In order to make this happen, just follow the next simple step-by-step guide:\nWe suggest using a free application which is called Free Video to Flash Converter, which can be downloaded from the DVDVideoSoft official page. The installation of the application is very simple, just follow the steps and choose where you want to install it. When the installation is complete, run the program. Press on the “Add files” button, browse to your desired video and open it. Next, pay attention to selecting the FLV format and not the SWF one. Also, select the destination for the converted video in the “Save to” area. After, go to the little button with a wand on it and press it to customize the compression settings. To maintain the same quality, select in the “Video bitrate” drop-menu a value that is between 2 MB/s and 4 MB/s, and in the “Audio bitrate,” choose a value that is around 192 Kb/s. Also, you could drop the 1080p resolution to 720p from the same place to shrink the final video’s size even more. Now, just press “Convert” and wait until the process is done. You will see that the quality is the same and the size is up to 50% smaller.\nResize Videos Using VirtualDub VirtualDub is a Windows video capture and processing application that operates on AVI movies. It can also be used on Mac OS and Linux by installing and using a special application that permits users to run specially designed apps for Windows on Unix-like operating systems. The application is called Wine and can be downloaded for free from here. In order to compress your videos without losing quality, read the next guide:\nDownload and install the application from here. Also, in order to be sure that the application works properly, you need to install K-Lite Codec Mega Pack, which can be downloaded from here. Download and install VirtualDub. Next, run the app and open the desired video in it. Now, go to “Video” and select “Compression.” Also, you can type the CTRL+P combination from your keyboard to do the same thing. A menu will appear and from its left side, select “Xvid MPEG-4 Codec” from the video compression list. Click OK and go to “File,” and select “Save as.” Now, VirtualDub will compress the video but, at the same time, will maintain the original quality.\nAlso, you could try other tricks like:\nCutting the extra space from the 16:9 videos if you intend to use for your video a 4:3 aspect. To do this, you can use the movavi or the Wondershare Video Editor application. Changing the quality of the video to a lower resolution because will save a lot of space on your hard drive. Note that the differences between 1080p and 720p aren’t so visible. You could do this with just simple steps using a simple converter (Free Video Converter or Online Video Converter which is a completely free and online solution). Also, try to convert to other video and other compression formats.\nResize Videos Online with Type Studio If you don’t want to bother about downloading and installing different software, you can easily resize videos online with apps like Type Studio. Here is how to do it.\nEnsure you have a good quality Internet connection.\nSign up and login to Type Studio.\nOnce you are logged in, upload your video to the project page.\nOn the left side, you will find the auto-generated transcript. If there are some spelling mistakes, you can easily correct the transcript. The right side, the video canvas, is now important for resizing your video or, for example, rotating your video.\nTo resize your video, you have to hover above the video and grab one of the appearing corner points. While grabbing, move your mouse to the left or the right and scale your video.\nIf you want to change the format/aspect ratio, you can do that as well. To change the format, click on the button right above your video inside of Type Studio and choose from one of the formats – Original, Square, Landscape, Portrait, Horizontal Post, Vertical Post, and Pinterest.\nOnce done, simply export the resized video by hitting the export button.\n","wordCount":"2096","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-14T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jannie Marcinkowski"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-resize-videos-and-movies-without-losing-quality-1462347/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Discover the Ultimate Trick to Resize Videos and Movies Like a Pro – No Compromise on Quality!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 14, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2096 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jannie Marcinkowski</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#the-need-for-resizing-videos-and-movies>The Need for Resizing Videos and Movies</a></li><li><a href=#the-ultimate-trick>The Ultimate Trick</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-resize-videos-without-losing-quality>How To Resize Videos Without Losing Quality</a><ul><li><a href=#resize-videos-using-avidemux>Resize Videos Using Avidemux</a></li><li><a href=#resize-videos-using-handbrake>Resize Videos Using Handbrake</a></li><li><a href=#convert-to-flv-format>Convert to FLV format</a></li><li><a href=#resize-videos-using-virtualdub>Resize Videos Using VirtualDub</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#resize-videos-online-with-type-studio>Resize Videos Online with Type Studio</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=discover-the-ultimate-trick-to-resize-videos-and-movies-like-a-pro--no-compromise-on-quality>Discover the Ultimate Trick to Resize Videos and Movies Like a Pro – No Compromise on Quality!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#discover-the-ultimate-trick-to-resize-videos-and-movies-like-a-pro--no-compromise-on-quality>#</a></h1><p>As the digital world expands, the need for resizing videos and movies has become increasingly important.

The installation of the application is very simple, just follow the steps and choose where you want to install it. When the installation is complete, run the program.
Press on the “Add files” button, browse to your desired video and open it.
Next, pay attention to selecting the FLV format and not the SWF one. Also, select the destination for the converted video in the “Save to” area.
After, go to the little button with a wand on it and press it to customize the compression settings. To maintain the same quality, select in the “Video bitrate” drop-menu a value that is between 2 MB/s and 4 MB/s, and in the “Audio bitrate,” choose a value that is around 192 Kb/s. Also, you could drop the 1080p resolution to 720p from the same place to shrink the final video’s size even more.
Now, just press “Convert” and wait until the process is done. You will see that the quality is the same and the size is up to 50% smaller.</p><h3 id=resize-videos-using-virtualdub>Resize Videos Using VirtualDub<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#resize-videos-using-virtualdub>#</a></h3><p>VirtualDub is a Windows video capture and processing application that operates on AVI movies. It can also be used on Mac OS and Linux by installing and using a special application that permits users to run specially designed apps for Windows on Unix-like operating systems. The application is called Wine and can be downloaded for free from here.
In order to compress your videos without losing quality, read the next guide:</p><p>Download and install the application from here. Also, in order to be sure that the application works properly, you need to install K-Lite Codec Mega Pack, which can be downloaded from here.
Download and install VirtualDub. Next, run the app and open the desired video in it.
Now, go to “Video” and select “Compression.” Also, you can type the CTRL+P combination from your keyboard to do the same thing.
A menu will appear and from its left side, select “Xvid MPEG-4 Codec” from the video compression list.
Click OK and go to “File,” and select “Save as.” Now, VirtualDub will compress the video but, at the same time, will maintain the original quality.</p><p>Also, you could try other tricks like:</p><p>Cutting the extra space from the 16:9 videos if you intend to use for your video a 4:3 aspect. To do this, you can use the movavi or the Wondershare Video Editor application.
Changing the quality of the video to a lower resolution because will save a lot of space on your hard drive. Note that the differences between 1080p and 720p aren’t so visible. You could do this with just simple steps using a simple converter (Free Video Converter or Online Video Converter which is a completely free and online solution).
 Also, try to convert to other video and other compression formats.</p><h2 id=resize-videos-online-with-type-studio>Resize Videos Online with Type Studio<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#resize-videos-online-with-type-studio>#</a></h2><p>If you don’t want to bother about downloading and installing different software, you can easily resize videos online with apps like Type Studio.
