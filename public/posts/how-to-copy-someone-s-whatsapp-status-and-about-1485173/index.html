Or perhaps you want to spy on a romantic interest and see what their “about” information reveals about their personality or interests. Whatever your reason, you may be surprised to learn that it’s easier than you think to steal anyone’s WhatsApp status and about info in just five simple steps.\nStep 1: Know the phone number of the person whose status and about info you want to see.\nIf you don’t already have the person’s phone number saved in your contacts, you’ll need to find out what it is. This can be done by asking the person directly, checking social media profiles or online directories, or using specialized phone number lookup services.\nStep 2: Download and install a spy app or WhatsApp hacking tool.\nThere are many third-party apps and websites that claim to allow you to hack into someone’s WhatsApp account and view their status and about info. However, many of these tools are illegal or fraudulent, and may infect your device with malware or steal your personal information. Do your research and only use reputable, trusted tools that have a proven track record of success and good user reviews.\nStep 3: Enter the phone number and wait for verification.\nMost spy apps and WhatsApp hacking tools will require you to enter the phone number of the person whose account you want to hack. Once you have entered the number, the tool will attempt to verify the account by sending a code to the person’s phone. You may need to wait a few minutes for the verification code to arrive.\nStep 4: Access the person’s WhatsApp account.\nOnce the account has been verified, you should be able to access the person’s WhatsApp account using the spy app or hacking tool. From there, you can view their status and about info, as well as their chat history, photos, and other personal data.\nStep 5: Be careful and respectful with the information you discover.\nWhile it may be tempting to use the information you discover for malicious purposes, it’s important to remember that privacy is a basic human right. If you feel uncomfortable or guilty about what you have done, you may want to consider confessing to the person or seeking therapy or support to deal with your emotions. On the other hand, if you discover something that raises serious concerns, such as evidence of criminal activity or mental health issues, you may have a moral obligation to report it to the appropriate authorities.\nIn conclusion, stealing someone’s WhatsApp status and about info may seem like an easy and harmless way to satisfy your curiosity or gain an advantage, but it can have serious consequences for both you and the other person. It’s important to weigh the pros and cons carefully before deciding whether to take such a drastic step, and to proceed with caution and respect if you do. Always remember that everyone deserves to have their privacy respected, and that violating that privacy can have long-lasting negative effects.\nSometimes our WhatsApp contacts put such an amazing video, image, or text as their stories that we wish to put it as our own WhatsApp status.\nYou might be wondering that what’s the need to copy About, it can be simply rewritten.\nBut what if “About” contains special symbols which are not available on your smartphone’s soft keyboard? Then the only choice you are left with is to copy their status.\nHowever, regarding video and image, you’ll have to download their status media before using it in your story. And we already know that there is no direct way to download media from your friends’ stories on WhatsApp.\nSo in this article, we will help you out to copy someone’s WhatsApp Status image, video, and “About” on Android. However, on the iPhone, you can only copy the WhatsApp “About” of your friend. Here’s how to do it.\nDon’t Miss: How To Put Blank WhatsApp Status\nCopying Others WhatsApp Status Having Video Or Image Copying your friend’s WhatsApp status isn’t that easy and requires some work. And that work includes downloading a third-party app. However, after downloading the app, copying someone’s WhatsApp image and video status gets much easier. So if you are comfortable downloading the required app, then you can follow the steps given below.\nFirst, install the app – Status Saver on your smartphone.\nNow, launch the app. You’ll see the current media status of your contacts divided into 2 tabs. Images tab will include Image status, while the Videos tab will include only Video status.\nTap on any image or a video to open it.\nNow that you’re on that particular media, you’ll see a + icon on the bottom right corner of the screen. Tap on it.\nA list of different options will appear. Tap on the “Repost” Option. (Note: You can also tap on the “Share” option and then select WhatsApp to set the image as your status.)\nThat’s it, now it will directly take you to WhatsApp. Just tap on My status to set the media as your own status.\nSo now you can easily copy the image or video status of your contacts through this app. Moreover, using this app you can also download the WhatsApp status of others on your phone apart from setting them as your status.\nAlternative If due to some reason, the previous app didn’t work well on your smartphone, then you can also use an alternative app – Status Story Saver for WhatsApp. This app works exactly like the last app with an almost similar interface. But with this app, the constant ads are a little bit of problem.\nCopy WhatsApp About On iPhone On iPhone head over to someone’s WhatsApp profile and long tap on About.\nA Copy option will pop up, tap on it to copy. After this, you can paste this status on your WhatsApp status or About.\nThis feature copies all special symbols and smilies also.\nCopy WhatsApp About On Android Unlike iOS, the feature to directly copy anyone’s WhatsApp About is not available on Android. Here we will have to use the WhatsApp web.\nFirst, Open WhatsApp Web on the web browser using your PC.\nNow launch WhatsApp App on your phone.\nAs you’re now on WhatsApp on your phone, tap on the three dots icon at the top right corner of the screen.\nFrom the list of options, select “WhatsApp Web.”\nNow you have to scan the code available on WhatsApp web site on your PC using your phone.\nAfter successfully scanning the code, you’ll be able to use your WhatsApp account on the PC.\nNext, open the chat of the user whose About you want to copy.\nAfter that, click on the name of that user to see his/her contact info.\nNow, take the cursor over the user’s About and right-click on it.\nYou’ll now see a bunch of options, click on “Inspect.”\nAfter this, double click on their status to be able to copy it.\nAs soon as you’re done copying the status, click on your profile icon at the top left corner of the screen.\nNow paste the status into your About section on WhatsApp. That’s it; you can even copy special symbols and smilies with this method.\nIt’s very easy to copy someone’s WhatsApp About on iOS than Android. However, WhatsApp may bring this option for Android sometime in the future.\nDon’t Miss: How To Upload WhatsApp Status From Gallery Or Camera Roll\nWrapping Up Putting text or media status on WhatsApp has become a daily part of our life. And sometimes all we want to do is copy the status of our friends, which isn’t directly possible. But after going through this article, you’ll easily be able to do that. Although you’ll have to keep the required app on your phone if you are someone who copies WhatsApp status quite constantly.\n","wordCount":"1356","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-05T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-05T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"David Pitonyak"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-copy-someone-s-whatsapp-status-and-about-1485173/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Steal Anyone's Whatsapp Status & About Info in Just 5 Simple Steps - You Won't Believe How Easy It Is!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-05 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 5, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1356 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;David Pitonyak</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#copying-others-whatsapp-status-having-video-or-image>Copying Others WhatsApp Status Having Video Or Image</a><ul><li><a href=#alternative>Alternative</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#copy-whatsapp-about-on-iphone>Copy WhatsApp About On iPhone</a><ul><li><a href=#copy-whatsapp-about-on-android>Copy WhatsApp About On Android</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#wrapping-up>Wrapping Up</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Title: Steal Anyone&rsquo;s Whatsapp Status & About Info in Just 5 Simple Steps - You Won&rsquo;t Believe How Easy It Is!</p><p>Are you curious about what your friends or acquaintances have written as their WhatsApp status, but feel too shy or awkward to ask?
