If you’re a fan of Blox Fruits, you know that the game is all about finding and collecting fruits that give you unique abilities to help you in your journey. But sometimes, it can be tough to come across some of the rarest species that are most desired. Fear not, as we have some tips and tricks to help you unlock the secret to obtaining these rare fruits!\nTip #1: Take Advantage of Quests One of the primary ways to earn fruits in Blox Fruits is through quests. And while some of these may seem trivial or basic, it’s essential to take advantage of them all. Often the missions that give you the rarest fruits are the most challenging to complete, but the rewards are often worth it.\nOne good example is the Gum Gum Fruit quest, where you need to defeat 150 enemies within 10 minutes to get the fruit’s essence. This fruit is not only one of the most iconic fruits in the game but also one of the rarest.\nTip #2: Keep an Eye on the in-game market Blox Fruits has an in-game market where players can buy and sell fruits. While buying fruits can be costly, it does provide an opportunity for you to obtain rare fruits that you wouldn’t otherwise have access to. Additionally, by keeping an eye on the prices of specific fruits, you can get an idea of which ones are rarer and how much they are worth.\nTip #3: Complete Secret Missions Another way to obtain rare fruits is through secret missions. These missions are often not visible on the map and require you to discover their whereabouts by exploring the game. Completing these missions is often difficult but also rewarding.\nOne example is the Dragon Fruit quest, which requires you to bring all the dragon artifacts scattered throughout the game to their specific location. Completing this quest rewards you with the Dragon Fruit, which is known to be one of the rarest and most potent fruits in existence.\nTip #4: Trade with other players One final option for obtaining rare fruits is through trades with other players. The Blox Fruits community is vast, and everyone is always on the hunt for a specific fruit they don’t already have. By trading with others, you can get your hands on a rare fruit that someone else may have already obtained.\nConclusion Unlocking the secret to obtaining rare fruits in Blox Fruits may seem like a daunting task, but with a little strategy, it’s entirely obtainable. By taking advantage of quests, keeping an eye on the in-game market, completing secret missions, and trading with others, you’ll be able to get your hands on rare fruit in no time.

Blox Fruits are essential for the players who focus on building Fruit mains. Players can obtain Fruit in many ways one of the most common ways of obtaining them is by buying Physical Fruit from Blox Fruit Dealer or Blox Fruit Dealer Cousin or Advanced Blox Fruit Dealer which costs Robux or Belli.

Blox Fruit Dealer Cousin on the other hand provides a random Fruit in exchange for Belli. The price depends on the level of the player. You must have a minimum level of 50 to buy a random Fruit from him. Also, he gives Fruits at discounted prices for premium users. Advanced Blox Fruit Dealer is only available on Mirage island.
