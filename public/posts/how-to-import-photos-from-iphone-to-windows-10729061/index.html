You can also, of course, transfer photos from an iPhone to a Mac as well.\nHow to Import Photos From iPhone to PC With OneDrive By far, the easiest way to download pictures from iPhone to a computer is to use a cloud service such as Microsoft’s OneDrive. After the initial setup, this method will allow your iPhone to wirelessly sync all of your iPhone photos and videos to your Windows 10 computer automatically, so you won’t have to worry about connecting any cables or manually copying files.\nAfter you’ve installed the OneDrive app on your iPhone, open it and tap Allow Access to All Photos. OneDrive comes automatically installed on most Windows 10 devices so you don’t need to download it for your computer. Log into OneDrive with the same Microsoft account you use on your Windows 10 PC and tap your profile photo in the top-left corner. You may be automatically logged into OneDrive if you use other Microsoft services or apps on your iPhone such as Microsoft Teams or Word. Tap Settings. Tap Camera Upload. Tap the switch to turn on the Camera Upload feature. Disable Use Mobile Network if you need to save data and want media uploaded when connected to Wi-Fi. Enable Include Videos if you want videos you record on your iPhone transferred to your PC as well. Your photos, and videos if selected, should now begin uploading to Microsoft’s OneDrive servers. They will then download onto your connected Windows 10 device as soon as it’s turned on and connected to the internet. Your downloaded media should be available within the OneDrive \u003e Pictures \u003e Camera Roll folder on your PC once the sync is complete. How to Download Pictures From iPhone to Computer With the Photos App Another common way to import pictures from iPhone to Windows 10 is to use the native Windows 10 Photos app. It can be a bit fiddly at first, though, as it requires you to download and install the iTunes app and register your iPhone within iTunes before your computer can read the contents of your iPhone’s storage.\nAfter you’ve installed the OneDrive app on your iPhone, open it and tap Allow Access to All Photos.\nOneDrive comes automatically installed on most Windows 10 devices so you don’t need to download it for your computer.\nLog into OneDrive with the same Microsoft account you use on your Windows 10 PC and tap your profile photo in the top-left corner.\nYou may be automatically logged into OneDrive if you use other Microsoft services or apps on your iPhone such as Microsoft Teams or Word.\nTap Settings.\nTap Camera Upload.\nTap the switch to turn on the Camera Upload feature.\nDisable Use Mobile Network if you need to save data and want media uploaded when connected to Wi-Fi. Enable Include Videos if you want videos you record on your iPhone transferred to your PC as well.\nYour photos, and videos if selected, should now begin uploading to Microsoft’s OneDrive servers. They will then download onto your connected Windows 10 device as soon as it’s turned on and connected to the internet.\nYour downloaded media should be available within the OneDrive \u003e Pictures \u003e Camera Roll folder on your PC once the sync is complete.\nWhile OneDrive is convenient due to it being pre-installed with the Windows 10 operating system, many other cloud services, such as Dropbox, also offer camera upload functions from their mobile apps that work in much the same way.\nHere’s how to transfer photos from an iPhone to a computer with the Windows 10 Photos app.\nIf you haven’t yet, download and install the free iTunes app on your Windows 10 device, connect your iPhone to your PC via USB with iTunes open, and register your smartphone following the instructions shown on the screen. You’ll only need to do this iTunes/iPhone setup process once. Open the Windows 10 Photos app. Click Import. Click From a connected device. If you get an error message in Photos, re-open iTunes and make sure you’re logged in with your Apple ID. The Photos app will begin scanning your iPhone for media to transfer to your PC. The app may take several minutes to find the pictures and videos on your iPhone; once it discovers the first few, it will quickly scan the rest. Select all of the photos on your iPhone you want to copy to your Windows 10 device. If you want to delete them from your iPhone after they’re copied to your PC, check the box next to Delete the original items after import. When you’re ready to begin the transfer, click Import. Once your photos have been transferred from your iPhone to your computer, you’ll be shown a message informing you the process has been completed. The message will show a link to the photos’ location on your computer, which you can use to view them with Windows 10’s File Explorer, but the Photos app will also show all of your imported media. How to Transfer Photos From iPhone to Computer via File Explorer If you don’t like using the Photos app, you can also download pictures from your iPhone to your computer using the basic Windows 10 File Explorer tool you typically use to browse folders on your device.\nIf you haven’t yet, download and install the free iTunes app on your Windows 10 device, connect your iPhone to your PC via USB with iTunes open, and register your smartphone following the instructions shown on the screen.\nYou’ll only need to do this iTunes/iPhone setup process once.\nOpen the Windows 10 Photos app.\nClick Import.\nClick From a connected device.\nIf you get an error message in Photos, re-open iTunes and make sure you’re logged in with your Apple ID.\nThe Photos app will begin scanning your iPhone for media to transfer to your PC.\nThe app may take several minutes to find the pictures and videos on your iPhone; once it discovers the first few, it will quickly scan the rest.\nSelect all of the photos on your iPhone you want to copy to your Windows 10 device.\nIf you want to delete them from your iPhone after they’re copied to your PC, check the box next to Delete the original items after import.\nWhen you’re ready to begin the transfer, click Import.\nOnce your photos have been transferred from your iPhone to your computer, you’ll be shown a message informing you the process has been completed.\nThe message will show a link to the photos’ location on your computer, which you can use to view them with Windows 10’s File Explorer, but the Photos app will also show all of your imported media.\nOnce you’ve installed and set up iTunes, open File Explorer, which you can access via the Documents link in the Start Menu and navigate to This PC \u003e Apple iPhone \u003e Internal Storage \u003e DCIM to access your pictures and videos.\nAs with the Photos app method shown above, you will need to download and install the free iTunes app and connect your iPhone to it before your Windows 10 device can read your smartphone’s contents.\nYour iPhone photos may be in multiple folders, but all you need to do now is find the ones you want and copy them to another folder on your Windows 10 PC.\nImport Pictures From iPhone to Windows 10 Using Email and Messaging Apps If you’re not a fan of cloud services or don’t feel like downloading any additional apps, you can still transfer photos from an iPhone to a computer the old-fashioned way by using email.\nAll you need to do is compose an email on your iPhone, make sure to attach your photos to it, send the email to yourself, and then check the email on your Windows 10 computer.\nAnother alternative is to add your photos to a conversation in an iPhone chat app and open it in the Windows 10 version on your computer. Once you open the conversation on your PC, you can download all of the images in it.\nYou can send emails from and to the same email address. You don’t need to worry about managing multiple accounts to transfer your photos this way.\nApps such as WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger have Windows 10 versions free to download. However, most services also have web versions that you can access from any browser.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1853","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anna Maurer"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-import-photos-from-iphone-to-windows-10729061/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Secret Hack Revealed: Effortlessly Transfer Your iPhone Photos to Windows 10 with Just One Click!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 4, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1853 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Anna Maurer</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#how-to-import-photos-from-iphone-to-pc-with-onedrive>How to Import Photos From iPhone to PC With OneDrive</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-download-pictures-from-iphone-to-computer-with-the-photos-app>How to Download Pictures From iPhone to Computer With the Photos App</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-computer-via-file-explorer>How to Transfer Photos From iPhone to Computer via File Explorer</a></li><li><a href=#import-pictures-from-iphone-to-windows-10-using-email-and-messaging-apps>Import Pictures From iPhone to Windows 10 Using Email and Messaging Apps</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Secret Hack Revealed: Effortlessly Transfer Your iPhone Photos to Windows 10 with Just One Click!</p><p>Are you tired of the hassle involved in transferring your iPhone photos to your Windows 10 PC?
