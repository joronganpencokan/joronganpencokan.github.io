Here’s the secret hack to unlock the ultimate Mac experience without buying one: virtual machines. In this article, we will explore what virtual machines are and how you can set up one to learn MacOS on a Windows or Linux machine with ease.\nSection 1: What are virtual machines?\nA virtual machine enables you to run an operating system within another system. It is a software that creates a virtual environment that emulates a physical computer’s capabilities, including CPU, memory, storage, and other components. Therefore, you can install any operating system within a virtual machine, including Windows, Linux, MacOS, and more. This means that you can run MacOS on a virtual machine installed on a Windows or Linux machine.\nSection 2: Why use a virtual machine to learn MacOS?\nOne of the significant advantages of using a virtual machine is that you can install and test different operating systems without buying new hardware, which can be costly. For instance, if you want to learn MacOS, it requires purchasing a Mac, which can set you back a considerable amount, especially if you’re only using it for learning purposes. A virtual machine, on the other hand, is entirely free and can be set up within minutes.\nAdditionally, virtual machines are safe and secure as they are isolated from your host system. In case something goes wrong with the virtual machine, it won’t affect the host system, and you can easily reset or reinstall it.\nSection 3: How to set up a virtual machine\nSetting up a virtual machine may sound technical, but it’s relatively simple, and you only need a few tools. Here’s how to set up a virtual machine:\nStep 1: Download and install VirtualBox or VMware, which are popular virtual machine software. Both tools are free, and you can choose one based on your preference.\nStep 2: Download the MacOS ISO image file, which contains the operating system’s installation files. You can find the MacOS ISO file online easily.\nStep 3: Create a new virtual machine by opening VirtualBox or VMware and following the prompts to create a new virtual machine. You’ll be required to allocate memory and storage space, and other system settings.\nStep 4: Install the MacOS operating system. Once you’ve created the virtual machine, you can start the installation process by following the prompts just like you would on a physical Mac.\nStep 5: Enjoy your MacOS virtual machine! Once the installation process is complete, you’ll have a fully functioning MacOS virtual machine that you can use to explore and learn the operating system at your leisure.\nConclusion:\nLearning MacOS has never been easier, thanks to virtual machines. With VirtualBox or VMware, you can set up a MacOS virtual machine on your Windows or Linux machine and start exploring the operating system without spending any money on hardware. Virtual machines are safe, secure, and easy to use, so don’t hesitate to give it a try today!\nThe Mac vs. PC battle has raged for decades, and through it all, computer shoppers have been provided with two very strong options. Choosing one or the other often comes down to personal taste, work needs, price, etc. Perhaps the biggest strength of Apple is that it designs its own software and hardware, giving the company end-to-end control over performance. That fact alone has led many to dive headfirst into the Mac camp. Seamless operation is just one of the many reasons buying a Mac can be right for you. However, if you are not sure and want to try before you buy, there are ways to do that.\nThe Apple Store Apple’s retail footprint has grown tremendously over the years and for very good reasons. The Apple store is an experience all its own, full of nearly every product Apple produces. However, the best reason to visit the Apple store is not to interact with the staff but to get to know the products they sell.\nThe MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac Mini, and iMac are all on display. They are all fully operational, allowing you to surf the Web, check your email or just explore the system itself. There’s no time limit, so you can pull up a stool and explore to your heart’s content.\nWhen the time comes that you do need help, Apple’s dedicated staff is standing by. Do you want to learn how to set up a printer? Just ask one of the staff members. Want to learn how to find new apps using the Mac App Store? Just ask.\nAnd if you’ve made your selection and decided to take a new Apple computer home, there are free classes at every Apple store to help you get started. These introductory classes will help you learn how to navigate system preferences, set up your email and browse the web with Safari.\nApple.com Website Much like the Apple store itself, Apple’s website is littered with guides and helpful tips. Your first destination should be its dedicated user guide page. It’s here that you’ll learn what’s possible with the newest operating system, Mojave (and soon Catalina). There are guides to help you understand how the whole family can share one computer, including music, books and email.\nIf you want to see what’s possible so you can customize your future Apple computer and make it your own, there’s a guide for that, too. Learning how to use features like Spotlight, Siri or notification center are all musts, and there’s a walkthrough for each. By now it should be clear that Apple’s website is a tremendous asset to understanding if macOS is right for you. If you think it’s something you want to learn about, there’s a great chance that Apple.com already has a dedicated page just for you.\nYouTube If there’s one site that’s not Apple related but can help you learn how to use a Mac, it’s YouTube. The depth of resource videos available here is just enormous. There are thousands of instructional videos that will help you learn nearly every facet of owning a Mac.\nIf you can’t make it to a Best Buy or Apple Store to try the computers in person, YouTube is the next best thing. Videos like this 45-minute tutorial by YouTuber David Cox walks you through the operating system from start to finish. It will show you the basics of what’s possible on the Mac, including how to use the Apple menu, Finder basics and system preferences. Videos like these can rival just about anything you can learn on your own.\nInstall macOS in Virtual Machine If you are technically inclined and like getting your hands dirty, then installing macOS in a virtual machine is the best way to try macOS without getting a Mac. One thing is that installing macOS on a virtual machine is not as simple as installing Linux and Windows, and you are bound to meet with drivers issues, but that will give you the chance to learn about the technical aspects of macOS before you get your own Mac.\nConclusion Whether it’s visiting the Apple store or exploring YouTube, you’re going to learn a whole lot about macOS. Armed with that knowledge, your future buying decision will be so much easier. Sound off below on how you first learned about macOS?\nDavid is a freelance tech writer with over 15 years of experience in the tech industry.
