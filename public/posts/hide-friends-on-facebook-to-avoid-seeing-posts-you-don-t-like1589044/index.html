It’s a great way to keep in touch with friends and family across the globe, and it’s also an excellent source of news and entertainment. However, sometimes, your Facebook feed can become cluttered with posts from friends who you would rather not hear from. Maybe it’s a high school acquaintance who posts too many political opinions or that coworker who can’t stop sharing spoilers for your favorite TV shows. Whatever the case may be, Facebook has a simple trick that can help you clean up your feed and eliminate those annoying friends.\nThe trick is called “unfollow.” When you unfollow someone on Facebook, you remain friends with them, but their posts will no longer appear in your news feed. This means that you can still visit their profile whenever you want, but you won’t have to see their posts cluttering up your feed.\nUnfollowing someone is incredibly easy. Here’s how to do it:\nFind the person you want to unfollow in your Facebook feed.\nHover over their name or their profile picture.\nClick on the three dots that appear in the top right corner of their profile picture.\nSelect the “unfollow” option from the dropdown menu.\nThat’s it! You’ve successfully unfollowed someone on Facebook. You won’t see their posts in your news feed anymore, and they won’t be notified that you’ve unfollowed them.\nOf course, you might be wondering if unfollowing someone is a little bit rude. After all, won’t they notice that you’re not liking their posts or commenting on their updates anymore? The truth is, probably not. Most people have hundreds of friends on Facebook, and they’re not actively keeping track of who is interacting with their posts. Plus, if you’re not enjoying someone’s content, it’s better to unfollow them than to continue to subject yourself to posts that irritate or upset you.\nThere are a few other things to keep in mind when using the unfollow feature on Facebook. For example, if someone tags you in a post or a photo, you’ll still see that content (assuming you haven’t turned off notifications for that person altogether). Additionally, if the person you’ve unfollowed is part of a group or event that you’re also a member of, you’ll still see their posts in those contexts.\nIn conclusion, the unfollow feature on Facebook is an excellent way to clean up your news feed and eliminate posts from people who you’d rather not hear from. It’s a simple yet effective way to personalize your Facebook experience and ensure that you’re only seeing the content that you enjoy. So go ahead and try it out – you might be surprised at how much more enjoyable your Facebook browsing becomes!\nHiding someone on Facebook is a skill that’s worth learning because it reduces the uninteresting status updates in your news feed. When you hide a friend, it means that you are hiding what they write so that it doesn’t show in your news feed. You remain Facebook friends and can message each other at any time.\nHow Do You Hide a Facebook Friend? There are three ways to hide friends and pages from your news feed:\nHide Post: Hide a specific post from your news feed. You won’t see it again.Snooze for 30 Days: Don’t see posts from a friend for 30 days.Unfollow: Only see a friend’s status updates if you go to their timeline, not in your news feed. Hide a Specific Post What can you do to avoid repeatedly seeing a post that makes your flesh crawl, or one that you don’t want to see in your feed, for any reason? Hide it.\nIn your news feed, select the three horizontal dots in the upper-right corner of the post you want to hide. Then, select Hide post. It won’t show in your feed again.\nHide a Friend by Snoozing Them for 30 Days Some Facebook friends post too much, and you get tired of seeing their status updates. You can block their posts from showing up in your news feed for 30 days. You may find that you miss their updates when the 30 days are up. If not, you can snooze them for another 30 days.\nIn your news feed, select the three horizontal dots at the top of a post from a friend you want to snooze. Then, select Snooze Name for 30 days, where Name is the name of the friend you want to snooze, or unfollow, for 30 days.\nUnfollow Friends From Your News Feed You can unfollow someone completely, which means you won’t see any of their status updates in your news feed unless you decide to follow them.\nIn your news feed, select the three horizontal dots at the top of a post from a friend you want to unfollow. Select Unfollow Name, where Name is the name of the friend you wish to unfollow.\nUnfollow Friends From Their Profile Page You can also unfollow a friend or a page by going to their profile page. On their profile page, select the person icon and select Unfollow in the drop-down menu.\nTo unfollow someone does not mean you are unfriending them. It means you won’t see their status updates in your news feed.\nIs Unfriending Easier? You may think it’s easier to unfriend someone than hide them from your timeline, but it is not. Hiding is a two-step process that you can do from your news feed, while unfriending is a three-step process that requires you to go to the person’s profile page or timeline.\nBe careful not to tap Unfriend accidentally, as it is right below Unfollow.\nWhile there’s a lot of debate over Facebook addiction and the value of a Facebook friendship, there are many benefits to maintaining those electronic connections.\nWhen you hide certain friends, pages, and posts, you can feel comfortable staying connected to your many acquaintances and friends on Facebook.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1013","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Terry Mora"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/hide-friends-on-facebook-to-avoid-seeing-posts-you-don-t-like1589044/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionize Your Facebook Feed With This Simple Trick To Hide Annoying Friends!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 24, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1013 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Terry Mora</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#how-do-you-hide-a-facebook-friend>How Do You Hide a Facebook Friend?</a></li><li><a href=#hide-a-specific-post>Hide a Specific Post</a></li><li><a href=#hide-a-friend-by-snoozing-them-for-30-days>Hide a Friend by Snoozing Them for 30 Days</a></li><li><a href=#unfollow-friends-from-your-news-feed>Unfollow Friends From Your News Feed</a></li><li><a href=#unfollow-friends-from-their-profile-page>Unfollow Friends From Their Profile Page</a></li><li><a href=#is-unfriending-easier>Is Unfriending Easier?</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Revolutionize Your Facebook Feed With This Simple Trick To Hide Annoying Friends!</p><p>Facebook is undoubtedly one of the most popular social media platforms out there.
