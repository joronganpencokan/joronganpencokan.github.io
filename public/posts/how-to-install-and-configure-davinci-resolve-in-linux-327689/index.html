Not only is it a top-of-the-line editing suite that can handle everything from basic cuts to complex visual effects, but it’s also available for free!\nHowever, getting DaVinci Resolve up and running on Linux can be a bit of a challenge. Fortunately, with a bit of technical know-how, you can unleash your inner Spielberg and start creating stunning videos in no time.\nHere’s a step-by-step guide to installing and configuring DaVinci Resolve on Linux.\nStep 1: Check System Requirements\nThe first thing you need to do is make sure your system can handle DaVinci Resolve. The minimum hardware requirements are as follows:\nCPU: Intel i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 GPU: NVIDIA CUDA with at least 4GB of VRAM or AMD OpenCL with at least 4GB of VRAM RAM: 16GB minimum (32GB recommended) Storage: SSD or other high-speed drive with at least 256GB of free space You’ll also need to be running Linux Mint 18.3 or later, Ubuntu 16.04 or later, or CentOS/RHEL 7.3 or later.\nStep 2: Download DaVinci Resolve\nNext, head over to the Blackmagic Design website and download the DaVinci Resolve Linux installation package.\nStep 3: Install Required Dependencies\nBefore you can install DaVinci Resolve, you’ll need to install a few required dependencies. Open up a terminal window and type the following command:\nsudo apt-get install ocl-icd-opencl-dev fakeroot\nStep 4: Install DaVinci Resolve\nOnce you have the dependencies installed, navigate to the directory where you saved the DaVinci Resolve installation package and run the following command:\nsudo dpkg -i davinci-resolve_.deb\n(Note that you’ll need to replace with the version number of the installation package you downloaded.)\nStep 5: Configure DaVinci Resolve\nAfter you’ve installed DaVinci Resolve, you’ll need to configure it to work with your system.\nFirst, open up a terminal and run the following command:\nsudo nano /etc/security/limits.conf\nOnce the file opens, add the following lines to the end of the file:\nusername soft memlock 261144 username hard memlock 261144\n(Note that you’ll need to replace “username” with your actual username.)\nSave and close the file.\nNext, run the following command:\nsudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/98-davinci-resolve.conf\nAdd the following lines to the end of the file:\nvm.max_map_count=262144 kernel.sysrq=1\nSave and close the file.\nFinally, reboot your system to apply the changes.\nStep 6: Launch DaVinci Resolve\nOnce your system has rebooted, you should be able to launch DaVinci Resolve from the applications menu. When you first launch the application, you’ll be prompted to set up a project location and other basic settings.\nCongratulations! You’ve successfully installed and configured DaVinci Resolve on Linux. You’re now ready to start creating amazing videos and unleashing your inner Spielberg.\nIf you are a content creator, especially a video editor, then you have heard about DaVinci Resolve. DaVinci Resolve is known for its color correction capabilities in large film studios and comes with a powerful video and audio editor and composer, like Adobe After Effects, making it a go-to creative software among Linux creators. Unlike other creative software, DaVinci Resolve supports the Linux platform, so you don’t need any windows API translation layer like wine to install DaVinci Resolve.\nDownload Linux Binaries Go to the DaVinci Resolve release page and download the latest version. At the time of writing, the latest version is version 18. DaVinci Resolve comes in two versions: free and paid. Select and download the Linux binaries and save them in your download folder.\nInstall Required Drivers DaVinci Resolve is heavily dependent on GPU processing. If you have a recent Intel or AMD APU, then your integrated GPU may run DaVinci Resolve on your device. In most cases, you need an Nvidia GPU to run this software. Install the latest Nvidia drivers and CUDA for your Nvidia GPU in your Linux machine.\nInstall the Latest Nvidia Driver In Ubuntu For Ubuntu-based distributions, it is very easy to install GPU drivers. Run these commands for rebooting to install the Nvidia GPU for you.\nInstall the Latest Nvidia Driver in Debian For Debian-based distributions, you have to do something more than run some commands. Open the “/etc/apt/sources.list” file:\nAdd this line in the sources.list file. If it’s already present, append the contrib and non-free component.\nSave this file and exit. Run the following command in your terminal to install the Nvidia driver.\nTo install Cuda, you only need to run one command:\nAfter installation, reboot your device so that the changes can take effect.\nInstall the Latest Nvidia Driver in Fedora To install the Nvidia driver in Fedora Linux, you first need to enable the RPM fusion repository.\nDetect the Nvidia GPU and install the required drivers.\nAfter installation, reboot your machine and you are good to go.\nBuild a Deb Package The DaVinci Resolve Linux build was released to run on CentOS, a RedHat-owned distribution. Therefore, If you are using Fedora or another RedHat distribution, you don’t need to follow the build step.\nFor Fedora users, you have to unzip the downloaded file and double-click on the installer. It automatically installs and sets up all the files for you.\nFor Debian and Ubuntu-based distributions, you have to convert the DaVinci Resolve .run file into a .deb file.\nTo make this conversion possible, download and extract the MakeResolveDeb script.Create a folder and copy the DaVinci Resolve Installer and MakeResolveDeb script into the folder.Before the conversion, install some required dependencies to build and run DaVinci Resolve flawlessly.\nRun the following command to convert your .run file to a .deb file, assuming that you put both the script and .run installer into the same folder.\nIt is quite an intensive process, so give your machine some time to extract and build the .deb package for you. When completed, you will be greeted with a .deb file ready to be installed.\nInstalling Deb Package Installing a .deb file is really easy in Debian and Ubuntu derivatives. Run this command to install the package:\nIf this command runs without any errors, you can see the DaVinci Resolve icon in your app grid. Open the app and you will see a splash screen like the below image.\nDaVinci Resolve Free vs. Paid The DaVinci Resolve free version comes with all the basic features you need to edit your video, make motion graphics, color correct and edit your sounds.\nAlong with the free version, DaVinci Resolve studio version (paid) adds features such as a neural engine, stereoscopic 3D tools, dozens of extra Resolve FX filters, and Fairlight FX audio plugins, plus advanced HDR grading and HDR scopes.\nAll the studio features are required if you are working on a huge project, like filmmaking and documentaries. To make simple YouTube videos, the free version is enough for most users.\nIf you buy any Blackmagic gadgets, you get the studio version free of cost. If you are a professional video editor, consider buying the gadgets you may need.\nVideo Transcode to Use in Davinci Resolve In the free version of DaVinci Resolve, the H264 codec is not supported. Therefore, if you record video using this codec, you have to transcode the video to another format that DaVinci Resolve supports. To transcode our video, we are using FFmpeg.\nFFmpeg is a very powerful video transcoding and processing library and has many customization options. You can read the documentation to customize FFmpeg. To install it on your device, run the following command:\nTo edit your video inside DaVinci Resolve, you have to convert it to .mov format.\nIn the above command, it’s assumed your input file is “input.mp4” and the output file name is “output.mov.” You can change the names according to your preference.\nTo convert .mkv to .mp4, run the following command.\nSet Up OBS Studio for Davinci Resolve If you want to edit your screen recordings using DaVinci Resolve and don’t want to transcode your recorded file every time you want to edit, then you have to change some settings in your OBS application.\nInside your OBS settings, navigate to the “output” option and change the output mode to advanced.\nSwitch to the recording tab and change the output type to the custom output option (FFmpeg). Select “MOV” as the container format and “mpeg4” as a video encoder. In the audio encoder option, select the “pcm_s16le” option. You can refer to the settings below and make changes in your OBS software accordingly.\nSave the settings and restart the OBS software. You can test if the settings are working or not by recording a little clip and importing it into your DaVinci Resolve software.\nTranscode for Online Upload and Save Space You can see that when we transcode the files to edit in DaVinci Resolve, the sizes are very big – sometimes hundreds of gigabytes. Therefore, editing and uploading the rendered file of a few hundred gigabytes takes a very long time. Even if you want to store the files on your hard disk, those sizes are very huge compared to their length.\nTo fix this issue, we are using FFmpeg to transcode and compress our file. Run the following command in your terminal:\n“input.mov” is your .mov file from DaVinci Resolve, and “output.mp4” is your output .mp4 file. You can change these names to your preference.\nYou can change the compression and output quality by adjusting the -crf flag. By default, I set it to 1, the highest quality. You can set this flag up to 25 for maximum compression. It also reduces video quality when -crf is a very high number.\nFrequently Asked Questions Is DaVinci better than Premier? It is about personal choice. If you are familiar with Premier, and your editing workflow revolves around Adobe software, then it is better to use Premier than Resolve. If you are a newbie and want to learn DaVinci Resolve, then you are good to go. If you are an M1 Mac owner, then DaVinci Resolve runs better in Apple M1 Macs.\nIs 8GB RAM enough for DaVinci Resolve? You need at least 16 GB of RAM to run DaVinci Resolve smoothly on your device. In addition to RAM, you need a powerful graphic card with 4GB or more VRAM to make your workflow smooth. I recommend that you invest in a desktop rather than a laptop.\nDeveloper and writer.

If you are a professional video editor, consider buying the gadgets you may need.</p><h2 id=video-transcode-to-use-in-davinci-resolve>Video Transcode to Use in Davinci Resolve<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#video-transcode-to-use-in-davinci-resolve>#</a></h2><p>In the free version of DaVinci Resolve, the H264 codec is not supported. Therefore, if you record video using this codec, you have to transcode the video to another format that DaVinci Resolve supports. To transcode our video, we are using FFmpeg.</p><p>FFmpeg is a very powerful video transcoding and processing library and has many customization options. You can read the documentation to customize FFmpeg. To install it on your device, run the following command:</p><p>To edit your video inside DaVinci Resolve, you have to convert it to .mov format.</p><p>In the above command, it’s assumed your input file is “input.mp4” and the output file name is “output.mov.” You can change the names according to your preference.</p><p>To convert .mkv to .mp4, run the following command.</p><h2 id=set-up-obs-studio-for-davinci-resolve>Set Up OBS Studio for Davinci Resolve<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#set-up-obs-studio-for-davinci-resolve>#</a></h2><p>If you want to edit your screen recordings using DaVinci Resolve and don’t want to transcode your recorded file every time you want to edit, then you have to change some settings in your OBS application.</p><p>Inside your OBS settings, navigate to the “output” option and change the output mode to advanced.</p><p>Switch to the recording tab and change the output type to the custom output option (FFmpeg). Select “MOV” as the container format and “mpeg4” as a video encoder. In the audio encoder option, select the “pcm_s16le” option. You can refer to the settings below and make changes in your OBS software accordingly.</p><p>Save the settings and restart the OBS software. You can test if the settings are working or not by recording a little clip and importing it into your DaVinci Resolve software.</p><h2 id=transcode-for-online-upload-and-save-space>Transcode for Online Upload and Save Space<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#transcode-for-online-upload-and-save-space>#</a></h2><p>You can see that when we transcode the files to edit in DaVinci Resolve, the sizes are very big – sometimes hundreds of gigabytes. Therefore, editing and uploading the rendered file of a few hundred gigabytes takes a very long time. Even if you want to store the files on your hard disk, those sizes are very huge compared to their length.</p><p>To fix this issue, we are using FFmpeg to transcode and compress our file. Run the following command in your terminal:</p><p>“input.mov” is your .mov file from DaVinci Resolve, and “output.mp4” is your output .mp4 file. You can change these names to your preference.</p><p>You can change the compression and output quality by adjusting the -crf flag. By default, I set it to 1, the highest quality. You can set this flag up to 25 for maximum compression. It also reduces video quality when -crf is a very high number.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions>Frequently Asked Questions<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#frequently-asked-questions>#</a></h2><h3 id=is-davinci-better-than-premier>Is DaVinci better than Premier?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#is-davinci-better-than-premier>#</a></h3><p>It is about personal choice. If you are familiar with Premier, and your editing workflow revolves around Adobe software, then it is better to use Premier than Resolve. If you are a newbie and want to learn DaVinci Resolve, then you are good to go. If you are an M1 Mac owner, then DaVinci Resolve runs better in Apple M1 Macs.</p><h3 id=is-8gb-ram-enough-for-davinci-resolve>Is 8GB RAM enough for DaVinci Resolve?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#is-8gb-ram-enough-for-davinci-resolve>#</a></h3><p>You need at least 16 GB of RAM to run DaVinci Resolve smoothly on your device. In addition to RAM, you need a powerful graphic card with 4GB or more VRAM to make your workflow smooth. I recommend that you invest in a desktop rather than a laptop.</p><p>Developer and writer.
