Google Docs is one of the most popular online word processing tools used by millions of people worldwide. It is a versatile platform that allows you to collaborate in real-time with others, and for that reason, it’s often the go-to tool for professionals and students alike. However, there are some features that many users are unaware of or struggle with, such as moving images. Fortunately, we’re here with a quick and easy hack that will revolutionize your Google Docs game!\nThe Problem Many people find it frustrating when trying to move images around in Google Docs. It can be difficult to accurately position an image where you want it, and when you try to move it around, it often ends up in the wrong place. What’s more, when you do manage to position an image in the right place, it can be a challenge to keep it there as you continue to work on the document.\nThe Solution Thankfully, there’s an easy hack that will make moving images in Google Docs a breeze. All you need to do is:\nInsert your image into your Google Doc. Right-click on the image and select “Copy.” Paste the image into a text box using the “Insert” \u003e “Drawing” \u003e “New” option (or simply use the shortcut “Shift” + “Command” + “Y” on Mac or “Ctrl” + “Alt” + “Shift” + “Y” on Windows). After pasting the image, it will open up a new drawing. Now, you can switch back to your document and place the image anywhere you want, with the option to resize and move it around freely. The result? Your images will stay exactly where you want them, making it easier to maintain a professional-looking document.\nWhy It Works The reason why this hack works is that images pasted into a text box are anchored to the text. This means that they will move and resize with the text surrounding them. As you write and edit your document, your images will stay in place, regardless of how much text you insert or delete.\nConclusion So there you have it – a quick and easy hack to revolutionize your Google Docs game. With this simple trick, you’ll be able to move your images around with ease, ensuring that your work looks polished and professional. Go ahead and give it a try today – you’ll be glad you did!\nThis article explains how to move images in a Google Doc on the website and from the mobile app on Android, iOS, and iPadOS.\nWhat to Know\nClick+drag to move images in Docs. To change formatting, select the image, then In line, Wrap text, or Break text.In line puts the image on the line you choose. Wrap text lets you can drag it anywhere and adjust its margin.Break text prevents text from being on its left or right side. Move Images Using the Google Docs Website You can move a picture to a different part of the document at any time in Google Docs. For example, you may need to move a graphic closer to the text that describes it.\nA simple drag and drop is all you really need to do, but there are some settings you should know about to make the picture fit perfectly.\nHere’s what to do from the Google Docs website:\nClick and hold the image you want to move, and then drag it. Watch where the cursor is; that’s where the image will fall when you let go. If you need to move the picture to a different page, you can drag it near the top or bottom of the page, but that doesn’t always work well. A better way is to simultaneously scroll with your mouse (while still clicking-and-holding the photo). If the image and text don’t sit the way you want them to, select the image to find a menu just below it. Choose one of these options: In line: Puts the image on the line you choose, almost as if it were text in the sentence. Wrap text: Provides far more flexibility by literally wrapping text around the image. You can drag it anywhere you like. When you pick this option, you can also adjust the margin size around the picture. Break text: Prevents text from being on the left or right side. Adjust the margin to choose how much blank space there should be between the image and text. Resizing and Other Options There are some other things you can do with the image, such as resize and rotate it. If you’re dealing with several pictures and need to make them all fit right, or if you have some that are too small or large for the document.\nClick and hold the image you want to move, and then drag it.

Adjust the margin to choose how much blank space there should be between the image and text.\nTo resize a picture, select it and drag a corner box toward the direction you want: away from the photo to make it bigger or toward it to downsize. You can drag the circle button at the top left or right to rotate the image.\nMove Images While Using the Google Docs App Open the document and choose the edit/pencil button to go into editing mode, and then follow these steps:\nFor fine control over the image’s width, height, and angle rotation, right-click the photo and choose Image options.\nTap the image once to show the boxed corners. This is how you know you’re ready to move it. Tap and hold the image, drag wherever you want it to go, and then let go. On Android, iOS, and iPadOS, you can track where the image will end up if you follow the cursor that’s visible right above your finger. The latter two operating systems also show the picture as you’re moving it: Moving an Image on iPad. You can pick a different layout option for the image if it doesn’t seem to interact well with the text. To do that, tap it and then select the text wrap icon at the top or bottom of the screen (it’s a small image with text around it). Android users can also select the image, use its pop-up menu to go into the three-dot extended menu, and then choose Image options \u003e Text wrap. These are your options (they differ between platforms): In line: Have the image sit on the same line as the text.Wrap text: Force all the text to wrap around the image.Break text: The image will sit between the text above and below it so that no text will be to the left or right.In front of text: The page text will go behind the image. Tap the checkmark from the menu to save any changes. Additional Mobile Settings Other settings are available below the text wrap settings, such as adjusting the margins around the picture.\nTap the image once to show the boxed corners.
