By asking these 10 things, you can unlock even more productivity with the app. Give it a try and see how it can enhance your messaging experience.\nGoogle Allo is a smart messaging app by Google, and thousands of users have downloaded the app since it became available to the public. It’s not your everyday messaging app where you tap on your friend’s contact info and send them a message. There’s actually a reason why the app is called a smart app.\nThe app comes with Google’s own virtual assistant – something like Siri on Apple devices – that helps you in most of your everyday tasks. From helping you to set a reminder on your phone to helping you know how tall the Eiffel tower is, the app has answers to all of your queries. As soon as you start using the virtual assistant on your phone, you’ll get to know all it can do for you.\nFor you folks here we have collected some of the things you can ask Google Allo on your smartphone. This is to just give you an idea as to what the app is capable of doing, and then you can make it do more using your imagination.\nSome of the Things You Can Ask Google Allo To do the following things you are going to need the Google Allo app installed on your smartphone. The app is available for both Android and iOS.\nOnce you have downloaded the app, launch the app and tap on the contact that says Google Assistant, and you should be all set to fire the following commands.\nFinding Nearby Places Such as ATMs and Restaurants If you’re new to a place and want to find the nearby ATMs, restaurants, and such, then you can enter in your query as the following, and the assistant should help you find those places.\nNearby ATMs – lists all the available ATMs in your area.\nNearby Restaurants – lists all the nearby restaurants.\nBasically, what you need to do is just use the word “nearby” before the place you’re looking for, and you’ll get results.\nGetting Answers to General Questions If you’re a curious person and always like to read about science and facts, then Google Allo is your best friend. The app can help you discover some interesting facts with its huge database. All you need to get to those facts is to use the following query with Google Assistant.\nTell me a fact – it will tell you a random fact\nHow tall is Eiffel tower? – Similarly, you can use any other popular place’s name and get information about it.\nWho was the first president of the United States?\nAs you can see in the above examples, you can just ask a question in the app, and it’ll give you an answer just like how you used to ask questions to your teachers in your school days. Google Allo is no less than your teacher, is it?\nOne thing you should note here is that you can also ask it contextual questions. For example, if you asked “how tall is Eiffel tower,” you can then ask another question about that object such as “When was it built?”\nGetting the Weather Details If you’re looking to go out and want to see how the weather is going to be that day, you can ask the assistant, and it will give you all the information about the that day’s weather.\nWeather today – it will give you that day’s weather details\nWeather for the week – it will give you the weather details for the current week\nWeather for the weekend – it will give you the weekend’s weather details\nGetting Translations for a Foreign Language People who travel to various countries often face the issue of not being able to understand a foreign language when they try to communicate with the people in a foreign land. As long as you have Google Assistant, you shouldn’t have any issues as the app can do translations for you as well.\nFor instance, if you’re in Paris and you’d like to ask someone where the Eiffel tower is in French, then you can ask the following query to Google Assistant, and it will provide you with the French translation:\nTranslate “Where is Eiffel tower” to French\nYou’ll immediately get the translation on your screen. Not only French, but it supports a number of other languages, so you shouldn’t have any issues the next time you pack your bags for a land far away.\nSetting Up Reminders If you’d like to be reminded about something, you can ask the assistant to set a reminder for you, and it will remind you when the specific time comes up.\nFor example, if you’d like to be reminded about buying groceries at 5 PM today, you can ask the following query to the assistant and it will get the reminder set up for you:\nSet a Reminder for Buying Groceries at 5 PM today\nThe reminder should all be set up. In case you want to cancel it, just tap the Cancel button below the reminder.\nGetting Entertained When You Are Bored We get bored many times and would like to have someone to entertain us. Google Assistant does come with entertainment, and you can use the following queries to launch it:\nTell me a joke\nShow me a funny video\nRecite a poem\nPlay a game\nI’m bored – it will show you all the available ways it can entertain you\nIt does the task of entertaining you very well, as it has vast things to present to you when you’re bored.\nConclusion If you have just installed Google Allo on your smartphone and you’re wondering what it can do for you, the commands above should give you an idea. From helping you improve your general knowledge to entertaining you with a joke, it has everything you would expect from a virtual assistant.\nMahesh Makvana is a freelance tech writer who’s written thousands of posts about various tech topics on various sites.
