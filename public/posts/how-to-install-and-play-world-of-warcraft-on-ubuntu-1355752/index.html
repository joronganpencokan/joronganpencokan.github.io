Many people enjoy playing WoW on their Windows or Mac computers, but what about Ubuntu users? Is it possible to play WoW on Ubuntu? The answer is yes, and in this article, we will explore the ultimate guide to playing World of Warcraft on Ubuntu.\nStep 1: Install Wine\nWine is a compatibility layer that allows Ubuntu users to run Windows applications, including games. To install Wine, open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install wine\nThis will download and install Wine on your Ubuntu system.\nStep 2: Download the WoW client\nTo play WoW on Ubuntu, you need to have a copy of the game client. You can download the client from the official WoW website or from Blizzard’s Battle.net app.\nStep 3: Install the WoW client using Wine\nOnce you have downloaded the WoW client, you need to install it using Wine. To do this, right-click on the downloaded file and select Open With \u003e Other Application. In the dialog box, choose Wine and click on the Open button.\nThis will start the installation process, and you need to follow the instructions provided by the installer. Make sure to select the correct language and region settings during the installation.\nStep 4: Configure Wine for WoW\nAfter installing the WoW client, you need to configure Wine for optimal performance. The first step is to install the necessary Windows DLL files. You can do this by running the following commands in the terminal:\nwinetricks corefonts vcrun2017\nThis will download and install the required DLL files.\nNext, you need to configure Wine to use OpenGL instead of DirectX. To do this, open the Wine configuration tool by running the command:\nwinecfg\nIn the Graphics tab, select the “Emulate a virtual desktop” option and choose a resolution that matches your screen size. Then, select the “Automatically capture the mouse in the full-screen window” option.\nIn the Libraries tab, add the “d3d9” library and set it to “disabled”.\nStep 5: Launch WoW on Ubuntu\nNow, you are ready to launch WoW on your Ubuntu system. To do this, navigate to the directory where you installed the WoW client and run the following command in the terminal:\nwine Wow.exe\nThis will launch WoW, and you can start playing the game on your Ubuntu system.\nConclusion\nPlaying World of Warcraft on Ubuntu is possible, thanks to Wine. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can unleash the power of WoW on your Ubuntu system and enjoy the game alongside Windows and Mac users. So go ahead and discover the ultimate guide to playing World of Warcraft on Ubuntu!\nAs World of Warcraft’s seventh expansion draws nearer, interest in the venerable MMO is peaking again. For a long time WoW has been a game known to work well through the Wine compatibility layer on Linux, even though it’s never been officially supported. There was even a time when rumors were flying that Blizzard’s developers tested WoW for Wine compatibility.\nSince World of Warcraft dropped OpenGL support and moved to DirectX 11, things haven’t been so simple. There’s been plenty of breakage and odd graphical glitches, and that doesn’t take into account the problematic Battle.net app or the decreased framerates. But it can still be just as easy as before.\nLutris and its scripted installs make playing World of Warcraft on Ubuntu about as easy as it is on Windows, and the performance is great, even on lower-powered systems.\nMake Sure Your Drivers Are Installed Before you go any further, make sure that you have the latest drivers installed for your graphics card. Check out the Steam guide. It does a great job covering driver installation pretty. Once you have your drivers installed, reboot your computer to make sure that you’re using them.\nInstall Lutris Lutris isn’t in the default Ubuntu repositories, but the Lutris developers do maintain a convenient repository. Before you get that set up, though, you’ll need to create a Lutris account, if you don’t already have one.\nCreate Your Lutris Account Head over to the Lutris registration page and create your account. Lutris only uses the account to keep track of your downloads and your library. They don’t sell you anything or try to track you. You only need to give it a username, email, and password.\nAdd the Lutris Repository These repository instructions are straight form Lutris. They first look for which version of Ubuntu you’re running, then create a file in your Apt sources directory that points to the repository for your version of Ubuntu. Finally, they import the GPG signing key for the repository.\nAfter you’ve run all three commands, you’re ready to update Apt and install Lutris. From now on, you’ll receive regular updates for Lutris on your system.\nInstall Lutris Update Apt and install Lutris like you normally would.\nRun the WoW Installer Lutris has a page on its website for each game that it supports. WoW is no exception. Go to the Lutris WoW page, and click on the “Install” button below the main image. Your browser will ask you if you want to open the script with Lutris. Click “Agree.”\nA new window will pop open. It’ll start off by asking if you do, in fact, want to begin installing WoW. Click to confirm. The Lutris install script will kick off and start setting up your Wine prefix for WoW. In the process, it’ll download a few Windows components and fonts to make everything go smoothly.\nNext, the installer will start the regular Battle.net installer. Follow the steps for Battle.net. When it’s done, don’t sign in. Instead, close the Battle.net window to allow the installer to finish. After a couple of seconds, Lutris will show you a success message. Close the message window. There’s something else you need to do.\nCheck For Wine Updates Wine updates frequently, and those updates usually bring performance improvements with them. Before you start the game, it’s best to make sure that you’re using the latest version of Wine.\nClick on the “Runners” icon at the top of the main Lutris window. It’s the second icon from the left, and it looks like gears by default.\nA new window will pop open, displaying a list of available runners. The list is alphabetical, so Wine is towards the bottom. Scroll down and click on Wine. A new window will pop open listing the available Wine versions. There are a lot. Look for the latest version with the PBA patches. It’ll have “pba” in the name. Click on the checkbox next to the name to start downloading it. If it’s already checked, you have the latest one. Close both runner windows, and return to the main Lutris screen.\nRight-click on the WoW banner image, and select “Configure” on the menu that pops open. Another window will open up with all the available options for your WoW install. Click on “Runner options,” and look for the Wine option. Select the Wine version, and choose the latest version of Wine-PBA.\nReturn to the main Lutris window.\nPlay World of Warcraft Click on the WoW banner image to launch the game. Actually, it’s not the game. The Lutris installer can only go so far, and it can’t script the Battle.net client. You’re going to need to sign in to your Battle.net account and click the “Install” button for WoW yourself. There’s nothing special that you need, though. This is just the standard procedure, like on Windows.\nThe game will take some time to download. World of Warcraft weighs in at around 50GB. After you have it, launch the game with “Play.”\nIt’s always a safe bet to turn your settings down at first to make sure that everything is working properly. Then, slowly dial it up to see what your computer can handle. Try exploring a capital city in the game to test it.\nThe latest patch for the expansion just launched. Don’t expect perfection. In testing this, there was a weird bug where textures didn’t load. It seems like a texture caching thing because it did stop, but just be prepared. That also means that you shouldn’t have any new problems when Battle for Azeroth does launch.\nThat said, there’s no reason you can’t enjoy the game to its fullest. And, of course, FOR THE HORDE!\nNick is a freelance tech. journalist, Linux enthusiast, and a long time PC gamer.\nOur latest tutorials delivered straight to your inbox\n","wordCount":"1432","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rose Hambleton"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-install-and-play-world-of-warcraft-on-ubuntu-1355752/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unleash The Power: Discover The Ultimate Guide To Playing World Of Warcraft On Ubuntu!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 1, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1432 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Rose Hambleton</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#make-sure-your-drivers-are-installed>Make Sure Your Drivers Are Installed</a></li><li><a href=#install-lutris>Install Lutris</a><ul><li><a href=#create-your-lutris-account>Create Your Lutris Account</a></li><li><a href=#add-the-lutris-repository>Add the Lutris Repository</a></li><li><a href=#install-lutris-1>Install Lutris</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#run-the-wow-installer>Run the WoW Installer</a></li><li><a href=#check-for-wine-updates>Check For Wine Updates</a></li><li><a href=#play-world-of-warcraft>Play World of Warcraft</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Introduction</p><p>World of Warcraft, also known as WoW, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that has been popular among gamers since its release in 2004.
