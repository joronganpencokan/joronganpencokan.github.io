However, did you know that there are hidden features in Windows 11 waiting to be discovered? These features are not readily accessible through the traditional means. Thankfully, with this sneaky control panel trick, you can unlock these hidden gems.\nTo access the control panel, right-click on the Windows icon in the taskbar, then select “Settings” from the menu. Once the Settings app opens, scroll to the bottom and click on “Advanced settings.” You will then be directed to the advanced settings page, where you will find a group of five links.\nNow, hold down the “CTRL + SHIFT + LEFT ALT + D” keys simultaneously for five seconds. Once you successfully do this, a new button labeled “Advanced Options” will appear on the screen.\nClick on the “Advanced Options” button, and a new window will open, revealing the hidden features of Windows 11. These features include Application Guard, Bank Mode, Device Encryption, Hyper-V, and WiFi Direct. Each of these features is designed to enhance the security and functionality of your system.\nApplication Guard is perhaps the most noteworthy feature for security-conscious users. This feature allows you to isolate and run untrusted websites and applications in an isolated environment, making it difficult for malicious software to infect your PC.\nBank Mode is another feature that adds an extra layer of security when performing financial transactions online. Bank Mode creates a sandboxed browsing environment that ensures your banking information remains secure from prying eyes and malicious software threats.\nDevice Encryption is a feature that automatically encrypts all data on your PC, making it harder for hackers to gain access to your sensitive data. Hyper-V allows you to run virtual machines (VMs) on your PC, making it easier to test software or run multiple operating systems simultaneously.\nWiFi Direct is a feature that enables devices to communicate with each other directly, without the need for a centralized access point. This feature can be particularly useful when transferring files between devices that don’t have WiFi access.\nIn conclusion, Windows 11 has hidden features that can only be accessed through the control panel using the sneaky trick highlighted in this article. By unlocking these features, you can customize the functionality of your system and improve its security. It’s essential to note that some of these features may not be compatible with your hardware or may require specific system requirements.
