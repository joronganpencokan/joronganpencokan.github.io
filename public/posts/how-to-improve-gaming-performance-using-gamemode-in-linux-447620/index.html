If you are a Linux gamer, you might have faced the problem of low FPS while playing your favorite games. This issue can be frustrating as it can ruin your gaming experience.\nGamemode is a solution to this problem. It is a tool that optimizes your Linux system for gaming and boosts the FPS in games. In this article, we will discuss why Gamemode is important and how to use it.\nThe Importance of Gamemode Gamemode is a system daemon that sets the CPU governor and I/O scheduler to performance mode when a game is launched. This means that your system will prioritize the game and give it more resources to improve performance.\nThe default governor and I/O scheduler settings are usually set to power-saving mode, which is good for regular use but not ideal for gaming. Gamemode makes sure that your system is optimized for gaming and that you get the best possible performance while playing games.\nGamemode is compatible with most Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Arch, Manjaro, Fedora, and more.\nHow to Install Gamemode Gamemode is available in most Linux repositories, which means that you can simply install it using your distribution’s package manager.\nFor Ubuntu-based distributions: sudo apt install gamemode For Arch-based distributions: pacman -S gamemode For Fedora-based distributions: sudo dnf install gamemode Once you have installed Gamemode, you can proceed to the next step.\nHow to Use Gamemode Using Gamemode is as simple as running a command in the terminal.\nTo enable Gamemode for a game, simply prefix the game’s command with “gamemoderun.” For example, if you want to launch “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,” you would use the following command:\ngamemoderun ./csgo_linux64 This will launch the game with Gamemode enabled. You can also create a shell script that enables Gamemode for all your games automatically.\n#!/bin/bash gamemoderun \"$1\" Save this script as “gamerun” and make it executable using the following command:\nchmod +x gamerun Now, whenever you want to launch a game, simply use the following command:\n./gamerun Conclusion Gamemode is a powerful tool that can help you unlock the ultimate gaming experience in Linux. It is easy to install and use and can significantly boost your FPS in games. If you are a Linux gamer, we highly recommend that you give Gamemode a try.\nWe hope that you found this article helpful. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to leave a comment below.\nHappy gaming!\nLinux is a great platform for gaming, but it can sometimes be challenging to get the best performance out of your games. This is where GameMode, a tool that allows you to optimize your system for gaming, comes in. Here we show you how to install and use GameMode to improve gaming performance in Linux.\nAlso check out some of the best games for Linux.\nWhat Is GameMode? GameMode is a command line utility that improves gaming performance on Linux. It is developed and maintained by Feral Interactive.\nGameMode works by optimizing your system for gaming. It sets your CPU governor to “performance” mode and your system’s I/O priority to real time. This ensures that your games have the best chance of running smoothly without hiccups.\nAdditionally, GameMode can disable or reduce the effects of CPU frequency scaling and process scheduler latency adjustments. This further improves game performance, especially in multiplayer games where every second matters.\nOn the other hand, if you are having high CPU usage issue in Linux, we have the fixes here.\nHow to Install GameMode on Your Linux System Update and upgrade all your packages:\nBefore we install the GameMode package, we need to install a couple of dependencies that GameMode will use. GameMode depends on systemd for internal communication and meson for building. Install the dependencies with this command:\nYou may be asked whether you want to continue with the installation. If so, press Y to proceed.\nClone the latest version of GameMode from Github. This downloads the package to the folder from which you are running the terminal.\nChange your directory to gamemode:\nBuild GameMode using these commands:\nTest whether GameMode was installed correctly using this command:\nThe command will test the GameMode installation with a series of commands. If everything worked correctly, you will receive a success message stating that all tests passed. Using GameMode to Improve Gaming Performance on Standalone Games By default, GameMode does not detect your games. Therefore, you have to start it every time you want to play a game.\nAlthough the game in this example, Kmines, does not use heavy graphics, we are starting it using GameMode to illustrate how to run games.\nTo start your game using GameMode, follow these steps:\nLaunch your game from the terminal starting with the gamemoderun command. For KMines, the command is: Your game should start with enhanced performance from GameMode.\nTo test whether GameMode is working correctly, run this command: If your game uses GameMode, you should get a message saying “gamemode is active” on your terminal. If you close the game, GameMode will be deactivated automatically.\nAlternative: if your computer only has a limited amount of RAM, use zswap to improve its performance.\nUsing GameMode on Steam You can also run your Steam games using GameMode to improve gaming performance. Assuming that you have Steam set up and your game downloaded, follow these steps to play games on Steam using GameMode:\nUnder your library tab, right-click on the game you wish to launch and click “Properties.”\nType in this command in the launch options textbox:\nExit the properties window.\nLaunch the game by tapping on the “Play” option. To confirm that your game launched correctly, open a new terminal window and type this command to check whether GameMode is active:\nIf all went well, you should get a message saying, “gamemode is active.”\nTip: learn how to track your Steam stats, deals, spending and play time.\nUsing GameMode on Lutris If you are an avid Linux gamer, you may be familiar with Lutris Lutris, an open-source gaming platform for Linux, that makes it easy to install and manage games from various sources, including Steam, GOG, and even your collection of Windows games.\nSimilar to Steam, setting GameMode on Lutris involves adding a command prefix to the game launch configurations. To improve gaming performance using GameMode on Lutris:\nOn your Lutris home screen, right-click on the game you want to launch and click “Configure.”\nClick on the “Systems options” tab to set the configurations for the game.\nScroll to the “Command Prefix” option and type in the following command in the textbox:\nClick on “Save” to exit the configuration menu.\nRight-click on the game you want to run and click “Play.” The game will launch using GameMode. The best part about using GameMode on Lutris is that you only have to configure the game once. The game will automatically run when you launch it the next time with GameMode on. You can also run the gamemoded -s command to check whether GameMode is active.\nUsing GameMode on Non-Games While GameMode was designed to be used with games on Linux, you can also use it on non-games to improve performance. This feature is handy when running heavy apps, such as video- and photo-editing tools.\nUsing GameMode with non-games is pretty straightforward. Launch the app from the terminal using the gamemoderun prefix. For example, the following command will launch GIMP with enhanced performance from GameMode:\nFrequently Asked Questions All screenshots by Allan Ngetich.\nHow do I turn GameMode off? GameMode automatically turns off once you close the game or the app you used. Regardless of the platform you are using, close the game, and GameMode will turn off automatically.\nDoes Game Mode increase FPS? Yes, GameMode can increase FPS for some games. Games that are particularly CPU-heavy may see the most benefit with GameMode. If you do not see a significant increase in FPS after enabling GameMode, your game may be more limited by your GPU than your CPU.\nDoes GameMode use more battery? Yes, GameMode will use more battery power when active, as it is designed to do. However, the effect on battery life will vary depending on the game. Games that are more demanding on system resources will significantly decrease battery life when GameMode is enabled. For less demanding games, the impact on battery life may be negligible.\nFor prolonged battery life, follow these tips to improve battery life on a Linux laptop.\nAllan Ngetich is a writer at Make Tech Easier, a website that provides tips, tricks and tutorials on technology.
