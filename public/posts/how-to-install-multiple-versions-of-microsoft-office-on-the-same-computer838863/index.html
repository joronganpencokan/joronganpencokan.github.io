Whether it’s Word for document creation, Excel for spreadsheets, or PowerPoint for presentations; the applications that make up the suite are essential tools in any office setting.\nBut what happens when you need to use multiple versions of Office on the same computer? Maybe you have an old version of Office that you need for compatibility reasons, or perhaps you want to test a new version before committing to an upgrade. Whatever the reason, having multiple Office versions on the same machine can be a headache. Luckily, there’s a way to make it work flawlessly with the help of a single tool.\nMeet “Hugo,” the program that makes it easy to have multiple versions of Microsoft Office on one computer. This lightweight and straightforward software can help you create “virtual machines” that allow you to install and use different versions of Office on the same operating system.\nHow does it work? The concept is simple. Hugo creates a “container,” a virtual environment where you can install and use different versions of Office, without interfering with your primary operating system. You can create different containers for different versions of Office, and switch between them with ease without running into any conflicts or compatibility issues.\nHere’s how you can do it:\nStep 1: Download and install Hugo from the official website.\nStep 2: Launch the program and click on “Create Container” to start creating your virtual environment.\nStep 3: Name your container and select the version of Office you want to install. Hugo supports all versions of Microsoft Office, including Office 365, Office 2019, and older versions like Office 2003.\nStep 4: Choose the location where you want to keep your container files. Hugo will create a new folder where it will store all the files related to the specific Office version you selected.\nStep 5: Wait for the container to be created. This process may take some time, depending on the Office version you selected.\nStep 6: Once the container is created, launch it, and install the selected Office version as you would usually do. You can now use this version of Office within the container without any interference from other versions of Office installed on your computer.\nYou can create multiple containers for different Office versions and switch between them with ease. You can also delete a container if you no longer need it, which will delete all files associated with it, freeing up disk space.\nHugo also allows you to customize your container settings. For example, you can allocate more or less RAM, increase or decrease the container’s virtual graphics memory, and even set up networking options. This flexibility allows you to tailor each container to your specific needs.\nIn conclusion, having multiple versions of Microsoft Office on one computer is no longer a hassle thanks to Hugo. With its simple and intuitive user interface, you can create virtual environments and use different versions of Office without running into any conflicts or compatibility issues. Give it a try, and see for yourself how easy it is to manage multiple versions of Office on one computer!\nBecause of the myriad of problems that crop up when trying to run multiple versions of Microsoft Office (think: file associations, Equation Editor, shortcut bars, among other problems), it’s best to stick to having one version of Office on your computer. In fact, using the latest version will likely save you from the most headaches.\nSomething to keep in mind, too: Older versions of Office might not be able to open files created with newer versions of Office.\nIf you insist on running more than one version of Office, here are some steps you can take to minimize problems you’ll run into.\nDouble Check That All Office Versions Are the Same Bit Count You cannot install both 32-bit and 64-bit downloads of Microsoft Office, whatever the suite versions (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016, or Microsoft 365). Keep in mind that the 32-bit version of Office can run on either the 32-bit or 64-bit versions of Windows. Also, Microsoft Office may install as 32-bit by default, unless you already have a 64-bit version of Office on your computer, so Microsoft is a great resource for how to opt for the 64-bit version instead, or how to decide which is best for you in general.\nInstall Early Versions of Office Before Later Ones If you are trying to install Microsoft Office 2007 and Microsoft Office 2010 on the same machine, you should begin with Office 2007, for example.\nThe reason for this is that each installation involves a bunch of moving parts. Each has a specific way its shared programs, registry keys, file extensions, and other specifics are handled.\nThe same holds for Office programs that are purchased separately or that require unique installation. For example, you might purchase Microsoft Project or Microsoft Visio separately. Earlier versions should still be installed before later versions, across the board.\nTip: You Cannot Do This With Microsoft Outlook If you try to install a second version of Outlook, the Setup program will only do so in lieu of other versions you may already have installed.\nYou will be prompted to either select Keep These Programs or Remove Previous Versions. Other programs in the Microsoft Office suite may give you problems as well. Some users report issues when installing multiple versions of Microsoft Access, for example.\nIf you do run into a situation where some programs install correctly and others don’t, consider uninstalling one of the multiple versions of that program if possible. Depending on how your suite is packaged, you may or may not be able to do this on your own. In those cases, you can either go back to using just one version of Office or reach out to Microsoft for additional perspective.\nTip: Inserted OLE Objects Will Likely Default to the Earliest Version In Microsoft Office, OLE Objects (Object Linking and Embedding) are document elements from programs other than the one you are working in. For example, you may insert an Excel spreadsheet in a Word document.\nIf you Insert - OLE Objects into a document, those objects will be formatted according to the most recent version of Office installed on your computer, regardless of which version you are working in.\nThis means problems may ensue if you are sharing files with others who have different versions of Office than yours, for example.\nContact Microsoft Support If Necessary Again, if you decide you want to go into a multi-version install, expect hiccups. Make sure you backup your files, but also be prepared with backup keys or installation codes. If you have any questions about these or to get additional help, please check out Microsoft’s Support site.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1163","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-19T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-19T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Joshua Jones"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-install-multiple-versions-of-microsoft-office-on-the-same-computer838863/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't believe how easy it is to have multiple Microsoft Office versions on one computer!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-19 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 19, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1163 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Joshua Jones</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#double-check-that-all-office-versions-are-the-same-bit-count>Double Check That All Office Versions Are the Same Bit Count</a></li><li><a href=#install-early-versions-of-office-before-later-ones>Install Early Versions of Office Before Later Ones</a></li><li><a href=#tip-you-cannot-do-this-with-microsoft-outlook>Tip: You Cannot Do This With Microsoft Outlook</a></li><li><a href=#tip-inserted-ole-objects-will-likely-default-to-the-earliest-version>Tip: Inserted OLE Objects Will Likely Default to the Earliest Version</a></li><li><a href=#contact-microsoft-support-if-necessary>Contact Microsoft Support If Necessary</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Title: You Won&rsquo;t Believe How Easy It Is to Have Multiple Microsoft Office Versions on One Computer!</p><p>Article:</p><p>Microsoft Office is one of the most popular productivity software suites in the world, and with good reason.
