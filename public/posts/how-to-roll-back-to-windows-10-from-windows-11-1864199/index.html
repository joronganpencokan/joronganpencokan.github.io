Learn The Secret To Rolling Back To The Beloved Windows 10 Now! If you’ve recently upgraded your computer to Windows 11, you may have noticed that it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Perhaps you’ve encountered some compatibility issues with your software, or maybe you just don’t like the new look and feel of the operating system. Whatever the reason may be, you can always roll back to the beloved Windows 10, and we’re here to share the secret with you.\nStep-by-Step Guide: Rolling Back to Windows 10 Step 1: Backup Your Data Rolling back your operating system will inevitably cause some data loss, so it’s crucial to backup all of your important documents, photos, videos, and any other important files. You can simply copy them to an external hard drive, USB flash drive, or upload them to cloud storage.\nStep 2: Check Your System Requirements Before you start the rollback process, it’s essential to make sure that your computer meets the system requirements for Windows 10. The minimum requirements are:\nProcessor: 1 GHz or faster compatible processor Memory/RAM: 1 GB for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit Storage: 16 GB for 32-bit or 20 GB for 64-bit Graphics card: DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver Display: 800x600 Step 3: Create a Windows 10 Installation Media To roll back to Windows 10, you’ll need to create a Windows 10 installation media. You can download the latest version of Windows 10 from Microsoft’s website and create a bootable USB flash drive or DVD.\nStep 4: Boot from the Windows 10 Installation Media Insert the Windows 10 installation media into your computer and restart it. To boot from the installation media, you may need to change the boot order in the BIOS settings to prioritize the USB flash drive or DVD.\nStep 5: Choose the Custom Installation Option When you’re asked to choose an installation type, select the Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) option.\nStep 6: Delete Your Current Windows 11 Operating System In the next screen, you’ll see a list of partitions. You need to delete the partition that contains your current Windows 11 operating system. Click on Drive options (advanced) and then click on Delete.\nStep 7: Install Windows 10 on the Deleted Partition After deleting the partition, click on the unallocated space and then click on New. This will create a new partition where you can install Windows 10. Select the new partition and click on Next to proceed with the installation.\nStep 8: Activate Windows 10 After the installation is complete, you’ll need to activate Windows 10. You can use your existing Windows 10 product key, or you can purchase a new one from Microsoft.\nConclusion Rolling back to Windows 10 may seem daunting at first, but it’s a straightforward process as long as you follow the steps carefully. Remember to backup your important data, check your system requirements, and create a Windows 10 installation media beforehand. With these steps, you’ll be able to enjoy your old, beloved operating system in no time!\nIn Summary\nMicrosoft has officially released the latest version of its desktop operating system – the Windows 11 to the public. Windows 11 brings few subtle improvements with it, like enhanced animations, revamped UI, a centered taskbar, and more, but it might not suit everyone’s preferences. Today, we have listed all possible ways to downgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 11 easily.\nWhile the software brings few subtle improvements with it, like enhanced animations, revamped UI, a centered taskbar, and more, it might not suit everyone’s preferences.\nSince Windows 10 has been around for a few years now, many users are accustomed to it and might not like the new UI changes in Windows 11. Further, as this is a new major update, it is bound to have some bugs owing to which one might want to roll back to Windows 10. Today, we have listed all possible ways to downgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 11 easily. So what are we waiting for? Let’s dive in.\nUsing the Roll-Back Option Microsoft has made it extremely easy to roll back to Windows 10 in the first ten days of installing Windows 11. Let us have a look:\nClick on the Windows icon and open Settings. Now choose Windows updates from the drop-down menu.\nHere, look for the advanced option and click on it Scroll down a bit and select the Recovery option\nUnder Recovery, choose the Go back option, and follow the on-screen instructions. Boom, you have successfully rolled back to the previous version of windows.\nUsing Microsoft Media Creation Tool If you want to roll back after the ten days are over, then alternatively, you can use the Microsoft Media Creation tool. The tool helps you install Windows 10 easily but do note you will lose your data.\nDownload MediaCreation Tool Run the setup file and click on Accept.\nNow you are greeted with two options. Select Upgrade this PC option and hit next.\nThe tool will now start downloading the latest version of Windows 10 Once downloaded, hit next and accept the terms. Here, you will see the “Choose what to keep” screen. Make sure to choose the Nothing option here and click next. Finally, choose the install option, and your PC will start installing Windows 10.\nClean Installing Windows 10 using an ISO file If you want to perform a clean installation, then ISO is the way to go. However, the process is a bit more lengthy and tricky compared to the method we mentioned earlier. So let us have a look.\nPrerequisites Download Windows 10 ISO A USB drive (minimum 8GB) Download Rufus\nMake sure to take a backup of your personal files as they will get deleted during the installation process.\nSteps to create a bootable USB drive Open rufus, which we downloaded earlier. After opening rufus, connect your USB drive to your PC. Please note- All the data on the USB drive will get wiped. Now choose your USB in rufus. Once that is done, just below devices, there is an option to choose an ISO file. Click on Select ISO and choose the Windows 10 ISO.\nUnder the partition scheme, there will be two options – GPT and MBR. Now, this will depend upon your Disk. In our case, it is MBR, so we chose MBR. Hit start and wait patiently as this may take some time.\nSteps to check partition (MBR or GPT) As we saw in the steps above, it is essential to choose the correct partition scheme. If we choose the wrong partition scheme, then you will be unable to install Windows 11 on a PC. So let us have a detailed look at the steps on how you can check your partition scheme.\nGo to the start menu and search “Create and format disk partitions,” and open it. After opening, you will see all your drives. Here, click on the drive you will install Windows 11 on and right-click and select Properties. In the properties tab, click on Hardware and choose Properties again Look for the Volumes tab and select it.\nHit Populate, and you will find the partition scheme under the partition style. Now, you can go back and continue making a bootable USB drive.\nSetting up Windows 10 on PC after a clean installation Open BIOS settings on your laptop. That being said, the process to enter bios is different for different manufactures. After you have successfully entered bios settings, search for the boot preferences. Again, this differs from device to device. In the boot, preferences select USB drive as first boot priority and restart your device. Click start and start following the on-screen instructions. Once setup is complete, the PC will restart. At this point, remove your USB drive from the PC. Boom, you will now be greeted with the new Windows 10 startup screen. (The device might reboot a few times during this process) Once the device boots successfully, follow the new Windows 10 setup screen. Congratulations, you have now successfully rolled back to Windows 10 on your PC.\nAs you saw, downgrading to the previous version of Windows was a relatively simple and easy process. Do let us know your thoughts about Windows 11 in the comment section below.\n","wordCount":"1386","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Else Hand"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-roll-back-to-windows-10-from-windows-11-1864199/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Windows 11 Got You Down?

In the properties tab, click on Hardware and choose Properties again
Look for the Volumes tab and select it.</p><p>Hit Populate, and you will find the partition scheme under the partition style. Now, you can go back and continue making a bootable USB drive.</p><h3 id=setting-up-windows-10-on-pc-after-a-clean-installation>Setting up Windows 10 on PC after a clean installation<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#setting-up-windows-10-on-pc-after-a-clean-installation>#</a></h3><p>Open BIOS settings on your laptop. That being said, the process to enter bios is different for different manufactures.
After you have successfully entered bios settings, search for the boot preferences. Again, this differs from device to device.
In the boot, preferences select USB drive as first boot priority and restart your device.
Click start and start following the on-screen instructions.
Once setup is complete, the PC will restart. At this point, remove your USB drive from the PC. Boom, you will now be greeted with the new Windows 10 startup screen. (The device might reboot a few times during this process)
Once the device boots successfully, follow the new Windows 10 setup screen. Congratulations, you have now successfully rolled back to Windows 10 on your PC.</p><p>As you saw, downgrading to the previous version of Windows was a relatively simple and easy process.
