Or have you ever noticed strange location markers on your Google timeline, even though you haven’t been anywhere near that place? If so, your Google Location History may be to blame.\nMany people are unaware that Google tracks their location history, an electronic record of everywhere they have been while carrying their smartphone, tablet or laptop. This data can reveal intimate details about their daily routines, activities, and interests. But, fortunately, controlling Google Location History is not too difficult once you know how it works.\nIn this article, we will unveil the secret to controlling your Google Location History, including how it works, how to view it, download it, and delete individual or entire sections of it.\nSection 1: What is Google Location History?\nGoogle Location History is a feature of Google Maps that tracks your location, using GPS and Wi-Fi signals from your device. It creates a history of where you’ve been, when you were there, and how long you stayed. This data is saved to your Google account, and it can be viewed, downloaded, or erased at any time.\nGoogle uses this data to personalize your search results and provide location-based services. For example, Google can predict your commute, estimate your travel time, recommend nearby restaurants, or show you weather updates for your location. However, this tracking can also raise privacy concerns, especially if someone else gains access to your account or device.\nSection 2: How to view your Google Location History\nTo view your Google Location History, you need to log into your Google account and access your Timeline. Here’s how:\nOpen Google Maps on your device or computer.\nClick on the three horizontal lines (menu icon) on the top-left corner of the screen.\nSelect “Your Timeline” from the drop-down menu.\nYou will see a map of your location history, with pins and routes showing where you’ve been on specific dates or ranges of time.\nYou can zoom in or out, move the map around, or change the date range to see more or less detail.\nYou can also click on each pin to see the name of the place, the time you were there, and the mode of transportation you used (walking, driving, cycling, etc.)\nSection 3: How to download your Google Location History\nIf you want to keep a copy of your Google Location History for your records or analysis, you can download it as a KML file or a CSV file. Here’s how:\nGo to your Google Location History timeline as described in Section 2.\nClick on the gear icon on the bottom-right corner of the screen.\nSelect “Download a copy of your data” from the pop-up box.\nYou can choose to export all your data or select specific products, such as Google Maps, Google Drive, or YouTube.\nYou can also choose the file type and size, as well as the delivery method (email or cloud storage).\nAfter you confirm the export, Google will generate a link to the file, which you can access and download within a few hours or days.\nSection 4: How to delete your Google Location History\nIf you want to erase all or some of your Google Location History, you can do so from your Timeline settings. Here’s how:\nGo to your Google Location History timeline as described in Section 2.\nClick on the gear icon on the bottom-right corner of the screen.\nSelect “Settings” from the pop-up box.\nYou can turn off location tracking by toggling off the “Location History” option.\nYou can also delete parts of your history by selecting “Delete all Location History” or “Delete Location History range.”\nYou can choose the date range or location range to delete, and confirm the deletion.\nNote that deleting your Google Location History does not affect your Google Maps search history, which is a separate feature.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, controlling your Google Location History is essential to protect your online privacy and security. By knowing what it is, how it works, and how to manage it, you can enjoy the benefits of location-based services without compromising your personal data. We hope this article has helped you understand and master the secret to controlling your Google Location History once and for all!\nAdmit it, we all have been (or go regularly often) to the places which we don’t want others to know. Nowadays, wherever we go, we carry our Android smartphone with us. This is because we have come to the age that we can live without anything, but not the smartphone. And yes, our smartphone tracks our location. That can be easily turned off with just a tap, but as it is useful most of the times, we might not want to do it.\nSo, here we are going to discuss about how to manage your google location history in your smartphone.\nBefore getting started, you might want to take a look at our previously published posts, which are related to this stuff:\nHow to remove the Google Search Bar from Homescreen of your Android? How to clear search history from the Google Play Store? How to clear Search and Location History in Google Maps? You can view, edit, enable or disable or pause your Location history from your PC. To view this or know more, follow this link.\nWhat do these all stand for:\nLocation History: This is the record of where you have been until the very moment that you’ve checking in. Google has tracked you (your smartphone’s location) every 45 seconds while you are travelling, and little less frequently if you are in rest. Note that you should have turned on your location (GPS) settings in your smartphone or whatever for this. Enable Location History: If you have never visited the location history site before (follow the link above), you don’t have the data saved for this. To start saving your location history, you must enable and you can see that in the site if you are visiting it for the first time. Pause location History: Google will stop saving your location history for a while, until you actually resume it yourself. If you want Google to not show you two days later where you are going immediately after, you can pause the location. You can also save your home and work history there. For that, go to Home and Work section in the bottom left corner, and click on ‘add your home address’, or ‘add your work address’, which ever you want to. You will get a pop-up to add your address, with an option to save it.\nIn the right, you will have the ‘delete location history’ option. Click on this to have all your location history erased. Remember that you will not have any option to backup your data before you delete all, so be careful on that (this means be clear if you really want to erase all or keep it).\nThe ‘Pause Location History’ can also be done directly from your smartphone with just a tap. If you are not active on other devices and just on your smartphone, all you have to do is just to turn off the Location Settings of your smartphone. Go to Settings » Location on your phone’s menu for that.\nHave something to add to the story?
