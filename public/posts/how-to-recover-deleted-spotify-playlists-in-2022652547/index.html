Here’s the ultimate guide to recovering your deleted playlists in 2022! It’s a nightmare for any music lover to lose their favorite songs and playlists on Spotify. It’s even worse when you accidentally delete them, and there seems to be no way to get them back. But don’t worry, we’ve got you covered with the ultimate guide to recovering your deleted playlists on Spotify in 2022.\nStep 1: Check your Trash folder Spotify has a feature that allows deleted playlists to be moved to a trash folder. This means you may still have a chance to recover your playlists without too much hassle.\nTo check your trash folder, go to your Spotify account and click on the three dots next to your account name. From there, select ‘Settings’ and then ‘Account Settings.’ You should be able to see the ‘Recover playlists’ option within the ‘Restore music’ section.\nStep 2: Contact Spotify Support If your playlists aren’t in the trash folder, you need to reach out to Spotify Support. You can do this through their website or social media platforms such as Twitter. Explain the situation and provide as much information as possible, such as the name of the playlist, when it was deleted, and any other relevant details.\nSpotify has a great support team, and they will do their best to help you recover your deleted playlists. Be patient and follow their instructions, and you may be able to get your playlists back in no time.\nStep 3: Use Third-Party Tools If all else fails, you can try using third-party tools to recover your deleted playlists. Some of the tools available include EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard, Disk Drill, and Recuva.\nThese tools work by scanning your hard drive and retrieving any files that have been deleted. However, they are not always 100% reliable, and there is always a chance that you may not recover everything you lost.\nFinal thoughts Losing your favorite songs and playlists on Spotify is a frustrating experience. However, there are steps you can take to recover them, such as checking your trash folder, contacting Spotify support, or using third-party tools.\nRemember to take care when deleting playlists, and always double-check before clicking that ‘Delete’ button. With a little bit of effort and patience, you may be able to get your lost songs back and get back to jamming to your favorite tunes.\nIf you use Spotify to feed your thirst for music, you might already know about Spotify Playlists. You can create as many playlists as you want on both Spotify, free \u0026 premium, and you can even share them with your friends and family. As an active Spotify user, you’ve likely deleted one or two playlists in the past and regretted doing so later. If this has already happened or happens with you very often, it’s best to know how to recover deleted Spotify Playlists.\nThings to Remember Before Recovering Spotify Playlist Spotify provides you an option to recover deleted playlists, but there’s a catch. You can only recover a playlist that has been deleted within the last 90 days. If you have deleted a playlist before 3 months, you can’t get it back on your account. Another important thing you should note is Spotify’s playlist recovery option is only accessible from the web player. You can’t use the Spotify mobile or desktop app to recover your deleted playlists.\nSteps to Recover Deleted Spotify Playlists You don’t need to use third-party apps or message the Spotify Support team to recover the deleted playlists. You need to follow some of the simple steps shared below.\nOpen your favorite web browser and Spotify’s Account Overview Page. Next, log in to your Spotify account.\nOn the right pane, click on the Recover Playlists option.\nOn the left, you will see the Recover Playlists page. The page will list all playlists that you can restore.\nClick the Restore button behind the Playlist name to restore it to your account.\nOnce restored, the Restore button will change to Restored. This indicates that your playlists have been restored to your Spotify profile.\nThat’s it! This is how you can recover lost or deleted Spotify Playlists on your desktop.

You can only restore the deleted playlists within 90 days. If 90 days have passed, you have no option to recover the playlists.
