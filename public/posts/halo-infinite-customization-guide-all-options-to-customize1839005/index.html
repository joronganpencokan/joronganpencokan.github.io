Looking to customize your Spartan in the most complete and comprehensive way possible? Look no further, as we have compiled an ultimate guide to every customization option available in Halo Infinite.\nFrom armor coatings to emblems, visors, helmets, and more, we’ve got you covered with all the information you need to make your Spartan stand out from the crowd.\nArmor Coatings First up, let’s talk about armor coatings. These are essentially skins or color schemes that you can apply to your Spartan’s armor. Halo Infinite features a wide range of armor coatings, and each one has its own unique style and color palette.\nTo get to the armor coatings option, access the “Armor” tab in the customization menu. You can then cycle through the available coatings and preview them on your Spartan to see which one you like the best.\nSome of the coolest armor coatings include the Atriox Ravager, Azure Halo, and Tundra Slayer. You can also purchase additional armor coatings through the in-game store, or by completing various challenges and achievements.\nEmblems Emblems are another way to customize your Spartan’s appearance, and they appear on your Spartan’s armor and banner during matches. To access the emblems menu, go to the “Player ID” tab in the customization menu.\nThere are many emblems to choose from, including classic Halo emblems like the UNSC logo, as well as new emblems unique to Halo Infinite. You can also customize the colors and border of your emblem to make it more distinct.\nVisors Visors are essentially the color of the visor that appears on your Spartan’s helmet. These can be accessed through the “Armor” tab in the customization menu, and there are many different colors to choose from.\nSome of the best visors in the game include the Recon Visor, HCS Pro, and VIP. You can also unlock additional visors through gameplay progress, and by completing challenges and achievements.\nHelmets Last but not least, helmets are another key aspect of Spartan customization. Each helmet has its own unique style and design, and can be accessed through the “Armor” tab in the customization menu.\nSome of the coolest helmets in Halo Infinite include the HCS Ogre, Recon, and Athlon. You can also customize the attachments and colors of your helmet to add even more detail.\nConclusion There you have it, an ultimate guide to customizing your Spartan in Halo Infinite. With so many options to choose from, you can truly unleash your inner Spartan and create a unique look that sets you apart from the rest.\nTake the time to experiment with different armor coatings, emblems, visors, and helmets until you find the perfect combination that suits your style. With all these customization options, the possibilities are endless!\nIf you have been playing and enjoying the Halo Infinite multiplayer beta so far then let me teach you how you can customize your armor sets and make your Spartan the way you want him/her to look like. This is going to be your one-stop guide for all your Halo Infinite customization needs.\nHalo Infinite Customization Guide Halo Infinite offers more choice and freedom when it comes to character customization compared to the previous games. The usual suspects are all here, your emblems, nameplate and character cards etc. are all here and all of them are bigger and better than ever. But, this time around, that’s not where it all stops as there’s much, much more. Since we are only in Season 1, the options are somewhat limited but the foundation is solid. We can already see how robust the customization options are already and there’s no doubt, as the game’s life cycle will progress, it’ll keep getting better and better.\nThese listed elements can be individually customized in Halo Infinite:\nArmor Kit Armor Coating Helmet Visor Chest Right Shoulder Left Shoulder Gloves Hip Knee Pads Right off the bat, you have three armor cores you can pick and choose from –\nMark VI – Default armor set Mark V[B] – Unlocked through the Battle Pass. Yorou – Unlocked during the “Fractures Tenrai” Event. Granted, you don’t have access to all of them immediately and will only be able to grab them once the season starts progressing, this gives you an idea of what the future holds. This has been the base armor, now let’s move further into the customization options.\nHalo Infinite comes with something called ‘armor cores’, which you can unlock and which, in turn, will give you access to other armor pieces. From your visor to your head and knee and shoulder pads. This system brings some much-needed complexity and flexibility towards how you want your Spartan to look. Right now the cores are somewhat restrictive towards ceratin armor sets but 343 has said that this may change in the future. Not only do you have armor cores, but you also have weapon and vehicle cores which, as the name suggests, will help you with your weapon and vehicle customization needs.\nYou can also add prosthetic limbs to your Spartans which makes them look all the more badass. Then you have armor coatings which is the armor coloring system. Armor coating lets you color your Spartan armor in the colors you like. There are presets available with multiple color options that you can pick and choose from which will give your Spartan the personal touch you seek.\nAlso Read | Halo Infinite Armor Coating Skin Redeem Codes\nIndividual armor pieces can be unlocked through the Halo Infinite battle pass which needs to be bought. There’s a free tier for the battle pass which doesn’t offer much but the paid premium tier nets you a whole bunch of armor options that you can unlock by hitting certain ranks. Every Spartan also comes with their own personal AI that is also somewhat customizable from their voice to their color. This adds a small layer of personality and character to your Spartan.\nFinally, you can also buy armor sets that are available on the storefront for some cash.\nJust a quick recap, Halo Infinite offers a lot of customization and personality for your Spartan and you have a lot more options and flexibility in Halo Infinite than you have in previous Halo games.\nThere you have it, a quick and simple tour/ guide for all the customization options available in Halo Infinite right now. There’s no doubt the list and options will grow and grow as the game moves forward and you can bet we’ll be there to cover it all!
