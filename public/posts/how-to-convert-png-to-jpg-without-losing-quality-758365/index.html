Unfortunately, converting a PNG to a JPG often leads to a loss of quality, leaving the image looking blurry or pixelated.\nBut fear not, we have a secret hack that will allow you to convert your PNGs to JPGs like a pro without compromising the quality of the image!\nStep 1: Use the right software\nThe first step in converting a PNG to a JPG without compromising quality is to use the right software.

Don’t worry in this guide we will discuss how you can convert PNG to JPG without losing quality.\nWhen dealing with images in Windows OS there are certain file formats that Windows use. The most popular among them are the PNG \u0026 JPG/JPEG format. But as these two formats have different use cases, you need to understand which format to use when.\nFor instance, you are sharing a picture that only contains text then you should prefer PNG format while on the other hand if you are sharing a portrait then you should use the JPG format.

While on the other hand, the PNG format uses a lossless compression algorithm that keeps all the information thus preserving the quality of the image but that automatically increases the file size. JPG files can be compressed to save more space on your disk while the PNG files guarantee the quality of the image. Both formats have their pros and cons, but if you want the JPG file to have the same quality as the PNG file format then it can also be achieved by converting the PNG file to JPG without losing quality with the help of the below-listed methods.\nHow to Convert PNG to JPG without Losing Quality Method 1: Microsoft Paint to Convert PNG to JPG To convert PNG to JPG the Microsoft paint is a very handy tool.
