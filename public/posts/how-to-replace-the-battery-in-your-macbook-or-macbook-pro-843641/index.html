Are you a Macbook lover who is fed up with constantly having to deal with dead batteries? You’re not alone. While Apple’s laptops are known for their sleek design and impressive performance, their battery life leaves much to be desired. Fortunately, there is a simple DIY fix that can help you extend your Macbook’s battery life and avoid the frustration of dead batteries once and for all.\nThe Problem: Short Battery Life First, let’s look at the problem. Macbook batteries are notoriously short-lived, especially with heavy use. While Apple claims that their laptops can last up to 12 hours on a single charge, the reality is often much less than that. Many users find themselves struggling to make it through even half a workday without having to plug in their laptop.\nThere are a few reasons why Macbook batteries tend to die quickly. First and foremost is the fact that they are made with lithium-ion technology, which means that they degrade over time. Additionally, many users keep their laptops plugged in even when they’re not using them, which can damage the battery and cause it to lose its ability to hold a charge.\nThe Solution: DIY Battery Replacement So what can you do to extend your Macbook’s battery life? The answer is simple: replace the battery. While Apple doesn’t make it easy to replace the battery on their laptops, it is possible to do it yourself with some basic tools and a bit of know-how.\nHere’s what you’ll need to do:\nPurchase a replacement battery. You can find these online or at electronics stores. Make sure you get one that is compatible with your specific Macbook model.\nPower down your Macbook and unplug it.\nUse a screwdriver to remove the screws on the bottom of the laptop.\nCarefully remove the bottom cover of the laptop to reveal the internal components.\nLocate the battery and disconnect the cable that connects it to the logic board.\nRemove the screws that hold the battery in place and carefully lift it out of the laptop.\nInsert the new battery and screw it back into place.\nReconnect the cable that connects the battery to the logic board.\nReplace the bottom cover of the laptop and screw it back into place.\nPower on your Macbook and enjoy your extended battery life!\nThe Benefits: Extended Battery Life and Cost Savings By replacing your Macbook’s battery yourself, you can not only extend the life of your laptop but also save money in the long run. Apple charges exorbitant prices for battery replacement, often upwards of $200. By doing it yourself, you can purchase a replacement battery for a fraction of the cost and avoid having to pay for labor.\nAdditionally, replacing your battery is a great way to give your Macbook a new lease on life. If you’re considering upgrading to a new laptop because your battery life is too short, a simple battery replacement can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars.\nConclusion If you’re a Macbook lover who is tired of dealing with dead batteries, it’s time to take matters into your own hands. By following the simple steps outlined above, you can replace your Macbook’s battery yourself and enjoy extended battery life and cost savings. So what are you waiting for? Get started on your DIY battery replacement today and say goodbye to dead batteries for good!\nBut you don’t have to buy a new MacBook when the battery is worn. You don’t even have to take it to an Apple Store for a genius to wave their magic wand over it. You can, in fact, replace the battery yourself. Also: How to record calls on your iPhone\nReplacing the battery in your MacBook or MacBook Pro Materials needed: Battery replacement kitA clear workspace\nEstimated time: 30 minutes The MacBook going under the knife for this article was a mid-2012 13-inch A1278 MacBook Pro that has nearly 2,000 recharge cycles on the battery, which is well over the rated 1,000 which Apple considers as its limit. Note: There are different battery kits for different MacBook models, so it’s important to choose the right kit for your device. Do this by searching for the model number (found on the bottom on the laptop, and it follows the format Axxxx where xxxx are four digits). The kit I bought consisted of a replacement battery, and all the tools needed to carry out the replacement. In this case, the tools that came with the kit were as follows:\nPlastic spudgerPrecision bit driverThree 4mm precision bits – Pentalobe P6, Phillips #00, Tri-point Y0 (for this job I did not need the P6 bit, as this is used on later models that the kit covers)\nThe replacement process is quick and simple. iFixit has detailed repair guides that are easy to follow. I’m familiar with the process so the whole thing took me about five minutes on a kitchen table, with no electrostatic discharge prevention, and just a tablecloth underneath the MacBook. If this is your first time, I suggest putting aside 30 minutes. The job essentially consists of these steps:\nPower down the MacBook.Undo the screws holding down the back cover.Unplug the battery from the motherboard.Remove the screws holding down the battery.Lift the battery out of the MacBook.Fit new battery.Screw the battery down.Refit the connector.Fit the back cover.Test the MacBook.\nTips If you’re doing this for the first time, here are my top tips:\nGet the iFixit’s “Fix Kit” so you have the right tools (this is not a job for cheapo tools, or big honking household screwdrivers)Read the appropriate iFixit repair guide.Put the screws in a pot so they don’t get scattered to the four winds.You will be dealing with screws of varying lengths, so either make a note of which goes where, or use your smartphone to take pictures.Take your time, and enjoy the process!\nHow to tell if your battery needs to be replaced Want to check if your battery needs replacing? There are two ways.\nThe simple way: Press and hold down the Option key while clicking the battery icon in the status bar.The battery health will appear at the top of the list, and will be listed as Normal, Replace Soon, Replace Now, or Service Battery.\nA longer-winded method: Click the  in top left corner. Click About This Mac.Click System Report…In the left-hand menu, click Power.Here you will find detailed information about your battery. ","wordCount":"1084","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-31T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-31T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mickie Jones"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-replace-the-battery-in-your-macbook-or-macbook-pro-843641/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Macbook Lovers, Say Goodbye to Dead Batteries with This Ultimate DIY Fix!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 31, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1084 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mickie Jones</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#the-problem-short-battery-life>The Problem: Short Battery Life</a></li><li><a href=#the-solution-diy-battery-replacement>The Solution: DIY Battery Replacement</a></li><li><a href=#the-benefits-extended-battery-life-and-cost-savings>The Benefits: Extended Battery Life and Cost Savings</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li><li><a href=#replacing-the-battery-in-your-macbook-or-macbook-pro>Replacing the battery in your MacBook or MacBook Pro</a><ul><li><a href=#materials-needed>Materials needed: </a></li><li><a href=#estimated-time-30-minutes>Estimated time: 30 minutes </a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#tips>Tips</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-tell-if-your-battery-needs-to-be-replaced>How to tell if your battery needs to be replaced</a><ul><li><a href=#the-simple-way>The simple way:</a></li><li><a href=#a-longer-winded-method>A longer-winded method:</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=macbook-lovers-say-goodbye-to-dead-batteries-with-this-ultimate-diy-fix>Macbook Lovers, Say Goodbye to Dead Batteries with This Ultimate DIY Fix!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#macbook-lovers-say-goodbye-to-dead-batteries-with-this-ultimate-diy-fix>#</a></h1><p>Are you a Macbook lover who is fed up with constantly having to deal with dead batteries?
