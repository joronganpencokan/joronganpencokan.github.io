If there’s one thing that we know about Google, it’s that they never cease to amaze us with their cutting-edge technology and game-changing innovations. Every year, Google holds its annual I/O developer conference, where it unveils its latest and greatest innovations to the world. This year, Google I/O 2017 brought to us some mind-blowing technology that is set to transform the way we think about the world around us.\nOne of the major announcements at Google I/O 2017 was Google Lens, an augmented reality platform that allows users to use their phone’s camera to identify objects and locations in real-time. Imagine walking down a street and pointing your phone at a restaurant, and Google Lens automatically identifying the restaurant and displaying its menu, customer reviews, and opening hours. Or pointing your phone at a flower and seeing information about the species of the flower, its growth patterns, and where you can buy seeds to grow your own. Google Lens is set to revolutionize the way we interact with the world, and it’s exciting to see just how far augmented reality has come.\nAnother exciting announcement at Google I/O 2017 was the Google Assistant’s new conversational capabilities. In the past, the Google Assistant has been limited to answering specific questions and commands, but with its new conversational features, it is now possible to have more natural and fluid interactions with the Assistant. For example, you could ask the Assistant to recommend a restaurant for dinner, and it would respond with several options. If you asked follow-up questions, such as “what’s the ambiance like?”, the Assistant would be able to understand the context of the conversation and provide relevant answers. This feature is a significant step towards more natural and human-like interactions with technology.\nGoogle’s commitment to the environment was also on display at Google I/O 2017. The company announced that it has invested in several new renewable energy projects, including a wind farm in Oklahoma and a solar project in Chile. These projects bring Google’s total renewable energy investment to over $3.5 billion, making it the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world. Google’s approach to sustainability is a game-changer for the tech industry, and it will no doubt inspire other companies to follow suit.\nFinally, Google’s efforts to make technology more accessible were showcased at Google I/O 2017. The company announced that it is working on a new accessibility feature for Android called “Project Euphonia”. This project aims to use machine learning to help people with speech impairments communicate more effectively. By analyzing the unique patterns and rhythms of an individual’s speech, Project Euphonia will be able to translate their speech into more coherent and understandable language. This feature could potentially transform the lives of millions of people with speech impairments, giving them greater independence and empowering them to communicate more effectively.\nIn conclusion, Google I/O 2017 was an exciting event that showcased some truly cutting-edge technology and game-changing innovations. With Google Lens bringing augmented reality to the masses, the Google Assistant’s new conversational features, Google’s renewed commitment to the environment, and Project Euphonia’s efforts to make technology more accessible, the future of technology looks more exciting than ever before. We can’t wait to see what Google has in store for us next!\nDuring Google’s annual I/O developer conference keynote, the company made a long list of announcements, including advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to make search more relevant and Google Assistant more conversational. Google also highlighted a number of new features coming to Android O and showed off Android Go for entry-level devices, and a lot more.\nIf you missed the Google I/O 2017 keynote, here’s a list of the most important announcements.\nGoogle I/O announcements Android has more than 2 billion active users Google’s CEO Sunder Pichai announced that Android keeps growing, and it has already surpassed 2 billion active devices, combining phones, tablets, Android TV, Android Wear accessories, and numerous other devices.\nAndroid O now on beta Google is making available Android O as a preview for testers.

Of course, the mobile OS isn’t ready, but you can install it in a spare device to test the latest features.\nAndroid Go for low-end devices Alongside Android O, Google also announced Android Go, but it’s not a new version of the mobile OS. Instead it’s optimized version of Android O to run on entry-level devices with less than 1GB of RAM and for data-restricted environments.\nDevices with Android Go configuration will also get access to a tweak version of the Google Play Store that highlights apps optimized to reduce battery consumption and data usage.\nGoogle Lens Google also announced Lens a new feature for Google Assistant that using advanced AI and deep learning can recognize the world around you. Using Google Lens, you can, for example, point the camera to a flower and the assistant will be able to give you information about it.\nOr you can point the camera to your router, and it’ll be able to identify the username and password to get you connected online.\nGoogle Assistant comes to iPhone Google Assistant is no longer tight to Android devices, the company has now announced that you can now install and use Google Assistant on your iPhone. However, you won’t be able to change Siri as your default assistant.\nIn addition, Google said that the assistant will be available in more languages, including in German and French.\nGoogle Home gets hands-free calling Google Home will receive an update that will allow you to call anyone to a landline or cell phone hands-free using your voice — no phone require. Google Home by default will use a private number to call anyone in your contacts, but you can connect your mobile number if you want.\nThe best part is that it’ll recognize your voice when placing a call, so that if you say “Hey Google, call mom,” it’ll call your mom. But if someone else say the same command, Google Home will call their respective mom.\nGoogle Photos is more useful The company announced that a number of features coming to Photos, including Suggested Share, which is a feature that suggests what photos should share and with whom you share them. In addition, you’ll also get the ability to automatically share a library with a feature called Shared Libraries.\nGoogle VR standalone headsets Google will also start offering standalone virtual reality headsets. The search giant revealed that upcoming headsets from partners including HTC and Lenovo won’t require a phone or computer to power the user’s VR experience.\nGoogle’s TPU chips During Google I/O 2017, the company unveiled its second version of its Tensorflow Processing Unit (TPU), called the Cloud TPU.\nThis is the kind of hardware Google uses for Tensorflow, which is its open-source machine learning software, and developers can use to build their own apps and AI-powered tools.\nGoogle Jobs Google has also decided to take on Microsoft’s LinkedIn with a new search engine for job listing.\nFor example, if you search for “retail jobs,” Google will intelligently show the relevant jobs available in your area.\nYouTube Super Chat If you’re a YouTuber that regularly watch live streams, you’ll be able to pay to have your comment highlighted in a big way as a “Super Chat” comment. This new feature makes the comment standout above the rest, and it’ll help creators make more money.\nHere’s the full Google I/O 2017 keynote:\n","wordCount":"1263","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Herbert Ahmed"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/google-i-o-2017-the-biggest-announcements-1977753/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Breaking News: Google I/O 2017 Unveils Mind-Blowing Technology and Game-Changing Innovations!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 9, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1263 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Herbert Ahmed</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#google-io-announcements>Google I/O announcements</a><ul><li><a href=#android-has-more-than-2-billion-active-users>Android has more than 2 billion active users</a></li><li><a href=#android-o-now-on-beta>Android O now on beta</a></li><li><a href=#android-go-for-low-end-devices>Android Go for low-end devices</a></li><li><a href=#google-lens>Google Lens</a></li><li><a href=#google-assistant-comes-to-iphone>Google Assistant comes to iPhone</a></li><li><a href=#google-home-gets-hands-free-calling>Google Home gets hands-free calling</a></li><li><a href=#google-photos-is-more-useful>Google Photos is more useful</a></li><li><a href=#google-vr-standalone-headsets>Google VR standalone headsets</a></li><li><a href=#googles-tpu-chips>Google’s TPU chips</a></li><li><a href=#google-jobs>Google Jobs</a></li><li><a href=#youtube-super-chat>YouTube Super Chat</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=breaking-news-google-io-2017-unveils-mind-blowing-technology-and-game-changing-innovations>Breaking News: Google I/O 2017 Unveils Mind-Blowing Technology and Game-Changing Innovations!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#breaking-news-google-io-2017-unveils-mind-blowing-technology-and-game-changing-innovations>#</a></h1><p>If there&rsquo;s one thing that we know about Google, it&rsquo;s that they never cease to amaze us with their cutting-edge technology and game-changing innovations.
