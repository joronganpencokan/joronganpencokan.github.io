Fortnite is undoubtedly one of the most popular games in the world today, with millions of players continuously trying to find new strategies and tricks to get ahead in the game. As Season 2 Chapter 2 has taken the world by storm, players are excited to explore the new map, weapons, and features. In such a scenario, it’s essential to stay updated with the latest discoveries that could potentially benefit you. One such discovery is the ability to unlock any door with ID scanners quickly. This breakthrough was made by a Fortnite Pro who has shared his discovery with the world, so you too can benefit from it.\nUnlocking Any Door with ID Scanners Up until now, unlocking doors in Fortnite was a bit of a hassle. Players had to search for keys and other similar items to gain access to a particular area or room. However, in Season 2 Chapter 2, Epic Games introduced a new feature: ID scanners. These scanners could be found in various locations throughout the map and would require you to flash your ID card to open the door. After all players would gather around the door, one of them would have to stand still in front of the scanner for a few seconds, and the door would open.\nThis feature added a new level of security to Fortnite, but it was also seen as an additional obstacle by some players. That is where the Fortnite Pro’s discovery comes into play. He found that you could quickly unlock any door with an ID scanner by following a simple trick.\nThe Trick to Unlocking Doors With ID Scanners After testing it out himself, the Fortnite Pro discovered that any player could unlock doors with ID scanners by using their harvesting tool. In other words, instead of using their ID card, players could use their pickaxe to hit the scanner repeatedly. Doing this would cause the scanner to malfunction, allowing players to bypass the ID requirement and access the area behind the door quickly.\nIf you think about it, this trick makes complete sense. The ID scanners operate on a magnetic system that reads the data from a player’s ID card. Hitting the scanner with a metal object like a pickaxe disrupts the magnetic field and causes it to malfunction.\nThe Benefits of This Trick The benefits of this trick extend beyond simply bypassing the security feature of ID scanners. You can use it to gain access to restricted areas quickly, allowing you to gather resources and ammunition found in those areas quickly. It can also help you escape from a tight spot when you’re running away from enemies, as unlocking doors with ID scanners usually takes some time, which you usually do not have in battles.\nConclusion In conclusion, this Fortnite Pro’s discovery is nothing short of phenomenal and incredibly useful. By using the pickaxe to hit the ID scanner, players can unlock doors quickly, allowing them to access restricted areas or escape from tough situations. This new trick could potentially turn the tables in your favor in your next Fortnite battle. With this valuable knowledge, you can stay ahead of your competition and emerge victorious every time.\nDo you want to know how to unlock doors locked with ID Scanner? Are you stuck with the challenge – Open doors locked by ID Scanner in different matches? Well here is the answer. This Fortnite Season 2 Chapter 2 challenge might look complicated but it is actually very easy to solve. There are two ways to unlock doors locked with ID Scanners in Fortnite Season 2 Chapter 2. Both are mentioned in this guide. So let’s begin.\nHow to unlock Doors with ID Scanner in Fortnite Season 2 Chapter 2 – Method 1 The first method to unlock doors locked with the ID Scanner in different matches is to find guarding henchmen. Shoot him down but do not kill him. When he is on his knees walk near to the henchmen and carry the henchmen near the door with ID Scanner to unlock the locked door in Fortnite Season 2 Chapter 2. When you bring the henchmen near the locked door you will see a key to interact. On PS4 it is Square. Press the key to unlock the door and grab rewards inside this.\nThe only risk of using this method is you are vulnerable to attacks. When you are carrying henchmen you will be restricted to use weapons and there can be player lurking behind you. They will shoot you and grab your rewards. So beware before using this method.\nHow to unlock Doors with ID Scanner in Fortnite Season 2 Chapter 2 – Method 2 The second method is the easiest one. First, when you are in a place where you will find a door locked with an ID scanner you will have to find a Phone Booth. Phone Booth act as a place to disguise yourself as one of the henchmen in the location. Phone Booths in Fortnite are small red color cabin located in many places. You can read our guide Fortnite Season 2 Chapter 2 Phone Booth Location guide to find some of them. After finding a Phone Booth disguise as a henchman and stand right in front of the locked door. The ID scanner will think you as one of them and will unlock the door. This method is safer because you will be able to shoot down players in your way.\nYou can use these two methods to unlock doors, crates\nSo this is how you can unlock locked with ID scanner in Fortnite Season 2 Chapter 2.
