Are you tired of running out of battery on your devices while on the go? Do you worry about getting stranded with a dead car battery while on a road trip? Fear not, because the Halo Bolt Portable Charger Jump Starter is here to save the day!\nThe Halo Bolt is a portable charger that not only charges your electronic devices but also jump-starts your car battery. It features a 44400mAh battery capacity that can charge your phone, tablet, or laptop multiple times on a single charge. It also has two USB ports and a handy LED flashlight.\nBut the Halo Bolt’s real standout feature is its ability to jump-start your car battery. It comes with a set of jumper cables and can jump-start most vehicles, including trucks and SUVs, with its maximum 800-amp peak jump-starting power.\nWe’ve tested the Halo Bolt and we were impressed with its performance. It charged our devices quickly and reliably, and we were able to jump-start a car with ease. The device itself is also well-designed and durable, with a sleek matte black finish and a sturdy carrying handle.\nThe Halo Bolt is not just useful for emergencies on the road - it’s also great for outdoor adventures, camping trips, and days out. You can keep your devices charged while exploring the great outdoors, and even jump-start a friend’s car if needed.\nIn terms of price, the Halo Bolt is on the higher end of portable chargers, but its unique features more than justify its cost. It’s worth paying extra for the peace of mind that comes with being able to jump-start your car battery and keep all your devices charged on the go.\nOverall, we highly recommend the Halo Bolt Portable Charger Jump Starter to anyone who wants a reliable and versatile portable charger. It’s a game-changer for anyone who spends a lot of time on the road or outdoors, and it’s definitely worth the investment. Try it out for yourself and experience the unmatched power on the go!\nHalo Bolt Portable Charger/Jump Starter\nVersatile portable battery\nIt’ll jump-start a car\nPowerful AC port\nBright LED lamp\nComes with accessories\nLimited capacity\nNo USB-C PD port\nBulky and heavy\nWhile not the best laptop battery brick, the versatile Halo Bolt is a convenient backup for charging devices and jump-starting vehicles.\nDesign Setup Process Charging Speed and Battery Price Competition Final Verdict Specs There are all sorts of portable laptop chargers designed for smartphones, tablets, laptops, and mobile game systems, but the Halo Bolt one-ups them in one fundamental respect: it can also jump-start your car. This heavy brick of a portable charger proves to be a handy tool, especially in the car—whether for emergencies or when you need to top up a device while you’re away from home.\nGranted, it doesn’t pack as much power as some dedicated laptop chargers, which may be a better option for that need. Still, the added versatility gives the Halo Bolt a unique edge in the market. I tested the Halo Bolt for a week with multiple devices, including laptops and smartphones.\nDesign: The shiny brick While certainly portable, the Halo Bolt isn’t designed to be pocket-friendly. This big brick of a battery pack comes in at 7.2 x 1.6 x 3.8 inches (HWD) with a weight of more than 1.5 pounds. Smaller, cheaper battery packs are available for smartphones, but this beast is made for heavier-duty needs and is designed accordingly.\nIt’s made of mostly thick black plastic outside, including a glossy brushed silver top layer with an imprinted Halo logo. The front face is where most of the ports sit, including two USB-A ports (5V/2.4A), a DC input for the charging adapter, and jump-start inputs hidden behind a small door. The right side, meanwhile, has the 115V AC/65W max AC power plug input for laptop chargers and other plug-in devices.\nEach set of inputs has a power button to activate the ports, and you can use the AC input and USB ports simultaneously, but the Jump Starter can only function independently. Meanwhile, the left side of the device has a bright built-in LED flashlight with a power button, giving you another handy tool during car emergencies.\nSmaller, cheaper battery packs are available for smartphones, but this beast is made for heavier-duty needs and is designed accordingly.\nThe Halo Bolt also comes with an array of accessories, including a wall charging adapter, a car charging adapter, jumper cables, a USB-to-micro USB cable, and a cinching pouch for quick storage of all the above. All of the cables and accessories are a welcome bonus.\nSetup Process: Load it up You’ll need to charge the brick to total capacity before using it, and the four green battery lights on the right side of the front face indicate how much capacity is currently left. The battery is fully charged when all four are illuminated when pressing any of the power buttons. Otherwise, for the AC and USB ports, the Halo Bolt is a plug-and-play charger.\nThe whole process for jump-starting a car is detailed in the included instructions. The Halo Bolt has built-in safety features that ensure you have correctly aligned the jumper cables before starting the connected car, boat, lawnmower, or other vehicles.\nCharging Speed and Battery: Not so long-lasting The Halo Bolt has 58,830mWh of battery power within, and the official description suggests that it can provide up to several hours of additional usage for a MacBook Pro or iPad Air. In my testing, the results didn’t quite match those targets.\nPlugging in a mid-2019 MacBook Pro (13-inch) with its own AC adapter, the Halo Bolt charged it quickly but ran out of juice before the battery could fully recharge. It went from 0 percent to 88 percent in 1 hour and 30 minutes, at a maximum recorded charging rate of 58.29W (20.1V/1.9A).\nIn a separate test, I played a locally-downloaded movie on loop at 100 percent brightness on the laptop, with the Halo Bolt plugged in to sustain the laptop’s fully-charged battery. The Halo Bolt provided power to the computer for 5 hours, 14 minutes before running out of battery, but that’s a fair bit less than the Mophie Powerstation AC (6 hours, 22 minutes) and ZMI PowerPort 20000 (8 hours, 4 minutes) in the same test.\nNot having a USB-C Power Delivery port on the Halo Bolt is disappointing, as many modern devices rely on the standard for speedy charging. You’ll need to bring your own AC adapters to plug into the AC port to get maximum speeds.\nPlugging in a mid-2019 MacBook Pro (13-inch) with its own AC adapter, the Halo Bolt charged it quickly but ran out of juice before the battery could fully recharge.\nFor example, charging a Samsung Galaxy S10 smartphone using one of the Halo Bolt’s USB-A ports took 2 hours and 56 minutes to complete at a paltry 5.19W (4.76V x 1.09A), starting from 0 percent. However, when I repeated the test using Samsung’s charger via the AC port, it finished in 1 hour and 34 minutes thanks to fast charging—nearly half the total time.\nPrice: It’s priced right Halo Bolt ACDC 58830 vs. ZMI PowerPack 20000 But that smaller, cheaper power brick is only meant for portable devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, and handheld game systems. It has no jump-start capabilities nor an AC port to accommodate a wider array of devices.\n﻿﻿\nFinal Verdict: A convenient backup battery and jump starter. Specs Product Name Bolt ACDC 58830 mWh Portable Charger/Jump Starter Product Brand Halo SKU 811279030120 Price $100.00 Product Dimensions 7.2 x 3.8 x 1.5 in.
