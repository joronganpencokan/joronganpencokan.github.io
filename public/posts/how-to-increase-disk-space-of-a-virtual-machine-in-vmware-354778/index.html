However, its performance is limited to the storage space of your computer. Many users face problems in expanding their system’s storage. Running out of storage space on your virtual machine can be a nightmare, especially when you need to store important data.\nThe good news is that you do not have to worry about running out of storage space anymore. There is a simple hack that will help you to increase virtual machine storage space in seconds. This hack involves shrinking the virtual disk file, which can free up storage space on your computer.\nHere’s how to do it:\nStep 1: Shut down the virtual machine.\nStep 2: Open up your virtual machine hypervisor, such as VMware, and locate your virtual machine’s properties.\nStep 3: Select the virtual disk that you want to shrink.\nStep 4: Click on the ‘Shrink’ button located under the Disk Utilities tab.\nStep 5: The ‘Shrink’ process may take some time, depending on the size of your virtual disk. Do not interrupt the process.\nStep 6: Once the ‘Shrink’ process is complete, you will see that your virtual disk is now smaller. This means that you have freed up storage space on your computer.\nStep 7: Restart your virtual machine and check the storage space. You will see that the storage space has increased.\nIt is essential to note that this process works efficiently only when you have used less storage space than the virtual disk’s size. It is also recommended to back up your virtual machine before attempting the shrink process in case of any unforeseen error.\nThis simple hack has saved many users from buying expensive storage hardware. Apart from boosting storage space, a smaller virtual machine disk file also helps the virtual machine to run faster.\nConclusion\nVirtual machines are a fantastic tool, but its performance is limited by storage space. If you find yourself in this situation, don’t worry, we have a simple hack for you! By shrinking the virtual disk file of the VM, you can free up storage space and speed up your virtual machine. With this hack, you can avoid costly hardware upgrades and continue to use your virtual machine hassle-free. Try it out, and you won’t believe how easy it is!\nVirtualization software like VMware and VirtualBox provide an easy way for you to install operating systems in a virtual environment. If you are familiar with VMWare, you will know that you need to specify the maximum disk space while creating the virtual machine. This allows VMware to allot the amount of disk space required for your virtual machine. However, you can easily run out of space if you didn’t allocate enough disk space initially. Here is how you can increase the disk space of a virtual machine in VMWare.\nBefore doing anything, make sure that you have a good backup of your virtual machine as there is a good chance of something going wrong while expanding the virtual disk file. Moreover, I also assume that you know how to use regular partition management tools.\nNote: this tutorial is for VMWare. If you want to do the same for VirtualBox, here is the tutorial to resize disk space in VirtualBox.\nIncrease Disk Space from Command Line To increase virtual disk space in VMware from the command line, the first thing you need to do is to shut down or power off the virtual machine (don’t suspend it) and also make sure that there are no snapshots. If you have any previous snapshots, delete them using the VMware snapshot manager.\nNow open the Windows command prompt by pressing “Win + R” and type cmd.\nNavigate to the VMware installation folder. You can generally use the below command to do that on 64-bit systems. Do change the file path if you have installed VMware in another folder.\nNow to increase the disk size, execute the below command. Don’t forget to change the disk space (in Gb’s) and the location of the virtual disk file as required. If you have multiple “vmdk” files, then use the file that does not include -flat or -s0 in the file name.\nOnce you have executed the command, VMware will increase the virtual disk size. The increased disk space will appear as unallocated space in your guest operating system. Use the built-in partition management tool to either extend the system partition or to create a new partition for your files and folders.\nIncrease Disk Space using VMware GUI Note: though I’m showing this in the VMware Workstation, the same steps are applicable to VMware Player.\nTo increase the virtual disk space from the VMware user interface, open the VMware application, select the virtual machine and click on the link “Edit virtual machine settings.” Also, make sure that the virtual machine is powered off and has no snapshots.\nThe above action will open the virtual machine settings window. Here navigate to the “Hard disk” category and click the option “Expand” under the “Disk Utilities” section.\nAs soon as you click the button, VMware will open the “Expand Disk Capacity” window. Here enter the disk space you want in GB’s and click on the “Expand” button. For instance, I’ve entered my disk space as 16GB for my Windows XP virtual machine.\nWith the above action, VMware resizes the disk as required and displays a confirmation message letting you know the same.\nNow log in to your guest operating system and use the partition management tool to manage the new unallocated space.\nThat’s all there is to do, and it is that easy to increase virtual disk size in VMware through command line or the graphical user interface.\nHopefully that helps, and do comment if you face any problems or just to share your thoughts and experiences.\nVamsi is a tech and WordPress geek who enjoys writing how-to guides and messing with his computer and software in general.
