Whether you want to express happiness, love, annoyance, or sarcasm, Gboard has got you covered with its extensive list of emojis.\nBut knowing how to use emojis is not enough; you also have to learn how to mix and match them to create the perfect combination for any situation. That’s where we come in. In this article, we’ll show you some of the top Gboard emoji combinations that can make your conversations hilarious and unforgettable.\nThe “Let’s Get Lit” Combination If you want to convey your excitement for a party or event, this emoji combination is perfect for you. Simply type the Champagne bottle emoji 🍾 and the party hat emoji 🎉, and you’re good to go. Your friends will know that you are ready to get the party started and have a blast.\nThe “Too Cool for School” Combination This combination is perfect for those moments when you want to show your attitude and confidence. Simply type the sunglasses emoji 😎 and the laughing face emoji 😂, and you will instantly become the coolest person in the chat. Your friends will envy your confidence and wish they were as chill as you.\nThe “Badass” Combination Are you feeling rebellious or daring? Then this emoji combination is perfect for you. Simply type the skull emoji 💀 and the fire emoji 🔥, and you’ll convey to your friends that you are a badass who is ready to take on any challenge. Your friends will be in awe of you and will never dare to mess with you.\nThe “Sarcasm” Combination Sarcasm is an art form, and this emoji combination helps you master it. Type the eye-rolling emoji 🙄 and the upside-down face emoji 🙃, and your friends will know that you are being sarcastic without having to say a word. Your conversations will never be boring again, and your friends will appreciate your wit and humor.\nThe “Foodie” Combination If you’re a food lover or enjoy talking about food, this emoji combination is perfect for you. Type the pizza emoji 🍕 and the hamburger emoji 🍔, and your friends will know that you are craving some delicious fast food. Your conversations will be filled with food puns and jokes, and your friends will thank you for introducing some fun into their lives.\nIn conclusion, Gboard emojis are not just cute little pictures; they can add a lot of personality and humor to your conversations. The five combinations we’ve shared with you are just the tip of the iceberg; there are countless more combinations that you can experiment with and use to make your conversations unique and memorable. So go ahead, have fun, and don’t be afraid to use emojis. They might just be the secret to making your conversations hilarious and unforgettable.\nEmojis are a great way of adding a bit of oomph to a message. Whether you want to express adoration, mischief, or (very important) let someone know that a sassy-sounding text is all in good fun, they help make your texts more expressive. If a picture can tell a thousand words, then surely an emoji can tell … five perhaps?\nBut for a couple of years now, Google’s official keyboard interface for Android phones, Gboard, has made it possible to super-charge your emojis using little tricks known as emoji intensification and emoji combos. Here we show you how to use these to add some crazy to your texts.\nHow to Get Gboard Phones running the stock version of Android should come with Gboard integrated and ready to use. To check whether you have it, go to “Settings -\u003e System -\u003e Languages \u0026 input -\u003e Virtual keyboard,” and tap Gboard if it’s there to make it your default keyboard app.\nIf you don’t have it, you can download Gboard at the Play Store, then set it as your default keyboard app.\nEmoji Intensification Now that you have Gboard, you can start dabbling with your emojis. The important thing to do here is to make sure that you’re using Gboard’s emojis and not those of whichever app you’re using.\nIn WhatsApp, for example, tapping the emoji icon just to the left of the message box will use WhatsApps’s emoji library, which has nothing on what Gboard has to offer.\nSay you’re texting someone in WhatsApp. To use Gboard emojis, bring up the keyboard, then hold the emoji icon in the bottom-left corner.\nYou should see the Gboard emoji library now. To intensify an emoji, tap the emoji you want, and a selection of giant intensified emojis will pop up above the keyboard. Just tap the one you like (or drag to the left to see more).\nBest Emoji Combos Now for the really fun stuff: emoji combos. Gboard has a huge collection of secret intensified emojis that it generates when you type two standard emojis right next to each other. Some are pretty obvious, while others are completely wild. Here are some of our favorites.\nDouble-tapping the “cold” emoji will bring up a giant icicle.\nPoop and a pig? Why Poopa Pig, of course! I tried the poop with other animals, but sadly it doesn’t work for all of them. (To be fair, the wordplay opportunities offered by this one are excellent.)\nFor when you really need to keep a secret, the zip-mouth and “shhh” emojis should do the job.\nYou can mix pretty much anything with the puking emoji, including the sun. (You know, for when you’re sick of the sun? Or maybe sun-stroke?)\nYou can mix foodstuffs into the combos as well, with one of my absolute favorites being this rather judgemental hotdog.\nThey don’t need to involve faces at all if you so wish. Why not cook up a firestorm?\nOr express your concern about global warming with an emoji?\nThese are just examples of the weird and wonderful emojis that Gboard can create for you. Get creative with it, try different things, and see what you discover. Even if you don’t think that coffee and hot dogs go together, you may just find that Gboard will find a way.\nWant to have more fun with your Android phone?
