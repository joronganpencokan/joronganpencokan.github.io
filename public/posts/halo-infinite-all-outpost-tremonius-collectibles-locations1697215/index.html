While exploring the vast open-world environment of Halo Infinite, players can embark on exciting adventures and seek out some of the game’s best-kept secrets, including the Tremonius Collectibles. In this article, we’ll guide you through every secret Outpost Tremonius Collectible in Halo Infinite, so you can truly become a Master Chief.\nWhat are Outpost Tremonius Collectibles?\nOutpost Tremonius Collectibles are one of the hardest items to find in Halo Infinite. Hidden throughout the game’s vast open-world map, these collectibles are small items players must find to complete the game’s collectibles. Usually, they come in the form of tiny cubes, and the player must decipher clues to locate them. They can also be found in some of the most obscure locations in the game world.\nHow to Locate Them?\nAs with any treasure hunt, there’s no straight answer; players must put on their creative and inquisitive hats to locate these collectibles. Exploring every nook and cranny of the open world will eventually lead players to finding these elusive items. The game provides a map with several markers indicating possible locations of the collectibles.\nHowever, these hints offer gamers only a vague sense of where to look. The best strategy is to begin with a systematic exploration of each Outpost’s region. By paying attention to the game’s audio and visual cues, players can uncover subtle clues leading to the collectibles’ location.\nExplore Every Possible Pathway\nHalo Infinite is all about wandering around the expansive landscape filled with various points of interests. As players move around through these points, they should always take note of the different paths that open up. Players must go off the beaten path, and they’ll often find the collectibles hidden in some of the most obscure places.\nBe Thorough\nThe Outposts are enormous structures with multiple entry points, secret rooms, and hidden corridors players can explore. Every nook and cranny should be invaded if you’re looking for the collectibles. Every area should be checked, including vents, crates, and anything that has a breakable surface. Additionally, players can look up and down to locate hidden pathways and crawlspaces where collectibles may be hiding.\nGet The Best Gear\nHaving the right tools is essential, as they help players get to some of the more challenging collectibles. Players should make sure they have grapple shots to traverse tricky terrain and access hard-to-reach areas. Additionally, equipping survey chargers helps to expose any hidden locations in the area, making it easier to find the collectibles.\nFinal Thoughts\nHalo Infinite is an open-world game that offers a lot of secrets and collectibles, and discovering them all is no easy feat. While it may take time to locate them all, every Outpost Tremonius Collectible adds a sense of accomplishment in the game. So, grab your best gear, explore every possible pathway, and be thorough to uncover these hidden treasures, and unleash your inner Master Chief in Halo Infinite!\nHalo Infinite has finally released its Campaign Mode. It takes place in the World of Zeta Halo and it continues the story of the Halo Legacy from there. Outpost Tremonius is the third mission. On its playthrough and completion, you will be able to get 5 Collectibles. Each of them is scattered across the Outpost Tremonius mission area. In this guide, I will show you how to get all of the Outpost Tremonius Collectibles in Halo Infinite and also their Locations.\nAll Outpost Tremonius Collectibles In Halo Infinite Campaign There are 5 Collectibles you can get in Outpost Tremonius, those five being 3 Spartan Cores, a Banished Audio Log, and Mjolnir Armor Locker. Some of these will be found in the open while some will be difficult to find. Here are the Locations of each of the Collectibles in Outpost Tremonius in Halo Infinite Campaign.\nSpartan Cores in Halo Infinite As I have mentioned above, there are 3 Spartan Cores available to be collected in Outpost Tremonius. The first can be found right from the get-go as you enter into the Outpost Tremonius. It is in a Green UNSC container. It is at the entrance itself. The second one isn’t that far off as well. Once you open up the Bay door and reach the surface of Zeta Halo, you will find it close by. If you run behind the Bay door by going towards the right, you will find the Second Spartan Core. It will be at the far end. The last Spartan Core is found at the entrance of the building. You can reach it by following the Path under the Landing Zone. Follow it and you see the Spartan Core as you reach the entrance.\nBanished Audio Log at Outpost Tremonius in Halo Infinite From the Bay door, go down the Metal ramp. At the bottom there is a Dirt Path, follow it. As you are going forward, there will be a split in the Path. The Right Side Path will have a Metal Platform in the ground, take that Path and keep left. After a short while, you will be near some structures and you should be able to hear some Beeping noise. Follow that noise and you find the Banished Audio Log.\nMjolnir Armor Locker The Mjolnir Armor Locker is pretty easy to find. Make your way to the Landing Zone in Outpost Tremonius while going up a Dirt Path. As you are about to enter the Landing Zone, the Mjolnir Armor Locker will be on the right side. Go to it and interact with it to unlock the Mjolnir Armor.\nThese were all of the Collectibles at the Outpost Tremonius in Halo Infinite. Hopefully, this guide has helped you. You can also check our guides on Replay Missions in Halo Infinite.\n","wordCount":"985","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"John Carlisle"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/halo-infinite-all-outpost-tremonius-collectibles-locations1697215/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unleash Your Inner Master Chief: Discover Every Secret Outpost Tremonius Collectible in Halo Infinite!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 10, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;985 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;John Carlisle</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#all-outpost-tremonius-collectibles-in-halo-infinite-campaign>All Outpost Tremonius Collectibles In Halo Infinite Campaign</a><ul><li><a href=#spartan-cores-in-halo-infinite>Spartan Cores in Halo Infinite</a></li><li><a href=#banished-audio-log-at-outpost-tremonius-in-halo-infinite>Banished Audio Log at Outpost Tremonius in Halo Infinite</a></li><li><a href=#mjolnir-armor-locker>Mjolnir Armor Locker</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Unleash Your Inner Master Chief: Discover Every Secret Outpost Tremonius Collectible in Halo Infinite!</p><p>Halo Infinite has finally launched, and fans of the Halo franchise can dive into a brand new story with Master Chief.
