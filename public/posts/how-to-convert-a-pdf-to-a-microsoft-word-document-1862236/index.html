It’s a problem many people face when they receive a document in PDF form, but they need to make changes to it. Luckily, there is a simple hack that you can use that will make it easy to convert PDFs to Word.\nFirst, let’s take a look at why PDFs are so popular in the first place. PDFs are an excellent way to share documents with others without worrying about the formatting being changed. They can be opened on any device, and they will look the same regardless of which device you use. This is useful when sharing professional documents that need to look a certain way.\nHowever, PDFs can be difficult to edit. The formatting is set, and you can’t change the text or images in the document without special software. This is where converting PDFs to Word comes in handy. Word is an incredibly versatile program, and it allows you to make changes to documents easily.\nConverting a PDF to Word is easy. There are several methods you can use, including online PDF to Word converters or by using Word itself. Let’s take a closer look at both methods.\nOnline Converters\nThere are several online PDF to Word converters available, including PDF2Go and SmallPDF. These websites allow you to upload your PDF and have it converted to Word within a few seconds. The resulting Word document will contain all the text and images from the original PDF file. This method is perfect for those who don’t have access to Word or don’t want to install new software.\nUsing Word\nIf you have access to Word, converting a PDF to Word is even easier. Simply open Word and select File \u003e Open. Select the PDF file you want to convert and click on Open. Word will automatically convert the PDF to Word format, and you can begin editing the document immediately. This method is perfect for those who need to make regular edits to PDF documents.\nIn conclusion, converting PDFs to Word is a simple and effective way to transform your documents. Whether you use an online converter or Word itself, the process is quick and easy. So next time you receive a PDF file that you need to edit, don’t worry. With this simple hack, converting PDFs to Word has never been easier.\nPDFs are a fairly popular document file type and have multiple uses. They are easy to read and maintain all of the formatting when shared and opened from multiple devices. Even if text from a PDF is copied and pasted into a new file, there’s zero chance of altering the formatting within a PDF.\nUnfortunately, PDF documents are difficult to edit unless you pay for the Pro version of Adobe Acrobat. Wondering what you can do to make changes to a document when you only have access to a PDF version? You can use a conversion tool to convert the PDF to Word before editing.\nConvert a PDF to Word Using Adobe Online Converter As long as you have an Internet connection, the easiest way to convert PDFs to Word is to use Adobe’s free converter. Since Adobe invented PDF files, it’s the best converter in terms of formatting preservation and ease of conversion. The converter also makes sure everything is editable so that you can use the converted document in Microsoft Word.\nAdobe does limit the number of times you can use the tool for free, but you can easily get around this restriction by using Incognito mode on your web browser.\nFollow the steps below to convert your PDF to a Microsoft Word Document.\nPull up Adobe’s PDF-to-Word converter in your preferred web browser.\nClick on “Select a file.” You can also drag and drop the file, and if you do, skip the next step.\nLocate the file on your computer, then press “Open.”\nWait for the file to convert. It usually takes just a few moments.\nAdobe will open the newly converted Word document in a web-based editor. However, you can click “Download” to save the file and open it in Microsoft Word.\nConvert a PDF to Word With Third-Party Apps Although Adobe’s conversion tool does the best job transferring all elements of your PDF to an editable Word Document, there are several other Web-based tools that will convert files.\n1. BigPDFConverter BigPDFConverter is a free-to-use online PDF-to-Word conversion tool. Once you convert the file online, you can download your newly converted Microsoft Word Document to edit or share it with others. This tool does a fairly decent job of converting text but has a harder time with non-text elements (especially tables).\n2. Nitro PDF to Word Converter Nitro PDF to Word Converter is another website that lets you convert files for free. Unlike some of the other options, Nitro collects your email address and sends the converted file to you. Besides this minor inconvenience, Nitro’s converter works fairly well and is completely free.\n3. PDFtoDoc PDFtoDoc offers something most of the other conversion tools don’t: multi-file conversion. Instead of converting PDFs one at a time, you can use PDFtoDoc to select as many PDFs as you’d like, convert them all simultaneously, then download a zip file with all of your new Word documents in it. That feature aside, it works the same as other converters.\nFrequently Asked Questions Image credit: Daniel Thomas via Pexels. All screenshots by Megan Glosson.\nCan I open a PDF file in Microsoft Word without converting it? Yes. Right-click the PDF, then select “Open With -\u003e Microsoft Word.” When Word opens the file, it will warn you that converting the file may make the file look different.\nIn many cases, the formatting does not transfer well with Word’s native conversion option, which makes using a PDF-to-Word converter a better option.\nWhy won’t my PDF convert to a Word document? Sometimes people add security features to PDF files to prevent other people from extracting the data from the PDF. If you try to convert a PDF file with password protection or other security features enabled, it will not work.\nMegan Glosson is a freelance technology writer based in Nashville, TN.
