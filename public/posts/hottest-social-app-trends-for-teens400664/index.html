Here’s a look at the top social app trends for teens.\nWarning\nParents should be sure to educate themselves and their teens on the dangers of online child predators. YouTube You might think YouTube would be the granddaddy in this bunch, but you’d be wrong. YouTube is wildly popular with teens and tweens, who visit the site at a level that’s almost doubled in the past three years. YouTube added a strong influencer and vlogger base to what was once primarily a passive content-consumption website, and the teens love it.\nHuge variety of topics.\nInnumerable amount of videos.\nCan add commentary and reviews to videos.\nCan save videos to a watchlist for later viewing.\nMany videos have ads.\nYouTube has problems with commentary and child predators.\nNo way to really filter undesirable video topics.\nSnapchat Snapchat is a popular private messaging app known for photos and short videos that are automatically deleted after they’re viewed. For teens, this “self-destructing” feature is a big part of what makes Snapchat so appealing, encouraging them to interact more frequently, safe in the knowledge that all their previous snaps disappear.\nSimple interface.\nCan take pictures or video.\nShare your pics with friends or the public.\nFun avatars created through Bitmoji.\nMore real-time communication.\nLots of filters and lenses make chatting fun.\nIf using location services, it can be intrusive.\nAds show up in the Discover part of the app.\nSnapchat isn’t just a media-sharing app. You can even use it to send money to your friends.\nPrivacy, sexting, and screenshot saving have posed some issues for Snapchat, but it remains one of the hottest apps with teens.\nInstagram Facebook may rule social photo-sharing on the web, but Instagram is arguably the mobile social photo-sharing leader. Although it doesn’t openly share how many of its users are teens, it’s easy to see that this mobile social platform is filled with young people. Check out the photos on the Explore Page or search through some popular hashtags to get a glimpse of how young the dominant demographic truly is on Instagram.\nGreat place to share photos and videos.\nEasy to post photos and videos.\nEdit images and add filters for visual effects.\nFewer ads than its counterparts.\nEasy messaging integration with Facebook.\nQuite a few spam or illicit accounts.\nCan’t post clickable URLs.\nWhile Instagram is primarily used as an app on iOS and Android devices, it’s also possible to view your account via a web browser. Instagram also makes it easy and seamless to merge your Instagram and Facebook social lives. For example, you can direct message your Facebook friends through Instagram or find Facebook friends who are also on Instagram to follow.\nWhatsApp Lots of kids still use Facebook Messenger to get in touch with their friends, but Facebook also owns another messaging app called WhatsApp.\nEnd-to-end encryption.\nCan edit pics with clipart, filters, and more.\nApp allows two different accounts on Android.\nApp needs all parties involved to use WhatsApp.\nEarlier versions were prone to crashes.\nWhatsApp boasts 1.5 billion users as of early 2021, and the app’s users aren’t just texting. WhatsApp also lets you post status updates, send videos, share your location, and make voice and video calls over the internet. The platform is completely isolated from Facebook, so teens don’t need to worry about the two overlapping.\nWhatsApp is compatible with Android phones, iPhones, Macs, and Windows computers.\nKik Like WhatsApp, Kik has become an insanely popular messaging app for teens. It’s just one of the other fast and intuitive messaging apps used as an alternative to SMS texting, requiring only a username rather than a phone number.\nCan join public chat groups on a variety of topics.\nSearchable GIFs, stickers, and more.\nFree additional emojis available for download.\nYou can even create and send your own memes.\nNo moderation in public chatgroups.\nMessages can be slow to send.\nInstagram users sometimes list Kik usernames in the bios so that other Instagrammers have another way to contact them privately. Telegram Telegram is interesting because it does a lot more than a typical texting app, and it’s completely free with zero advertisements.\nAvailable on a variety of platforms.\nEncrypts your messages.\nNo ads.\nYou have to wait two minutes to receive an SMS code when getting started.\nThere can be problems when verifying a new phone.\nNumerous reports of long delays getting access to app.\nAll the texts and phone calls are encrypted through Telegram, and you can send absolutely any file type you want, even large ones up to 1.5 GB. This is unique to most messaging apps that support image and video files.\nThe messages are synced across all supported devices because the messages and files are stored in the cloud. You can delete texts whenever you want and make secret chats that dissolve messages on a timer. You can also address up to 5,000 of your closest friends in one single group message.\nTelegram is available on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Windows PC, Mac, and Linux. The web version lets you access Telegram from any computer without installing the software.\nTwitter Teens have taken a liking to the Twitter microblogging social network, which is a hub for real-time news and connecting with high-profile individuals and celebrities. Because Twitter is so simple to use from a mobile device, it’s convenient to access, but it’s the visual component of embedded multimedia, such as photos, articles, and videos, in tweets that attracts most teens.\nInstant gratification of newsworthy or entertainment info.\nYou can choose between top trending tweets or tweets as they happen.\nMany famous people use the app, making for interesting reading.\nGreat way to interact with your favorite TV shows via Tweet Chat.\nYour tweets can easily get lost in the shuffle.\nTweets still have a character limitation.\nHard to keep up with feed if you follow a lot of people.\nUsers can get on Twitter from their computer, phone, or tablet. See all the different ways you can use Twitter on its apps page.\nTumblr Tumblr is one of the web’s most popular blogging platforms, and a lot of teens have admitted to trading in their Facebook accounts for a Tumblr blog instead.\nCan post a blog, video, pics, and even animated GIFs.\nFreely express yourself with blog-like posts.\nSuggested posts help you find content related to what you just liked.\nFew to no ads.\nHas had problems with adult content in the past.\nTumblr has had some censorship complaints.\nHard to build a following.\nLike Snapchat and Instagram, Tumblr is largely dominated by visual content and has become a favored platform for animated GIF sharing. Although it allows its users to create blog posts in all sorts of formats, including text, audio, quote, and dialogue, it’s the visual content that makes time spent on Tumblr worth it.\nTumblr can be downloaded on Android and iOS. It also works through a web browser.\nASKfm ASKfm is a Q\u0026A-based website and app that lets its users take questions from their followers, then answer them one at a time, any time they want. It gives youngsters another reason to talk about themselves other than in the comment section of their own selfies. Although ASKfm may not be as huge as Instagram or Snapchat, it’s a good one to watch, for sure. With such a big interest from teens, it has the potential to become the go-to place for Q\u0026A content.\nInteresting way to get to know someone.\nCan ask anything.\nPhoto polls are a fun way to start a conversation.\nDifficult to find subjects you want to read.\nCan’t easily search for specific posts.\nYou have to follow at least three friends to earn “coins” for profile features.\nPotential for cruelty or bullying.\nYou can use this service on the web and through the ASKfm mobile apps.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1779","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-23T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Francis Pack"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/hottest-social-app-trends-for-teens400664/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Is Your Teen Missing Out?
