With the popularity of streaming services and the trend of home entertainment systems, it’s essential to find the perfect size TV screen for your living room.\nIn this article, we will learn how to get the perfect TV screen size for your living room. We’ve created a simple formula that will help you choose the right TV screen size based on your living room’s dimensions.\nMeasure the Distance between Your TV and Seating Area The first step in choosing a TV screen size is to measure the distance between your TV and seating area. Ideally, you want to sit at a comfortable distance, not too close or too far away from the TV screen.\nThe experts recommend that you should sit at a distance of 1.5 to 2.5 times the diagonal length of your TV screen. For example, if you have a 55-inch TV screen, you should sit at a distance of 6 to 10 feet.\nKnow Your Room Dimensions Knowing your room dimensions is crucial in determining your TV screen size. You don’t want a TV screen that’s too big or too small for your living room.\nThe perfect TV screen size should be proportional to your room size. As a general rule, larger rooms require larger TV screen sizes. We recommend using the following guide to choose the right TV screen size based on your room size.\nFor smaller living rooms (up to 150 square feet), you should choose a TV screen size between 32 to 49 inches. For medium-sized living rooms (between 150 to 300 square feet), you should choose a TV screen size between 50 to 64 inches. For larger living rooms (over 300 square feet), you should choose a TV screen size between 65 to 85 inches. Consider Your TV Screen Resolution Another crucial factor to consider is your TV screen resolution. The higher the TV screen resolution, the better your viewing experience will be. However, the resolution depends on your TV screen size.\nFor example, if you have a smaller TV screen size, say 32 inches, a 720p resolution would be sufficient. But if you have a larger TV screen size, say 65 inches, a 1080p resolution would be better.\nIf you have a larger budget, you should consider buying a 4K Ultra HD TV screen. A 4K TV screen has four times the resolution of a 1080p TV screen, and you’ll get a clearer and more vivid picture quality. However, a 4K TV screen is more expensive than a 1080p TV screen.\nTest your TV Screen Size Before you buy a TV screen size, we recommend that you test it out in real life. Visit a local electronics store and see how different TV screen sizes look in real life. You can also use virtual tools available on the internet that can help you visualize different TV screen sizes in your living room.\nIn conclusion, choosing the right TV screen size is crucial to your overall viewing experience. By following the simple formula we’ve shared in this article, you can find the perfect TV screen size for your living room. So, start measuring your living room, consider your budget, and start shopping for that perfect TV screen size!\nIn this article, you will learn the difference between the publicly advertised size of a TV screen verses the actual size of the screen. This article also explains why you should factor in the TV stand or wall mount measurement when choosing a location for your TV.\nWhat to Know\nMeasurements to know: Diagonal TV screen size, TV frame size with and without stand or wall mount, and space where TV will go.TV frames can add 1/2 to 3 inches to width and height of TV frame. Stands add several more inches.Publicly promoted diagonal screen sizes do not always reflect the (slightly smaller) viewable screen size. Just because the space you have for your TV is 55\", will your new TV really fit the space? Before you head out the door to get that great flat-screen TV deal with the ad in hand and cash in pocket, make sure it’s the size you think it is.\nHere are the TV measurements you need to know.\nDiagonal Screen Size.Frame/Bezel Dimensions with and without provided stand for platform vs wall mounting.The space your TV is going to be placed in. Diagonal Screen Size (See Our TV Size Chart) When you see an ad for a TV, the screen size is what stands out the most. The promoted screen size refers to the diagonal length stated in inches. Diagonal length is measured from one corner to the opposite corner of the screen surface (bottom left to top right or top left to bottom right).\nHowever, the publicly promoted diagonal screen size does not always reflect the actual viewable screen size.\nTo combat accusations of false advertising for flat-screen TVs, the term “class” is often used. This means that an advertised TV might be referred to as a 55-inch “class TV”. The reason for this is that the frame/bezel needs to cover a small portion of the panel in order to secure it.\nListed below are examples of standard total diagonal screen size versus actual viewable diagonal screen size (all sizes represented in inches).\nThe TV Frame/Bezel and Stand Although the diagonal screen measurement determines the relative TV screen viewing area, it doesn’t tell you precisely if the TV will fit within a given space.\nYou also need to take into account the actual width and height of the entire TV frame, bezel, and stand. Frames/bezels can add anywhere from 1/2 to 3 inches to the width and/or height of the TV frame and the stands add several more. Stands also add more depth.\nWhat this means is that whether you are ordering a TV online or before going to the store, make sure you note the listed size of the entire TV, which not only includes the screen but the frame/bezel and stand.\nIf you have some TV brands and models in mind, most manufacturers post both TV product and package dimensions on their web pages.\nHowever, even if you have that information in hand, if you are going to a store to purchase your TV, take a tape measure with you in case the TV is on display. You can then check or confirm the entire exterior dimensions of the TV.\nIf the TV is not on display, but only in a box, check the box for any listed specifications regarding the size of the TV with, and without its stand.\nMeasure the Space Your TV Is Going to Be Placed In Knowing the size of the entire TV provides the information on how much space it needs for placement, but you need to make sure that you have also measured the width and height available of the space that your TV is going to be placed in.\nIf the TV is going in an open space or on a wall, the main consideration is that there is space for the stand and the wall space doesn’t have any borders you may have to contend width.\nHowever, if placing your TV in an enclosed space, such as an entertainment center, be sure to leave at least a 2-to-3 inch space on both the left and right side as well as the top and bottom (including the stand) of the TV so it can be safely and easily move in and out of place.\nIt is also a good idea to connect everything to your TV before moving it into place, as the TV connections may be located on both the back and sides of the TV.\nDon’t forget to take both your recorded measurements and your tape measure to the store with you.\nIn addition to measuring the TV and space it is going to be placed in, it is also important to take your seating distance and viewing angle into consideration.\nHow do I measure my computer screen? When you measure your computer screen, screen size is the diagonal length from the top corner to the opposite bottom corner. It is measured in inches and is different from screen resolution, which is in pixels. Do not include the bezel around the screen when measuring the size. How do I clean my TV screen? To clean a flat-screen TV or monitor, turn if off and wipe gently using a soft, dry cloth. If needed, dampen the cloth with distilled water or an equal ratio of distilled water to white vinegar. Is there an app to measure TV size? You can use the Google Measure app to help measure your screen. If you have an Apple TV, use an app like TV Widget+ to instantly calculate screen size.
