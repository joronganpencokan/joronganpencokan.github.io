If you have an external hard drive, USB stick, or SD card that is formatted in Ext4 and you want to access it on your Mac, you might encounter difficulties.\nIn this article, we will show you how to unlock the secret to accessing Ext4 partition on your Mac in just a few clicks. With the help of a simple tool, you can easily read and write on your Linux-formatted storage devices using your Mac.\nStep-by-Step Guide\nDownload and install Paragon ExtFS for Mac: The Paragon ExtFS for Mac is a tool that allows you to read and write on Ext2, Ext3, and Ext4 file systems. The tool can be downloaded and installed for free from the Paragon website.\nConnect your Ext4-formatted device to your Mac: Connect the external hard drive, USB stick, or SD card that is formatted in Ext4 to your Mac using a cable or a card reader.\nOpen Paragon ExtFS for Mac: Once Paragon ExtFS for Mac is installed, open the application from your Launchpad.\nMount the Ext4 device: In the Paragon application, you will see a list of all the devices connected to your Mac. Select the Ext4-formatted device that you want to access and click on the “Mount” button.\nAccess your Ext4 partition: Once the device is mounted, the Ext4 partition will appear on your Mac desktop as a regular drive. You can now access, read and write data on your Ext4 partition from your Mac.\nNote: You can also use Paragon ExtFS for Mac to format your storage device in Ext4 format. This option will erase all the data on your device, so be careful before performing this action.\nConclusion\nAccessing Ext4 partition on your Mac is no longer a complex task. With the help of the Paragon ExtFS for Mac tool, you can easily read and write data on your Linux-formatted storage devices using your Mac. The tool is user-friendly, and the steps are straightforward, which is why it only takes a few clicks to gain access to your Ext4 partition.\nIf you work with Linux, you probably have a hard drive or two formatted with Ext4 or a related filesystem. Assuming you only work with Linux, that isn’t a problem. When you need to access data from that Ext4 filesystem on another operating system, you start to run into trouble.\nMacs, for example, don’t support Ext4 filesystems. If you plug a drive in, it’s simply not recognized. Fortunately, there are a few ways around this.\nThe Temporary Option: Use a VM If you only need to read a few files and don’t want to opt for a more permanent solution, there is a fairly easy solution. Just install a version of Ubuntu, or whatever your Linux distribution of choice is, in a virtual machine host like VirtualBox, then mount the drive as you would any other and read away.\nInstalling VirtualBox itself is fairly straightforward, and if you have an Ext4-formatted hard drive, you’re probably familiar with installing Linux. If not, read on for other options.\nAdd Ext4 Support to macOS If you frequently use Ext4-formatted disks and/or need to copy files from them to your macOS drive, you need a better option. You’ll need to install some software, namely macFUSE (formerly known as osxfuse) and ext4fuse.\nGo to the macFUSE website and click the Downloads tab at the top of the page, then download the latest version for macOS. This will be named something like macfuse-4.2.3.dmg.When the installer is downloaded, double-click it to open it, then double-click the icon labeled “Install macFUSE” to start the installation.\nNear the end of the installation process, you’ll get a message saying that a system extension was blocked and will be prompted to allow it in settings. Click the lock icon in the bottom left, then click “Allow.”\nNow you’re ready to install ext4fuse. The easiest way to do this is using Homebrew. Once Homebrew is installed (or if it is already installed) run the following:\nA Word of Warning While these tools can help you read from Ext4-formatted drives, they aren’t very stable. As long as you’re mounting the drives read-only, as we are in this tutorial, you aren’t risking much. If you try to use these tools to write to the Ext4 drives, you may lose data.\nIf you need to move files back and forth across a drive shared with Linux, this method isn’t recommended. Instead, use a different filesystem like ExFAT or try the commercial option listed below.\nMounting Ext4 Disks on macOS Now that you have Ext4 support installed, you need to identify the drive you wish to mount. To do this, run the following command:\nTake note of the ID for your partition, which will be something like “/dev/disk3s1.” Assuming that is the ID, you would run the following command to mount the drive:\nMY_DISK above can be any name of your choosing.\nNavigate to the “/tmp/” directory in Finder, and you should see the contents of your partition listed. If your disk has multiple partitions, you can mount them using the same steps as above. Just make sure to use different directory names to mount them.\nA Third Option that Will Cost You If you really need read/write access and are willing to pay, Paragon Software may have an option for you. The company offers ExtFS for Mac software that it claims is safe and fast. The company even says its software can repair Ext4 and other filesystems.\nWe haven’t tested this software, so we can’t say whether or not it works as claimed. It does offer a free trial, but to be safe, you may want to back up your drives, just in case. If you want to buy the software, it’s available for $39.95.\nFrequently Asked Questions 1. Can I write to EXT4 partitions with macFUSE / ext4fuse? There is experimental support for writing to EXT4 filesystems with these tools, but this can easily lead to losing data. If you’re going to do this, we wouldn’t recommend doing so with any data that you can’t afford to lose.\n2. Does macFUSE work with other filesystems? Yes. Some of the other popular filesystems supported by macFUSE are NTFS-3G, OXFS, and SSHFS.\n3. Will reading files with these tools damage my EXT4 filesystem? As long as you’re mounting partitions read-only, as we suggest in this article, you have little to no chance of losing data. That said, if you plan to move files back and forth from Linux to macOS, you may want to choose a filesystem better supported by both operating systems, like exFAT.\n4. Will these tools work with EXT2 or EXT3 filesystems? Yes. In addition to EXT4, ext4fuse supports EXT2 and EXT3 filesystems.\n5. Can I create EXT4 partitions with any of these tools? Neither macFUSE/ext4fuse or ExtFS for Mac support creating partitions. If you absolutely need to do this on your Mac, we suggest using Linux in a virtual machine environment, if possible.\nWhile Ext4 on macOS is far from impossible, it’s also frustrating since Apple doesn’t support the format. Given the company’s focus on its own technologies, we don’t expect to see this change in the near future. For the time being, it’s up to companies like Paragon Software and the open source community to keep it coming.\nGranted, Ext4 isn’t fully supported on Windows right now either. Given that company’s increasing integration of Linux into Windows, that may eventually change. For now, we have a guide on how to mount and access Ext4 filesystems on Windows.\nKris Wouk is a writer, musician, and whatever it’s called when someone makes videos for the web.\nOur latest tutorials delivered straight to your inbox\n","wordCount":"1297","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Consuelo Vargas"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-mount-and-access-ext4-partition-in-mac-1074502/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock the Secret to Accessing Ext4 Partition on Your Mac in Just a Few Clicks!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 1, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1297 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Consuelo Vargas</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#the-temporary-option-use-a-vm>The Temporary Option: Use a VM</a></li><li><a href=#add-ext4-support-to-macos>Add Ext4 Support to macOS</a><ul><li><a href=#a-word-of-warning>A Word of Warning</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#mounting-ext4-disks-on-macos>Mounting Ext4 Disks on macOS</a></li><li><a href=#a-third-option-that-will-cost-you>A Third Option that Will Cost You</a></li><li><a href=#frequently-asked-questions>Frequently Asked Questions</a><ul><li><a href=#1-can-i-write-to-ext4-partitions-with-macfuse--ext4fuse>1.
