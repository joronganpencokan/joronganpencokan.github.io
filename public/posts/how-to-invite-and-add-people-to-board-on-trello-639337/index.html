As a business owner, manager, or team leader, you’re always looking for ways to boost productivity and increase collaboration among your team members. One tool that has become increasingly popular for this purpose is Trello – a powerful productivity tool that allows you to organize tasks, projects, and workflows in a visual and user-friendly way.\nOne of the key features of Trello is its ability to support collaboration and teamwork. By inviting and adding members to your Trello boards, you can create a shared workspace where everyone can contribute to the project, stay updated on progress, and communicate with each other in real time.\nIf you’re new to Trello or haven’t explored this aspect of the tool yet, don’t worry – it’s easy to get started. In this article, we’ll show you how to invite and add members to your Trello board, so you can start experiencing the benefits of collaborative productivity today.\nStep 1: Open Your Trello Board and Click on Members The first step to adding members to your Trello board is to open the board and click on the Members button on the right-hand side of the screen. This will bring up a pop-up where you can manage your board’s membership.\nStep 2: Invite Members to Your Trello Board Once you’re in the Members section, you’ll see a few different options for managing your board’s membership. To invite new members to the board, click on the “Invite People” button in the top right corner of the pop-up.\nThis will open up a separate invite window, where you can enter the email addresses of the people you want to invite to your board. You can also customize the invitation message to include any specific instructions or details for the new member.\nStep 3: Assign Membership Permissions When you add a new member to your Trello board, you can assign them different membership permissions depending on the level of access you want them to have. For example, you can choose to make a member an admin of the board, which will give them full control over all actions and settings. Alternatively, you can make a member a regular member, which will give them permission to view and edit any cards on the board.\nTo assign membership permissions, go back to the Members section of your board and hover over the name of the member you want to assign permissions to. Click on the “Change Permissions” button that appears, and select the appropriate permission level from the drop-down menu.\nStep 4: Manage Existing Members Once you’ve added members to your Trello board, you can manage their membership status at any time. For example, you can remove a member from the board if they no longer need access or aren’t contributing to the project. Similarly, you can upgrade or downgrade a member’s permission level as needed.\nTo manage existing members, go back to the Members section of your board and hover over the name of the member you want to manage. Click on the “Remove from Board” or “Change Permissions” button, as appropriate.\nFinal Thoughts As you can see, inviting and adding members to your Trello board is a simple and straightforward process. By doing so, you’ll unlock the full potential of Trello’s collaboration and productivity features, allowing your team to work together seamlessly and achieve your goals faster.\nSo don’t wait – go ahead and create your Trello board today, and start inviting your team members to join the fun. Happy collaborating!\nTrello is one of the leading project management tools out there. It lets you organize your project in forms of boards, which can further be subcategorized into lists and cards. Basically, you can separate out the relevant aspects of a project and track their performance more efficiently. Moreover, you can add members by inviting them to a particular board, if they are also working on that project. This feature is really amazing because no matter how far all the members are from each other, they still can work together and track the overall performance.\nAnd when you add members to a Board, you can also manage that member’s permissions. Well, there’s little more to that. But no worries because we are going to clear that up in this article, along with a step by step guide for inviting members to a Board on Trello.\nInvite People To Board On Trello Inviting members to board is a very simple process, and it can be done by two methods. First one is by sending an invitation to a person through their Email ID if they are not on Trello. And if that person is already on Trello, they can simply become a member by clicking on the invitation.\nThe second method is by creating a direct Link to the Board. The link can be sent to multiple people at once, and they simply have to click on the link to become a member.\n(Note: Do note that in both the methods, if the invited person is not already on Trello, then they’ll have to sign up to become a member)\nMethod 1: Sending An Invitation First, Log In on Trello and select the Board to which you want to add the members. After getting to the selected board, click on the Invite Button. Now type the E-mail address of that person if they are not on Trello, and if they already are, then simply type their name. (Note: You can add multiple names and Email address to invite a number of people at once) And finally, click on “Send Invitation” Method 2: Add Members To Board On Trello By Creating A Link Like with the first method, Log In on Trello and get to the board to add members. Now, click on the “Invite Button” and you’ll see a “Create Link” option on the bottom right. Click on it and you’ll see a link appearing on the bar. Now, simply copy the link and share it with anyone to invite them to board. Changing Permissions Of Members Done with adding the members to the board? Now you can just follow these simple steps to change the permissions of the added members. But do note, that to do this you must have “Admin Permissions” for yourself on the Board.\nManaging Permissions Managing permissions for a new member depends on the authority/position of the person who is adding that member. Basically, there are 2 types of permission that can be given to a member to assign his position on the board.\nFirst is “Admin Permissions,” in which a person is allowed to add new members as well as manage their permissions. And the second is “Normal Permission.” For someone having normal permissions means that they are allowed to add members to the board, but not to change their permissions. Steps\nPresuming that you’re already on that particular board, you’ll be able to see Profile Icons for every member on the left of the Invite Button. Click on the Profile icon of a member to see their permissions. Then click on “Change Permissions.” By default, they’ll be having “Normal Permissions.” But you can change the Permissions Settings to Admin.
