This powerful and elusive enemy can be challenging to defeat, but not impossible. In this article, we will unveil the secret trick to summon Bell Bearing Hunter in Elden Ring and help you become the ultimate hunter.\nBefore we dive into the trick, let’s understand the background of Bell Bearing Hunter. In Elden Ring, Bell Bearing Hunter is a powerful enemy found in the Underworld, a region of the game. It is known for its devastating attacks and high health stats, making it a challenging opponent to defeat.\nSince Bell Bearing Hunter is a rare enemy, many players find it hard to locate and summon it. However, with the following trick, you can summon Bell Bearing Hunter and overcome the challenges.\nStep 1: Identify the Bell Keeper\nThe Bell Keeper is an enemy found near the Bell Towers scattered around the world of Elden Ring. It is necessary to defeat the Bell Keeper before summoning Bell Bearing Hunter. When defeated, the Bell Keeper drops a special item known as the ‘Bell Keeper’s Seal.’ This item will be crucial to summon Bell Bearing Hunter.\nStep 2: Head to the Underworld\nOnce you have collected the ‘Bell Keeper’s Seal,’ head to the Underworld region. The Underworld is a vast and dark area with winding tunnels and passages. Navigate through the Underworld, defeating any enemies that come your way.\nStep 3: Locate the Bell\nAs you venture through the Underworld, listen carefully for the sound of a ringing bell. You will hear the bell sound when the Bell Bearing Hunter is near.\nStep 4: Use the ‘Bell Keeper’s Seal’\nWhen you hear the sound, use the ‘Bell Keeper’s Seal’ to summon Bell Bearing Hunter. It will emerge from the shadows, ready for a battle.\nStep 5: Defeat Bell Bearing Hunter\nOnce you have summoned Bell Bearing Hunter, get ready to fight. The key to defeating it is to dodge its attacks and strike back when you see an opening. Bell Bearing Hunter is a formidable enemy, but with patience and skill, you can defeat it.\nIn conclusion, the trick to summon Bell Bearing Hunter in Elden Ring is not complicated, but it requires strategy and skill. With the right approach, you can become the ultimate hunter and defeat any enemy that comes your way. So, gear up, and get ready for the ultimate challenge in Elden Ring – summoning and defeating Bell Bearing Hunter.\nThe Bell Bearing Hunter is an optional boss enemy that you can find in various locations including Warmaster’s Shack (Stormhill), Church of Vows (Liurnia) and more. If you are all set to defeat him but he’s just not appearing in the game for you, check if you are fulfilling all the necessary requirements. Keep reading to know why the Bell Bearing Hunter might not be spawning in Elden Ring and what you should do to make him show up.\nHow to Make the Bell Bearing Hunter Spawn in Elden Ring? To fix the problem where the Bell Bearing Hunter is not spawning, find out if you are satisfying the conditions mentioned below:\nTable of Contents\nMake sure it is night time when you are in the location where the boss is supposed to appear. Rest at a site of grace and go from day to night. Under the Site of Grace options, find “Pass time” and choose “Until Nightfall” to change the time of day. After this, rest at that location again (yes, the second resting time is required). If you have already killed this enemy at a certain location, he will not show up again at that place. Assuming it’s already night time, rest at the nearest site of grace and exit it. If the merchant isn’t there when you reach the location where the Bell Bearing Hunter is supposed to spawn, then this means the boss is going to come out for a fight soon. How to Make Bell Bearing Hunter Show Up in Warmaster’s Shack (Stormhill) To make the Bell Bearing Hunter appear in the Warmaster’s Shack location, enter the shack to trigger it. Apart from this, make sure you have bought an Ash of War from Bernahl to trigger the appearance of this tough enemy. Church of Vows (Liurnia) Enter the Church of Vows in this location to make the boss spawn. Hermit Merchant’s Shack (Leyndell Royal Capital) If the boss is not appearing in this location, go inside the shack to see if he does. Isolated Merchant’s Shack (Dragonbarrow) Go inside the shack, come back outside to find him there. Once you complete these prerequisites, you should be able to make him appear. Be ready, though, because he will give you a hard time. Every swing of his weapon deals massive damage. When he charges at you and lands some epic long distance melee attacks, your health bar will take quite the hit. This enemy is weak to pierce damage, lightning damage and poison, though and here are some weapons that you can consider for this battle.\nPierce damage: Reduvia, Twinblade, Winged Spear, Dragonscale Blade, Black Knife and Uchigatana. Lightning damage: Bolt of Gransax, Dragon Greatclaw and Veteran’s Prosthesis. Poison effect: Serpent Bow, Venomous Fang, Serpentbone Blade, Coil Shield and Ant’s Skull Plate. Now that you know how to make him spawn check out our guide on how to beat Bell Bearing Hunter.
