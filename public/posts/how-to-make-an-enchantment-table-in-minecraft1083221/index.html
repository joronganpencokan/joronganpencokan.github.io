From building houses and crafting tools to exploring the unknown, there’s always something new to discover. One aspect of the game that many players may be unaware of is the power of magic. With the help of an enchantment table, players can enhance their tools, weapons, and armor with magical enchantments. In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to use an enchantment table to unleash the power of magic in Minecraft.\nStep 1: Build an Enchantment Table\nBefore you can start enchanting your items, you’ll need to build an enchantment table. To do this, you’ll need four obsidian blocks, two diamonds, and a book. You can find obsidian in Minecraft by pouring water on lava, and you can find diamonds by mining deep underground. Once you have these materials, place the obsidian blocks in a square shape, leaving two blocks in the middle empty. Place the diamonds in the empty spaces and the book in the top middle space, and voila! You have an enchantment table.\nStep 2: Gather Experience Points\nIn order to enchant your items, you’ll need experience points. You can gain these points by defeating monsters, mining ore, or completing tasks. As you accumulate experience points, a green bar will fill up in your inventory screen. Once the bar is full, you’ll be able to enchant an item.\nStep 3: Enchant Your Item\nTo enchant an item, place it in the empty slot on the enchantment table. You’ll see a list of available enchantments on the right side of the screen, along with the number of experience points required to activate each enchantment. Select the enchantment you want, and your item will be enchanted with that effect, such as increased damage, improved durability or enhanced speed. Be warned: some enchantments are only available at higher experience levels.\nStep 4: Upgrade Your Enchantment Table\nIf you want to unlock more powerful enchantments, you’ll need to upgrade your enchantment table. To do this, you’ll need to surround your enchantment table with bookshelves. Each bookshelf will add power to the enchantment table by providing more magical knowledge. The more bookshelves you have, the higher your enchantments can go.\nWith these simple steps, you’ll be well on your way to unleashing the power of magic in Minecraft. The game is all about exploration and discovery, and enchanted items will help you achieve your goals faster and with greater success. So, start building that enchantment table today, gather some experience points, and see what magic awaits you!\nBefore you can enchant items, you need to know how to make an Enchantment Table in Minecraft. To make the most of your Enchantment Table, you’ll also need to build some bookshelves.\nHow to Make an Enchantment Table in Minecraft You’ll need the following items to make an Enchantment Table:\nInstructions in this article apply to Minecraft on all platforms.\n1 Book2 Diamonds4 Obsidian Here’s how to collect the materials you need and how to build your Enchantment Table:\nMake a Crafting Table. Use 4 Wood Planks of any type (Oak Wood Planks, Jungle Wood Planks, etc.). Make a Book. Place your Crafting Table on the ground and open it up. In the top row, put 2 Papers in the first and second boxes. In the middle row, put 1 Paper in the second box. In the bottom row, put 1 Leather in the second box. To make Paper, put 3 Sugar Cane in the middle row of the Crafting Table. Make Leather using 4 Hides. (You can also obtain leather as a drop when a cow, mooshroom, horse, donkey, mule, or llama, or a hoglin in the nether, dies. Get at least 2 Diamonds. Diamonds appear in treasure chests, including village treasure chests and buried treasure chests on beaches, or they can be mined from Diamond Ore in desert temples, mineshafts, or underground caves. You need an Iron Pickaxe or stronger to mine Diamonds. You need either a Diamond Pickaxe or Netherite Pickaxe for the next step, so get 3 extra Diamonds to make a Pickaxe if you don’t have one. Mine 4 Obsidian. To make Obsidian blocks, use a Water Bucket to pour water on blocks of lava. Or, you can often find obsidian naturally generated underground, where water ran over lava. Then mine the blocks with a Diamond Pickaxe or Netherite Pickaxe to get Obsidian. To make a Bucket, go to your Crafting Table, put 2 Iron Ingots in the first and third boxes of the top row, then put 1 Iron Ingot in the second box of the middle row. Craft the Enchantment Table. In the top row, put 1 Book in the second box. In the middle row, put 2 Diamonds in the first and third boxes, then put Obsidian in the middle box. In the bottom row, put 3 Obsidian in all three boxes. How Many Bookshelves Do You Need for an Enchantment Table? Technically, you don’t need to make a bookshelf to enchant items in Minecraft. However, each bookshelf you add increases the level of your Enchantment Table, allowing you to create more powerful enchantments.\nMake a Crafting Table. Use 4 Wood Planks of any type (Oak Wood Planks, Jungle Wood Planks, etc.).\nMake a Book. Place your Crafting Table on the ground and open it up. In the top row, put 2 Papers in the first and second boxes. In the middle row, put 1 Paper in the second box. In the bottom row, put 1 Leather in the second box.\nTo make Paper, put 3 Sugar Cane in the middle row of the Crafting Table. Make Leather using 4 Hides. (You can also obtain leather as a drop when a cow, mooshroom, horse, donkey, mule, or llama, or a hoglin in the nether, dies.\nGet at least 2 Diamonds. Diamonds appear in treasure chests, including village treasure chests and buried treasure chests on beaches, or they can be mined from Diamond Ore in desert temples, mineshafts, or underground caves. You need an Iron Pickaxe or stronger to mine Diamonds.\nYou need either a Diamond Pickaxe or Netherite Pickaxe for the next step, so get 3 extra Diamonds to make a Pickaxe if you don’t have one.\nMine 4 Obsidian. To make Obsidian blocks, use a Water Bucket to pour water on blocks of lava. Or, you can often find obsidian naturally generated underground, where water ran over lava. Then mine the blocks with a Diamond Pickaxe or Netherite Pickaxe to get Obsidian.\nTo make a Bucket, go to your Crafting Table, put 2 Iron Ingots in the first and third boxes of the top row, then put 1 Iron Ingot in the second box of the middle row.\nCraft the Enchantment Table. In the top row, put 1 Book in the second box. In the middle row, put 2 Diamonds in the first and third boxes, then put Obsidian in the middle box. In the bottom row, put 3 Obsidian in all three boxes.\nFor a bookshelf to have an effect, there must be one empty space between the bookshelf and the Enchantment Table. To reach the maximum level (30), you’ll need to arrange 15 bookshelves around your Enchantment Table in the proper order.\nHow Do You Make a Full Enchantment Table? To make a level 30 Enchantment Table in Minecraft, place your Enchantment Table in the center of 15 bookshelves so that there’s an empty space between the table and each bookshelf. The easiest way to achieve this is to arrange your bookshelves in a 5X5 square, leaving an opening for the entrance.\nAlternatively, you can stack the bookshelves two blocks high and make a library nook.\nHow Many Diamonds Do You Need to Make an Enchantment Table? You need 2 Diamonds to craft an Enchantment Table. You’ll also need Obsidian, which requires a Diamond Pickaxe or stronger to mine, so you might as well pick up 3 extra Diamonds (for a total of 5) if possible. To make a Diamond Pickaxe, place 3 Diamonds in the top row of the Crafting Table, then put Sticks in the middle boxes of the second and third row.\nUnfortunately, there’s no way to dismantle a Diamond Pickaxe, so you can’t repurpose the Diamonds for your Enchantment Table.\nHow Do I Enchant Items in Minecraft? To enchant an item with special properties, you’ll need a Lapis Lazuli, which can be mined underground close to bedrock. Put the Enchantment Table on the ground and interact with it to bring up the enchanting menu.\nIn the left slot, place the item you want to enchant, then place a Lapis Lazuli in the second slot. You’ll be presented with three choices at random. Select an enchantment, then drag the enchanted item back to your inventory.\nThe enchantment options are based on your XP level. You’ll collect XP orbs as you defeat enemies, breed animals, mine resources, or use a furnace. The highest level enchantment you can make without a bookshelf is level 8.\nHow do I reset an enchantment table? If you don’t like the three upgrade options your enchantment table loads, you can use a workaround to “reset” them. Use a new item with the table to unload the current three options and provide three more. You can use a Grindstone to remove the enchantment from the item, or use an Anvil to place the item’s enchantment onto another item. What is the language on the Enchantment Table? The runes on the Enchantment Table are the Standard Galactic Alphabet. This language originated in the Commander Keen game series, which premiered in 1990. Each symbol directly replaces a letter in the English alphabet, so you can easily translate the runes by hand. You can also find translators online.
