This switch is located in the security room, which is guarded by multiple personnel. You can either take them out or distract them with a thrown object or a well-placed explosion.\nScoring the Evacuation Key\nOnce you have successfully triggered the evacuation, you will have the chance to get your hands on the evacuation key. This is a critical item as it allows you to access a locked room that contains valuable items and gives you an alternate exit.\nTo obtain the evacuation key, you need to make your way to the penthouse. Here, you will find a keycard that allows you to access the penthouse suite. Make your way through the suite and take out the guards until you find the safe that contains the evacuation key.\nOnce you have obtained the key, you will have access to the locked room.
