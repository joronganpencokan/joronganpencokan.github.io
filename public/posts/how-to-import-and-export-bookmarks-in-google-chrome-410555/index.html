And while there are a lot of ways to move files or data around, there hasn’t always been an easy way to transfer web pages from one device to another without sending a link via email or text. Thankfully, Google Chrome has a little-known trick that makes this process simple and effortless.\nThe trick? Sign in to Chrome with the same account on both devices. Yep, that’s it.\nWhen you sign in to Chrome using your Google account on your desktop computer, laptop or tablet, you can easily transfer your favorite websites to your phone (or another device) simply by opening Chrome on the mobile device and tapping the “tabs” button in the lower right-hand corner. From there, you’ll see a list of all the open tabs on your other devices. Simply select the tab you want to transfer, and it will open on your mobile device.\nNot only does this allow you to access pages you were browsing on another device, but it also keeps all your tabs in sync. For example, if you’re researching a topic on your desktop but need to leave the house, you can easily transfer all your open tabs to your phone and continue your research without any interruption.\nOne handy tip: if you use Chrome on your iOS device, you’ll need to make sure you have the “Chrome” app installed on your desktop as well. This will allow the syncing feature to work as intended.\nTo sign in to Chrome, simply click on the 3 vertical dots in the upper right-hand corner of the browser window and select “Settings”. From there, scroll down to “People” and click “Sign in to Chrome”. Enter your Google account information and you’re good to go!\nIn addition to being a convenient way to transfer tabs between devices, signing in to Chrome also allows you to access your bookmarks or history from any device. Plus, it keeps your browsing data safe and secure.\nSo, if you frequently find yourself wanting to access web pages on a different device, give this trick a try. It’s quick, simple and can save you a lot of time and hassle in the long run. Happy browsing!\nDo you frequently use browser bookmarks to save important information? If so, you need to regularly back up and export this data if using another desktop or mobile device. Google Chrome allows you to easily export and import the bookmarks so that you will find this data neatly organized and ready to use in another device or browser.\nApart from its own browser, Chrome supports the transfer of bookmarks across other Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge. The various methods to import and export the bookmarks are covered below.\nTraditional Method to Export and Import Bookmarks in Chrome The most traditional way to handle bookmarks in Chrome is to use the Bookmark Manager. It can be easily accessed from the three-dot menu on top.\nHere you can see a list of all your Chrome bookmarks. Again, go to the three-dot menu on top and select “Export bookmarks.”\nAll the Chrome bookmarks will be saved on your PC or laptop as an HTML file. Save the HTML file in an easy-to-remember folder such as “Downloads.”\nYou can check the attributes of the HTML file from “Properties” for size limits. If the file isn’t too big, you can email it to yourself for restoring the bookmarks on another device. Otherwise, upload the file in a cloud storage service such as Google Drive, OneDrive, Box, or Dropbox.\nOnce you have reached the Chrome browser window of your destination PC, click the three-dot menu to select “Import bookmarks” this time.\nThe HTML file can be directly uploaded, and all your previous bookmarks will show under the Imported bookmarks. This is slightly inelegant, because if you are frequently exporting bookmarks, then the data can seem repetitive on your destination device. Therefore, we will discuss another efficient method of syncing a Google account. But first we will cover the Chrome bookmark management techniques for other Chromium browsers.\nImporting Chrome Bookmarks in Microsoft Edge To import Chrome bookmarks in the Microsoft Edge browser, go to Edge’s three-dot menu and select “Settings.”\nGo to “Import browser data” to import the Chrome bookmarks. “Profile 1” will be for your Microsoft account, so it will not sync with Google.\nHere you can select the items that can be imported from Google Chrome, including favorites and bookmarks, browsing history, saved passwords, and more.\nFrom the drop-down menu, you can also select an option called “favorites or bookmarks HTML file.” This will be the HTML file that you originally created while saving Chrome bookmarks.\nThe Chrome bookmarks’ HTML file can easily be imported and adjusted into Edge browser bookmark items.\nImport Chrome Bookmarks in Other Chromium Browsers The techniques for other Chromium browsers apart from Edge are slightly different. They may not have a feature to import HTML files. For example, with Slimjet, one of the popular lightweight Chrome alternatives, a feature called “Google Smarts” allows the Chrome bookmarks and other information to be directly imported using a “Turn on Sync” feature. This requires your Google account.\nAnother popular Chrome fork, SRWare Iron, also has a Google Smarts feature to sync and personalize Google Chrome data including bookmarks.\nGet Chrome Bookmarks on All Devices with Turn Sync On To do so, open Chrome and select the “person” icon on the top right. Here you can add a persona to the Chrome profile and create a desktop shortcut for this profile. Give it a name.\nIn the next step, you will be asked to log in using your Gmail account to get access to your bookmarks, history, passwords, and other Google settings on any device.\nWhen it asks if you’d like to “Turn on Sync,” click “Yes I’m in” to enable the syncing of Chrome data on .all devices.\nOnce done, your Chrome browser will start syncing the information. The bookmarks will now be automatically imported on any other device. Clearly, syncing is the most efficient, non-repetitive way to export and import bookmarks in Chrome.\nYou can further manage what you sync for better privacy of your data. For example, you may choose to not be signed in to Google while visiting websites. If you care more about your privacy on Chrome, check these tips.\nImage Credit: Everbody CHROMERCISE!\nSayak Boral is a technology writer with over eleven years of experience working in different industries including semiconductors, IoT, enterprise IT, telecommunications OSS/BSS, and network security.
