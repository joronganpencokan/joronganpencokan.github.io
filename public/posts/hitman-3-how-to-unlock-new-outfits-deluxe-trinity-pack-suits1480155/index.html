Are you a fan of Hitman 3? Do you want to discover the ultimate guide to unlock new outfits and reveal the power of Hitman 3 Deluxe Trinity Pack Suits?\nWell, do not worry because you are in the right place! In this article, we will share with you some tips, tricks, and secrets that will help you unleash your inner Agent 47 and become a master assassin wearing the best outfits.\nBut first, let’s talk about the Hitman 3 Deluxe Trinity Pack. This pack includes three outfits inspired by different eras of Agent 47’s career. These suits are:\nThe Trinity Suit: A black suit that channels the classic Hitman look.\nThe Proletariat: A gray suit that references Agent 47’s time as a worker.\nThe All-Seeing Eyes: A white suit with a crown of thorns, referencing Agent 47’s time as a member of the secret society known as Providence.\nAll three outfits are available from the start of the game if you have the Deluxe Trinity Pack. But, how can you unlock more outfits, and what benefits do they have?\nOutfits can give you bonuses that make your missions easier, such as Intel and Weapon caches, opening up new dialogue options with NPCs, or giving you more opportunities to blend in with crowds. More importantly, each outfit will make you feel like a different Agent 47, with different styles, colors, and capabilities.\nTo unlock new outfits, you have to complete specific challenges in each mission. These challenges can be anything from killing a target in a specific way, taking a specific route, or wearing a specific disguise throughout the mission. These challenges are not always easy, but they are worth it.\nHere are some of the best outfits to unlock in Hitman 3:\nThe Classic All-Black Suit: This is the iconic look of Agent 47, and it is available in Dubai. It gives you no gameplay advantages, but it makes you look like a true Hitman.\nThe Tropical Island Suit: This is a colorful suit available in Mendoza, Argentina. It gives you the ability to carry more ammunition and explosives, making it easier to complete your mission.\nThe Phantom Suit: This is a white suit that can be found in Chongqing, China. It gives you the ability to walk through cameras undetected, making it easier to navigate certain areas without being spotted.\nThe Tactical Turtleneck: This is a black turtleneck available in Berlin. It gives you the ability to jump from any height without taking damage, making it easier to escape or approach your targets from above.\nThe Requiem Suit: This is the suit that Agent 47 wore to attend his funeral in Hitman: Blood Money. It can be found in the final mission of Hitman 3. It gives you the ability to carry more ammo and improves your speed and accuracy with pistols.\nNow that you know how to unlock new outfits and what they can do, it’s time to start experimenting and finding the style that suits you best. Remember, being an assassin is about more than just killing your targets. It’s about style, precision, and creativity. So, go out there and unleash your inner Agent 47!\nIn conclusion, these were some of the best tips and tricks on how to unlock new outfits and reveal the power of Hitman 3 Deluxe Trinity Pack Suits in order to become the ultimate assassin. We hope that this ultimate guide will help you become the best version of yourself and enjoy the game even more. Happy hunting!\nEven though you can wear the Classic Agent 47 Suit with gloves or the default starting outfit for each map, you can always unlock new outfits in Hitman 3 to disguise yourself from the beginning of each mission map. That’s exactly what we will help you within this guide. Also, we will look at how to unlock pre order bonus Deluxe Suits and Trinity Pack suits. Even though you may have the Hitman 3 Deluxe Edition, these suits are not unlocked from the beginning.\nHow to Unlock New Outfits in Hitman 3? Completing the Escalation Contracts and the challenges is the best way to unlock new outfits and better gear for Agent 47 to use in his missions. Unlocking and taking every disguise in each location helps you complete the Chameleon Challenge in Hitman 3.\nFrom your Career tab in the main menu, you can check the Challenges for every location in Hitman. We have written articles on how to complete most of the challenging ones here. Completing them grants you more XP, but Escalation Contracts generally reward you with more outfits. These unlocked outfits will be added to your collection of Suits to be worn anytime at the beginning of each mission.\nAlso climbing up more levels in Mastery progression will reward you with better Agency Pickup locations, Starting Locations, more gears, and weapons. Starting in different locations, you will be wearing a matching disguise with access to the location, making it the new default starting outfit for the mission. For example, reaching Mastery Level 4 in Dubai “On Top of the World”, will unlock a new Starting Location: Meeting Room. You will start from the staff meeting room disguised as a waiter.\nHow to Change Outfit in Hitman 3? In the Briefing tab in the main menu, you can go to the Planning session below the Objectives, and change your unlocked outfits, gears, and weapons. This option is just above the PLAY button before starting the mission.\nHow to unlock Deluxe Suits in Hitman 3 Pre Order Bonus? To unlock Hitman 3 Deluxe Suits that come with pre-ordered or the Deluxe Edition, you need to play associated Hitman 3 Deluxe Escalation contracts for them. For example to unlock Hitman 3 “The Devil’s Own Suit”, you need to complete the Escalation Mission “Asmodeus Waltz”. As compared to other games where the extra contents in a deluxe edition are unlocked from the beginning, in Hitman 3 you will be given additional Deluxe Escalation contracts to play, complete, and then unlock the Suits.\nHow to Get Preorder Bonus Suits in Hitman 3? To unlock the pre-order Trinity Pack Suits you have to complete the tutorial. That’s it, the three trinity suits will be added to your collection. You will also receive three weapons and three more matching briefcases. The Trinity Pack represents the three main suit sets from the World Of Assassination Trilogy. Hitman 1 – White, Hitman 2- Red, Hitman 3- Black.\nThat’s all there is to know about unlocking the outfits \u0026 pre-order bonus in Hitman 3.
