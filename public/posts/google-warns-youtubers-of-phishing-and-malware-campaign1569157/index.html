Google issues urgent warning about dangerous phishing and malware attack\nIn today’s digital age, the internet has become an essential tool in many people’s lives. One platform that has taken the world by storm is YouTube. With over 2 billion monthly active users, YouTube is the second most popular search engine after Google. However, with its immense popularity comes a downside: the platform has become a target for phishing and malware attacks.\nRecently, Google issued an urgent warning to all YouTubers to be wary of dangerous phishing and malware attacks. The warning comes on the heels of an increasing number of instances where hackers have targeted YouTube creators, stealing their personal information, and even their content. These attacks use various tactics to lure users into clicking on malicious links or downloading harmful software.\nPhishing attacks involve convincing a user to share their login credentials, credit card information, or other sensitive details. Hackers usually do this by sending emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate sources like YouTube or Google. Once the user enters their details, the hacker can use them to access the user’s account or steal their identity. Other methods include using fake accounts to dupe users into clicking on links or downloading malicious software.\nMalware attacks, on the other hand, involve installing harmful software on a user’s device without their consent or knowledge. This software can do various things, such as stealing the user’s data, logging their keystrokes, or even taking control of their device. The software can be installed via phishing emails, suspicious links, or even by exploiting security vulnerabilities in the user’s device or network.\nTo avoid falling victim to these types of attacks, YouTube creators need to take several precautions. First, they should be cautious about clicking on links or downloading software from suspicious sources. They should also be wary of emails or messages that ask for personal details, especially if they seem unusual or out of place.\nSecondly, they should ensure that their devices are secure by using reputable antivirus software, keeping their software up to date, and regularly backing up their data. Creators should also use strong passwords and two-factor authentication to protect their accounts from being hacked.\nLastly, all creators should watch out for any signs of a hack or data breach. These may include a sudden drop in video views or engagement, unfamiliar videos or comments on their channel, or unrecognized login attempts. If such signs are observed, creators should immediately change their account passwords, report any suspicious activity to YouTube, and consider seeking professional help to mitigate the attack’s impact.\nIn summary, phishing and malware attacks pose a significant threat to YouTubers, and every creator must take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and their content. By being vigilant and following the best practices, creators can stay safe from malicious attacks and continue to use the platform to engage with their audience and share their content with the world.\nA phishing and malware campaign has been plaguing YouTube channels, taking them over and selling them off or turning them into cryptocurrency scams.\nGoogle’s Threat Analysis Group has released a report documenting and warning against a prevalent “cookie theft” phishing and malware campaign. For several years, malicious actors have been using it as a way to hijack thousands of YouTube channels. Google states that it’s been combating the problem since late 2019 and cautions against suspicious offers for collaboration.\nThe attackers send phishing emails about antivirus software, VPN, online games, and so on, then link to or include a download for cookie-stealing malware. Typically the emails attempt to impersonate a relevant company, then direct targets to fake (but official-looking) websites.\nSites for games on Steam, companies like Luminar and Cisco VPN, and even Instagram pages have been falsified.\nOnce activated, the malware copies and uploads the victim’s browser cookies, giving attackers a way to impersonate them and take over. At that point, they either try to sell the channel (with prices ranging anywhere from $3 to $4,000), or they rebrand it to impersonate a tech or cryptocurrency exchange firm.\nFrom there, they livestream fraudulent cryptocurrency giveaways and ask for contributions.\nWhile Google states it’s been able to protect users from most of these phishing attempts or has restored compromised accounts, it also offers up some advice: Don’t ignore browser safety warnings, always perform virus scans, use two-step authentication, and look out for encrypted archives (which can avoid virus scans).\nGoogle says double-checking the email addresses of these contacts is also a good idea, as they can usually be a decent giveaway. Big companies often have their own domain names and won’t use services like email.cz, seznam.cz, post.cz, or aol.com for official business.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"794","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Marie Bates"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/google-warns-youtubers-of-phishing-and-malware-campaign1569157/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Attention all YouTubers!
