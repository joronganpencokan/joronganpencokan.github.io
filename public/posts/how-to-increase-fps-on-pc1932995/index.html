However, achieving a high FPS can be tricky, especially if you’re using an older PC or laptop. Worry not, as we have a secret trick that can instantly boost your PC’s FPS and help you dominate your games like a pro!\nBody: The secret trick is to optimize your PC’s graphics settings. By doing so, you’ll be able to increase your FPS without any hardware upgrades or expensive software requirements. Here’s how you can optimize your PC’s graphics settings:\nUpdate Your Graphics Driver: One of the most common reasons for low FPS is outdated graphics drivers. Updating your graphics driver to the latest version can improve your PC’s graphics performance and increase your FPS.\nLower Graphics Settings: Another way to increase your FPS is by lowering your in-game graphics settings. Lowering the resolution, turning off shadows, reducing texture quality, and disabling anti-aliasing can significantly increase your FPS without compromising your gameplay experience.\nDisable Unnecessary Background Applications: Running too many applications in the background can eat up your PC’s resources and reduce your FPS. Disabling unnecessary applications running in the background can free up resources, allowing your PC to focus on delivering higher FPS.\nUse a Game Booster: A game booster is a software tool that is designed to optimize your PC’s performance while gaming. It prioritizes resources for the game and disables background applications to improve your PC’s FPS.\nConclusion: By optimizing your PC’s graphics settings, you can significantly increase your FPS and dominate your games like a pro. Updating your graphics driver, lowering in-game graphics settings, disabling unnecessary background applications, and using a game booster are some of the tricks that can help you achieve a higher FPS without any hardware upgrades or expensive software requirements. So what are you waiting for? Give it a try and boost your FPS today!\nEven with a great gaming setup, there are some crucial tweaks and adjustments that are necessary if you want to increase the frames per second (FPS) rate on your gaming PC or laptop. A low FPS can make games stutter or even look blurry. Increasing your FPS means that games look better and run more smoothly on your PC. Over time, gaming systems often need some maintenance which is why it’s useful to follow these tips.\nWhile some solutions and tips take seconds to implement, others may require a bit more time to get right. Whatever your skill level or level of free time, below are a series of tips to help increase and boost your FPS on your gaming PC. How to Get More FPS on Your PC The simplest way to get the most from your graphics card and boost the FPS is to update the graphics card drivers. Updating the drivers ensures the card is using the latest software which brings with it new features, performance updates, and other optimizations.\nIf you use an Nvidia graphics card, updating the Nvidia drivers is particularly easy with dedicated software, GeForce Experience, which streamlines the process.\nOptimize Your Game’s Settings If you’re trying to get one particular game to run smoothly, look for options within the game that relate to the performance level. Look for settings like Render Distance, Texture Quality, and Shadow Depth. By lowering them, you’re likely to increase the FPS. Also, running a game at a lower resolution boosts FPS. The higher the resolution, the more your graphics card needs to do at any one moment. By lowering it, you can focus on a higher quality FPS level with a more close-up view of what you’re playing.\nDedicated tools like GeForce Experience AMD Adrenalin are also capable of making these adjustments and can sometimes do so more efficiently as they’re designed for the specific graphics card you are using. Enable Game Mode Windows 10 and above has a dedicated Game Mode that automatically makes games run faster and more smoothly. It should be enabled by default any time you load a game, prioritizing resources and deactivating background activities, but if not, you can head to Settings \u003e Gaming and check that Game Mode is toggled on to make sure it always works.\nGame Mode saves you from needing to tweak so many settings yourself, with Windows automatically optimized for gaming while it’s active.\nDefragment Your Hard Drive Data fragmentation means that data is spread across different sectors of a hard drive which means it takes your PC longer to find the relevant files, leading to lower FPS.\nBy defragmenting a hard drive, the files and data are moved more efficiently so that you gain shorter loading times as well as improved FPS.\nClose Other Apps and Programs If you’re playing a game at the same time as other apps are open, this can reduce the amount of RAM made available to a game leading to lower FPS and inferior performance.\nIf your games are installed on a Solid State Drive (SSD), you don’t need to defragment your hard drive.\nEven your web browser can use up a lot of memory, especially if you have many tabs open, so it’s important to keep as many apps closed as possible while you play a game.\nOverclock Your Hardware If you’re keen to try more advanced methods of improving your FPS, try overclocking your PC’s RAM or graphics card. Many methods are reasonably safe and a good way of getting more from your existing hardware for free, but you need to be comfortable with using your PC’s BIOS and editing some advanced settings. Overclocking is never guaranteed to work as some RAM and graphics cards may not be able to deal with the stress of it, so it can be considered a risky option. However, if you’re keen to experiment, many users can reap substantial benefits by changing internal settings.\nUpdate Your BIOS Most people don’t need to consider updating the BIOS of their PC but if they want to experiment with gaining the best performance, it can be helpful. The process involves updating the software built into your motherboard which ensures your entire PC works correctly. If the computer loses power during the BIOS update, it can ‘brick’ the PC leading it to be inoperable. The process differs depending on the motherboard involved but often requires you to go to the motherboard manufacturer’s site and find your motherboard, before downloading the update onto a USB drive. It may not make a difference to performance but in some cases—particularly when using a gaming motherboard—it can unlock more options for overclocking other components.\nBuy a New Graphics Card If you’ve tried all the above steps and your PC continues to struggle to play games at the FPS rate you want, it may be time to buy a new graphics card.\nResearch the topic and make sure you buy one that is compatible with the rest of your system. Be aware that if your system is aging, you may feel more comfortable upgrading your whole setup as well as the graphics card. To upgrade your graphics card, you’ll need to feel comfortable opening up your PC to install the graphics card. If you don’t, buying a prebuilt gaming desktop may be a better idea.\nLaptop graphics cards are much harder to upgrade, so you may need to buy a new laptop if all other tips haven’t succeeded. How do I increase FPS on a laptop? Many of the above methods will work on a laptop, including defragmenting, overclocking, closing apps, and updating drivers. You may not be able to upgrade the graphics card, but this is an option on some models. How do I increase FPS in Minecraft? Minecraft has some specific settings that may help boost the frame rate. Try going to Options \u003e Video Settings and decrease the render distance. Anything below 12 should help, but you shouldn’t go lower than 8 or so to keep it easy to get around the world. You can also set the FPS option to Unlimited, turn off V-Sync, and set the graphics to “fast,” and turn off smoothing.
