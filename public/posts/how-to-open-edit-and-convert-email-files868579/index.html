Have you ever encountered a situation where you need to edit or convert an email file, but you have no idea how to do it? Email files are not easy to work with, especially when it comes to editing and converting them.\nHowever, there is a simple trick that can help you unlock the secrets to editing and converting email files. In this article, we will explore this simple trick and show you how to use it effectively.\nUnderstanding Email Files Before we dive into the trick, let’s first understand what email files are. An email file is simply a file that contains email messages. These files usually come in .eml or .msg file format.\nEmail files can be created by almost any email client, such as Microsoft Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, etc. These files are used for archiving, backing up or sharing email messages.\nThe Problem with Editing and Converting Email Files The problem with email files is that they are not easy to edit or convert. Most email clients do not provide an option to edit or convert email files directly. This means that if you want to make any changes to an email message, you will have to copy and paste the content to a new document, edit it, and then save it as a new email file.\nSimilarly, if you want to convert an email file from one format to another, you will need to use a third-party tool or software. This can be a time-consuming process, and the results may not always be accurate.\nThe Simple Trick Now, let’s move on to the simple trick that can help you unlock the secrets to editing and converting email files.\nThe trick is to open the email file in a web browser. Most email clients allow you to view an email message in a web browser. This option is usually located in the “More” or “Actions” menu of the email client.\nOnce you have opened the email message in a web browser, you can easily edit the content using the browser’s built-in editing tools. You can also select and copy the content to a new document or text editor if you prefer.\nIf you need to convert the email file to a different format, you can use a web-based or desktop email converter tool, which can convert the HTML or text content of the email file to a different format such as PDF, DOCX, or TXT.\nConclusion Editing and converting email files can be a challenging task. However, with this simple trick, you can unlock the secrets to editing and converting email files quickly and easily.\nBy opening the email file in a web browser, you can edit the content using the browser’s built-in editing tools and convert the email file to a different format using an email converter tool.\nSo, the next time you need to edit or convert an email file, remember this simple trick and make the process a breeze.\nThis article explains how to open and convert an Outlook Express EMAIL file so that you can read the message’s contents in a modern email program.\nWhat to Know\nOpen with Outlook Express, or rename it as an EML file and open it in another program or online file viewer.After renaming the file, try an online file converter tool like Zamzar to convert and read in another program.Also try opening the file in a text editor and saving it to a different file format. EMAIL files are rarely seen. How to Open an EMAIL File EMAIL files can be opened by Windows Live Mail, part of the old, free Windows Essentials suite. An older version of this program, Outlook Express, will also open EMAIL files. Outlook Express Email was discontinued in 2006. We recommend using Outlook.com, an email service with free options.\nIf you’re having trouble opening the file, try renaming it to use the EML file extension instead. Most modern email programs only recognize email files that end with that extension, even though they might support EMAIL files, too. Changing the file’s suffix to EML should let the program open it.\nThis Windows Essential suite has been discontinued by Microsoft but can still be found in some places. Digiex is one example of a website where you can download Windows Essentials 2012.\nAnother way you might be able to open an EMAIL file is with an online file viewer like the one at encryptomatic. However, it only supports EML and MSG files, so you should first rename the file as described above and then upload that file.\nYou can open an EMAIL file without Outlook Express or Windows Live Mail by using a free text editor. This method lets you view the file as a text document, which is helpful if the majority of the email is saved in plain text, and you don’t need access to the file attachment(s).\nRenaming a file’s extension like this doesn’t actually convert it to a different format. If renaming works, it’s because the program or website can recognize both formats but only lets you open the file if it’s using a specific file extension (EML in this case).\nHow to Convert an EMAIL File We haven’t tried it ourselves, but you might be able to convert an EMAIL file with Zamzar. However, just like the other tools mentioned earlier, this one doesn’t support this old EMAIL format; rename it to *.EML first. Zamzar can convert that email format to DOC, HTML, PDF, JPG, TXT, and others.\nIt’s also possible that the programs above can convert the EMAIL file to a different format, but it’s likely that they only support EML and HTML.\nStill Can’t Open It? If your file doesn’t open properly, remember that a file with the EMAIL file extension is not just any generic “email file” that you get when downloading emails to your computer through any messaging program. Although “email file” and “EMAIL file” appear to mean the same thing, not all email files are EMAIL files.\nMost email files (i.e., files you download through an email client) are not EMAIL files because that format is used only in older Microsoft email clients that most people don’t use anymore. Modern email clients store the same information in a different format, usually EML/EMLX or MSG.\nSomething else to consider is that you might not have an email-related file at all. Some extensions, like MAL, could be confused for EMAIL even though the formats are completely different. MAL files are configuration files used by MadAppLauncher.\nWhat Is an EMAIL File? A file with the EMAIL file extension is an Outlook Express Email Message file. It includes not only the message of the email but also any file attachments that were included when the email was received by Outlook Express.\nIt’s possible that a .EMAIL file is associated with an old AOL mail program, too.\nEMAIL files are rarely seen these days because newer email clients use other file formats to store messages in, like EML/EMLX or MSG.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1193","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-12T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-12T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jewell Gipson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-open-edit-and-convert-email-files868579/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock the Secrets to Editing and Converting Email Files with This Simple Trick!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 12, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1193 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jewell Gipson</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#understanding-email-files>Understanding Email Files</a></li><li><a href=#the-problem-with-editing-and-converting-email-files>The Problem with Editing and Converting Email Files</a></li><li><a href=#the-simple-trick>The Simple Trick</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a><ul><li><a href=#heading></a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#how-to-open-an-email-file>How to Open an EMAIL File</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-convert-an-email-file>How to Convert an EMAIL File</a></li><li><a href=#still-cant-open-it>Still Can&rsquo;t Open It?</a></li><li><a href=#what-is-an-email-file>What Is an EMAIL File?</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=unlock-the-secrets-to-editing-and-converting-email-files-with-this-simple-trick>Unlock the Secrets to Editing and Converting Email Files with This Simple Trick!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#unlock-the-secrets-to-editing-and-converting-email-files-with-this-simple-trick>#</a></h1><p>Have you ever encountered a situation where you need to edit or convert an email file, but you have no idea how to do it?
