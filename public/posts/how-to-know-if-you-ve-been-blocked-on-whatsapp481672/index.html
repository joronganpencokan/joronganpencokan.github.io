It’s a great way to keep in touch with friends and family, but sometimes things go wrong. Have you ever felt like someone has blocked you on WhatsApp, but you’re not sure? It’s a frustrating feeling, but thankfully there are ways to find out if you’ve been blocked.\nFirstly, pay attention to the person’s profile picture. If their picture doesn’t appear, you may have been blocked. However, this isn’t a foolproof method because the person may have simply changed their profile picture or deleted WhatsApp.\nAnother thing to look out for is the message indicators. If you’ve been blocked, you won’t be able to see the person’s ‘last seen’ information or online status. Additionally, any messages you send will only appear with one tick (indicating it has been sent) and not the second tick (which indicates the message has been delivered).\nIf you’re still unsure, try calling the person. If you’ve been blocked, the call will not go through, and you will receive a message saying that the person is unavailable.\nBut the most effective way to find out if you’ve been blocked is by creating a group conversation with the person who you suspect has blocked you. If you can’t see the person’s name in the group member list, you’ve been blocked.\nIf you’ve been blocked, unfortunately, there’s nothing you can do about it. You won’t be able to contact the person through WhatsApp, and you’ll never know why they decided to block you. However, it’s important not to let being blocked get you down. There are plenty of people in the world who will appreciate you and want to stay in contact with you.\nIn conclusion, getting blocked on WhatsApp can be an unpleasant experience, but there are signs you can look out for to verify if you’ve been blocked. If you have been blocked, it’s important to move on and focus on the positive relationships in your life.\nThis article explains how to tell if a user has blocked you on WhatsApp. Not all of these methods will tell you definitively if you’ve been blocked but can give you hints. These steps apply to all versions on all devices; some of these steps are also relevant to WhatsApp Web.\nWhat to Know\nCheck the user’s Last Seen status. See if there are two checkmarks on your message. Try to add the user to a group chat. If you can’t add them to a group chat, don’t see their status, or there’s only one checkmark, the user might have blocked you.Try calling the user. The call won’t go through if they’ve blocked you. Check Your Contact’s Last Seen Status Here’s how to check the user’s Last Seen status. Last Seen status refers to the last time the contact used WhatsApp.\nFind and open a chat with the user. If a conversation isn’t open, find the user’s name and create a new chat. The Last Seen status is visible under the user’s name—for example, “last seen today at 10:18 A.M.” If you don’t see anything under the user’s name, it’s possible they blocked you. A lack of a Last Seen status isn’t necessarily an indication that you’ve been blocked. WhatsApp has a privacy setting that allows the user to hide their Last Seen status. Check the Checkmarks Messages sent to a contact who blocked you always show one checkmark (indicating that the message was sent), and never show a second checkmark (confirming that a message was delivered).\nFind and open a chat with the user.\nIf a conversation isn’t open, find the user’s name and create a new chat.\nThe Last Seen status is visible under the user’s name—for example, “last seen today at 10:18 A.M.”\nIf you don’t see anything under the user’s name, it’s possible they blocked you.\nA lack of a Last Seen status isn’t necessarily an indication that you’ve been blocked. WhatsApp has a privacy setting that allows the user to hide their Last Seen status.\nOn its own, this could mean the user lost their phone or can’t connect to the internet. Combined with a lack of a Last Seen status, however, the evidence is piling up that you’ve been blocked.\nLook for Updates to Their Profile When someone blocks you on WhatsApp, you won’t see updates to their profile photo. On its own, this isn’t a definitive clue, given that many users don’t have profile pictures or rarely update theirs. Combined with a lack of a Last Seen status and undelivered messages, though, it’s another indication you’ve been blocked.\nTry Calling Them Using WhatsApp If you’re blocked, a call to the user might not connect or might result in an “unsuccessful call” message.\nCheck the Participants List in a Group Message When creating a group message in WhatsApp, it may seem as if you successfully added the user—but when you open the group chat, they don’t appear in the participants list. If you try to add a contact who’s blocked you through the Add Participants section of the group chat, you’ll get a Can’t add participant error.\nWhatsApp is intentionally ambiguous about blocked status to protect the blocker’s privacy, and it will not notify you if you’ve been blocked. If you see all the indicators above, your WhatsApp contact likely blocked you. If you’ve been blocked, there’s no way to unblock yourself. Your best course of action is to either move on or reach out to the person to find out why you were blocked.\nHow do I block a WhatsApp contact?
