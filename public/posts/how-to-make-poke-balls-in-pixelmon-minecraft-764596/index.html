The popular mod allows you to catch and battle your favorite Pokemon in your Minecraft world. But before you can start your journey to become the best Pokemon trainers, you need to create Poke Balls. Here’s how you can do it.\nFirst, you need to gather the necessary materials. You need Apricorns, which are found in the wild, and Iron Ingots. Apricorns come in different colors, but you need to find and pick up the red, blue, yellow, green, and black Apricorns to create the different types of Poke Balls.\nOnce you have the materials, you need to craft them. Start by placing the Apricorn in the crafting table. Each Apricorn creates a specific type of Poke Ball, depending on its color. Green Apricorns make Friend Balls, while Black Apricorns make Timer Balls. Here are the other Apricorn colors and their corresponding Poke Balls:\nRed Apricorns make Level Balls Blue Apricorns make Lure Balls Yellow Apricorns make Moon Balls After putting the Apricorn, you need to add an Iron Base to the crafting table. An Iron Base is made from an Iron Ingot in the center surrounded by eight Cobblestones around it. Once you have the Iron Base, place the Apricorn on top to create the Poke Ball.\nCongratulations! You have crafted your first Poke Ball. You can use it to catch and store Pokemon in your inventory, which you can use for battles and trades.\nBut crafting Poke Balls isn’t just about making them. You need to understand their types and how they work. Here are some of the Poke Ball types and their effects:\nLevel Ball: The higher your Pokemon’s level compared to the wild Pokemon, the more effective it is. Lure Ball: This ball is more effective when fishing for water Pokemon. Friend Ball: Pokemon caught in this ball become more friendly towards the trainer. Timer Ball: The longer the battle goes, the more effective it becomes. Moon Ball: This ball is more effective when catching Pokemon that evolve by Moon Stone. Now that you know how to craft Poke Balls and their different types, you’re ready to become a master trainer in Pixelmon Minecraft. Explore the world, catch more Pokemon, and build your team to take on other trainers.
