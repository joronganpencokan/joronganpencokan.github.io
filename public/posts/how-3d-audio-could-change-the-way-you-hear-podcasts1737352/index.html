A poorly produced show with bad sound is frustrating, to say the least. That’s why you should be excited about the new technology that’s revolutionizing the podcasting world: 3D audio.\nWhat is 3D Audio? Before diving into the benefits of 3D audio, let’s take a brief look at what it is. In simple terms, 3D audio (also known as spatial audio) is a way to create sound that mimics how we hear in the real world. By using advanced technology and algorithms, 3D audio creates a surround sound effect that feels like you’re in the same room as the hosts or guests of your podcast.\nBenefits of 3D Audio for Podcasts So, what makes 3D audio such a game-changer for podcasting? Here are some benefits:\nImmersive Experience: With 3D audio, you feel like you’re a part of the conversation. You can hear each participant’s voice as if they’re physically around you, making it perfect for interview-based podcasts, where the quality of the conversation is key.\nBetter Storytelling: Most people can easily picture scenes from books and movies in their heads. With 3D audio, you don’t need to rely only on words to create a scene. The effect of sound coming from different directions allows podcasters to create an immersive experience that listeners can visualize more easily.\nIncreased Listener Retention: If your show sounds great and your audience can easily imagine the scenes you’re describing, they’re more likely to stay engaged and invested in your show. This means they’re likely to listen to future episodes and even share your show with their friends.\nWhere to Find 3D Audio Podcasts 3D audio is still a relatively new technology, but more and more podcasts are starting to experiment with it. Here are some examples:\nNPR’s Tiny Desk: You can listen to a 3D audio version of NPR’s Tiny Desk concerts on the NPR Music website. They’ve already published a handful of episodes, featuring artists like Coldplay and Billie Eilish.\nThe Daily 360: The New York Times’ podcast, The Daily, recently experimented with 3D audio by creating an episode called The Daily 360. In this episode, they used 3D audio to take listeners on a journey through a ritual ceremony in Myanmar.\nMELT: The London-based podcast network, Resonance FM, has experimented with 3D audio on several of their shows. One such show is MELT, which uses 3D audio to create an immersive experience that feels like you’re moving through different layers of sound.\nFinal Thoughts As 3D audio becomes a more popular technology in the podcasting industry, we can expect to see more shows experiment with it. With its immersive experience and better storytelling capabilities, 3D audio has the potential to take your favorite podcasts to the next level. Give it a listen and see what all the fuss is about!\nPodcasts could start to sound a lot more realistic now that streaming companies are getting into 3D audio.\nKey Takeaways\nPodcasts could benefit from the addition of 3D sound technology designed to make them sound more realistic. iHeart Media announced recently that it’s investing in binaural audio, also known as 3D audio. Binaural audio creates a sense of movement and location. iHeart Media announced recently that it’s investing in binaural audio, also known as 3D audio. The technology is intended to make listeners feel like they are in the same room as a recording. The advance of 3D audio could herald a revolution in podcasts, experts say. “In a typical podcast, it’s kind of just a person talking,” John Merchant, chair of the Department of Recording Industry at Middle Tennessee State University, said in a phone interview.\n“With 3D audio, you can imagine how much more interesting it would be when instead of people talking to you, you are suddenly in the scene.” Making Sound More Realistic Binaural audio creates a sense of movement and location. With in-person entertainment on hold during the coronavirus pandemic, podcasting is booming. Listenership is expected to grow by 30 million listeners each year through 2023.\niHeartMedia said that it would launch a new slate of podcasts using 3D recording technology. Building on the success of its previously launched binaural audio series 13 Days of Halloween, the company plans to expand the concept with a seasonally focused 13 Days franchise of podcasts correlating with various major holidays, among other shows. “Podcasting has undoubtedly stepped in as one of this year’s most relied upon forms of entertainment,” Conal Byrne, president of the iHeartPodcast Network, said in a news release.\n“We’ve seen a huge spike in listenership, and iHeart wants to ensure we’re meeting this growing audience in new, innovative ways. This is virtual reality for the ears, and by expanding our 3D audio offerings, our goal is to place fans at the center of the stories they love—in an even more immersive, innovative format.”\nThe company said it plans to produce around a dozen 3D audio podcasts this year. It also plans to host live binaural radio events across its network of stations. iHeartMedia has built three studios in which it can record 3D audio, The Verge reports. Horror Shows Sound Creepier in 3D Podcast writer and producer Aaron Mahnke said that 3D audio will enhance the listening experience. He worked on 13 Days of Halloween, a podcast intended to make listeners feel like they were inside a purgatorial hotel. “I remember when we were in production for the series and thinking I’d never seen anything like the recording process for a 3D listening experience—even the mic and equipment setup look very different,” said Mahnke in a news release. The 3D audio technology used by iHeart offers distinct advantages over the regular audio listeners are used to, Merchant said. It’s a more natural sound, for one thing. “We hear things in 360, and it’s how we perceive the world,” he added.\n“It’s important to us that we can hear things and localize them all around us. Now, part of that evolved from a survival standpoint. So that if you hear a twig snap behind you, and it was a puma, you knew which direction to run away from the puma.” Podcasting has undoubtedly stepped in as one of this year’s most relied upon forms of entertainment.\n“The PS5 console can put you at the center of incredibly immersive soundscapes where it feels as if the sound comes from every direction,” according to the company’s website. But regular headphones or earbuds also will allow you to hear 3D audio, Merchant said. Headphones marketed for 3D sound are “a total gimmick,” he said. Merchant said that while iHeart’s podcasts are the only ones currently using 3D audio, he thinks the technology has a bright future. “I think they are on to something,” he added. “It’s the perfect medium. I believe that it’s going to be one of those things that once you hear it, you will be like, ‘Oh, this is way better.’”\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1191","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-30T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Douglas Markowitz"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-3d-audio-could-change-the-way-you-hear-podcasts1737352/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionary 3D Audio: Hear Your Favorite Podcasts Like Never Before!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 30, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1191 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Douglas Markowitz</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#heading></a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#making-sound-more-realistic>Making Sound More Realistic</a></li><li><a href=#horror-shows-sound-creepier-in-3d>Horror Shows Sound Creepier in 3D</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Revolutionary 3D Audio: Hear Your Favorite Podcasts Like Never Before!</p><p>If you&rsquo;re a podcast listener, then you know that sound quality is paramount when it comes to enhancing your listening experience.
