If you’re a fan of the hack-and-slash genre, you’ll absolutely love Hades. This action-packed game, developed by Supergiant Games, presents a unique twist on the Greek mythos while also being one of the most challenging action games you’ll ever play. One of the elements that makes Hades so exciting is the concept of companions. Companions are powerful beings that can aid you on your journey through the underworld. However, you can’t access all of them from the get-go.\nIn this article, we’ll show you how to unlock some of the most impressive companions in Hades by using the power of darkness. The darkness is one of the in-game resources that you’ll gather along your journey, and it’s essential to help you unlock the potential of your companions.\nThe Importance of Companions In Hades, you play as Zagreus, the son of Hades, who’s on a mission to escape the underworld. Along your challenging journey, you’ll fight many foes who are trying to bring you down. That’s where companions come in. In Hades, they’re called “boons” and are powerful enhancements that can increase your damage, provide you with extra abilities to help you defeat enemies, and give you a considerable advantage.\nCompanions in Hades To activate companions, you must first acquire them. You can use darkness, the in-game resource, to unlock new companions. There are various companions in Hades, including gods, goddesses, and mythical creatures. Here are some of the most powerful companions:\nSisyphus To unlock Sisyphus, you’ll need to earn yourself a hefty sum of darkness, and then find him idle and waiting during your escape attempts. He’ll give you an item that will increase your health, so that you can stay in the game for longer.\nMegaera Megaera, one of the three furies, is a formidable foe that you must defeat as a boss. After you defeat her, you can use 500 darkness to unlock her, and she will spawn mini-furies that can attack nearby enemies.\nPatroclus To unlock Patroclus, you need to defeat Theseus in a boss battle, then use 1000 darkness at the House of Hades bar after his dialogue unlocks. Patroclus is a fierce fighter with a powerful sweeping attack.\nThanatos Thanatos, the god of death, is one of the most powerful companions in Hades. To unlock him, you must use 15 keys to unlock a contract at the House of Hades bulletin board, then meet him during your escape attempts. Once you unlock him, he’ll help you take down enemies and give you an extra life.\nConclusion Companions are an essential element of Hades, and they can either make or break your success in the game. With the right companions, you can overpower your enemies, and with the wrong ones, you can find yourself struggling to stay alive. However, unlocking companions can be time-consuming and require strategy. That’s where the darkness comes in. Use this in-game resource wisely and unlock some of the most formidable companions in all of Hades.\nHades is finally out to be played in PC and Nintendo Switch. Along with several other elements in the game, Hades allows players to unlock companions. These companions can help players during an intense battle. The game contains a total of 6 companions that can be unlocked. If you don’t know how to unlock companions and use them in Hades, you are in the right place. This guide will walk you through how to unlock and get companions in Hades.\nHow to Equip Companions in Hades Companions, also known as legendary keepsakes, are items that can be unlocked with the help of Nectar. When you give six Nectars to specific NPCs, they reward you with a companion.\nYou can equip the companions from the display case in the courtyard. While on a run, you cannot equip companions to use them as and when you want.\nList of all the Companions and Whom to Give Nectar to Unlock Them Antos You need to give Nectar to Achilles to unlock Antos. Antos companion deals damage of 1500 to two nearby foes. You cannot use it in the boss battles. It can only be used at most five times per run at max rank.\nBattie You need to give Nectar to Megaera to unlock Battie. Battie companion deals damage of 2500 to everyone who is in front of you. You cannot use it in the boss battle and not on Fury sisters. It can only be used at most five times per run at max rank.\nFidi You need to give Nectar to Dusa to unlock Fidi. Fidi companion deals damage of 70 per each shot that it unleashes for 15 seconds. It can only be used at most five times per run at max rank.\nMort You need to give Nectar to Thanatos to unlock Mort. Mort companion deals damage of 3500 in front of you. You cannot use it during the Thanatos encounter or during boss battles. It can only be used at most five times per run at max rank.\nRib You need to give Nectar to Skelly to unlock Rib. Rib companion distracts enemies in the area. This prevents them from attacking you for a short period of time. You cannot use this to defeat the Charon boss. It can only be used at most five times per run at max rank.\nShady You need to give Nectar to Sisyphus to unlock Shady. Shady companion deals damage of 1000 in nearby area and drops some items. These dropped items include health, darkness, and gold. You can use this on anyone and at any time without any restrictions.
