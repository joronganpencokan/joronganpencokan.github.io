If you’re struggling to come up with ideas, using someone else’s words can be a quick fix. However, it’s crucial to give credit where credit is due and not plagiarize or steal someone else’s intellectual property.\nHow to Copy Captions Copying captions is easy on Instagram.

Now, you have the link to the post, and you can copy the caption from there.\nWhen copying captions, pay attention to the formatting, hashtags, and emojis used.

Also, make sure to give credit to the original author by tagging them or mentioning their username in your post.\nHow to Copy Comments Copying comments is a bit trickier since Instagram doesn’t have a built-in feature for it. However, you can use a third-party app like Repost for Instagram to copy comments. Simply install the app, find the post with the comment you want to copy, and tap on the three dots. Select “Share to Repost” and choose the option to copy the caption or comment.\nAgain, be mindful of giving credit to the original author and avoid plagiarism.
