Here is how you can mirror your Android screen using TeamViewer.\nMirror Android Screen to Windows Using TeamViewer To start, you need to install the free TeamViewer QuickSupport app on your Android device and the TeamViewer application on your Windows machine. The good thing about this approach is that your Android device doesn’t have to be rooted.\nAfter installing, the first thing you need to do is get your unique TeamViewer ID from your Android device. To do that, open the TeamViewer QuickSupport app on your Android mobile. On the home screen, you will see your unique ID.\nNow, open the TeamViewer application installed on your PC by searching for it in the Start menu.\nOnce the application has been opened on your Windows system, enter the unique ID displayed on your Android device and click on the “Connect to Partner” button.\nAs soon as you click on the button, you will see an alert message asking for your permission on your Android screen. Simply tap on the option “Allow” to continue.\nYou will see another message on your Android screen; click on the “Start Now” button to continue.\nOnce you allow the access, you will see your Android screen mirroring on your Windows PC inside the TeamViewer window. One thing you need to keep in mind is that the TeamViewer app on Android is only capable of mirroring; you cannot interact with the screen.\nAs I said before, you can also transfer files using the TeamViewer. To do that, click on the “File Transfer” option appearing in the upper-left corner.\nThis action will open the File Transfer window. The left side of the window is your system drives/files/folders and the right side is your Android device’s files and folders. To transfer a file, select the file on your system, select the destination on your Android device and click on the “Send” button.\nThis will initiate the file transfer. Depending on your Internet connection speed or the local network speed, the file will be transferred in a couple of minutes.\nBy default, TeamViewer optimizes the screen mirroring for better speeds, which is quite helpful if you using your normal Internet connection. But if you are not a local network then you can optimize the screen mirroring for better quality. To do that, click on the full-screen icon appearing in the TeamViewer window.\nNow, click on the “View” tab and then select the option “Optimize quality.” In just a few seconds you will see the sharp screen mirroring on your Windows device.\nIf you want to you can also record the screen. To do that, select the tab “Files and Extras” and select the option “Start Session Recording.”\nOnce you are done with everything, you can close the connection from your Android device by clicking on the “Close” button and then selecting the option “Close” from the confirmation window.\nConclusion As you can see, TeamViewer is a good app that lets you easily mirror your Android screen to a Windows PC, and it even lets you transfer files and folders to and from. There are a lot more features like the ability to uninstall apps, monitor CPU, memory and battery usage, know device info, etc. So, if you ever need to mirror your Android screen to your Windows PC, do give the app try.\nDo comment below sharing your thoughts and experiences about using TeamViewer to mirror an Android screen to a Windows PC.\nVamsi is a tech and WordPress geek who enjoys writing how-to guides and messing with his computer and software in general.
