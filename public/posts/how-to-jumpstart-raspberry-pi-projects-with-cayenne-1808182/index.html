So next time you start a new Raspberry Pi project, consider using Docker to take your project to the next level!\nIf you’ve amassed a collection of smart devices, sensors, actuators and various other Internet-connected gadgets, how do you turn your Internet-connected components into an Internet of things (IoT) project?\nCayenne is a mobile app, online service and dashboard that aims to make the world of IoT more accessible. Once you have Cayenne installed on your Raspberry Pi, you’ll be able to build IoT projects simply by navigating various menus and selecting different buttons.\nFor newcomers, Cayenne takes a lot of the complexity out of creating IoT and home automation networks, while more experienced users will be able to use Cayenne to jumpstart their projects – cutting through all of that boring setup and boilerplate code, to get straight to the good stuff.\nYou’ll learn how to get Cayenne up and running on your Raspberry Pi, register all of your sensors, actuators and devices, and then create a simple temperature-based trigger in this article.\nWhat is Cayenne? Cayenne consists of the following components:\nSoftware that runs on your Raspberry Pi and is responsible for managing commands, triggers and alerts. You can install this software using the Cayenne mobile app or by running Terminal commands directly on your Raspberry Pi. Both methods are covered in this tutorial.The Cayenne cloud, which processes and stores all of the data from your Raspberry Pi.An online dashboard, which provides a graphical environment where you can build your IoT projects and manage all of the components you’ve registered with Cayenne. What you’ll need To complete this tutorial, you’ll need:\nRaspberry Pi 4SD cardLaptop or computer where you’ll download the Raspbian system imagePower cable that’s compatible with your model of Raspberry PiEthernet cable if not connecting over Wi-Fi Depending on the method you use to install Cayenne, you may also need:\nExternal keyboard and way to attach it to your Raspberry PiMicro HDMI cableExternal monitorSmartphone or tablet using Android or iOS Once you have your tools, you’re ready to set up Cayenne.\nInstall the Raspbian operating system To install the Raspbian operating system:\nDownload the latest version of Raspbian to your laptop or computer.\nInsert the SD card into your computer or laptop.\nDownload and install Etcher if you haven’t already.\nIn Etcher, click “Select image” and choose the Raspbian file you just downloaded.\nClick “Select target” and choose your SD card.\nEtcher will now flash Raspbian to your SD card. Remove the SD card from your laptop or computer and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.\nThe next steps will vary, depending on whether you’re installing Cayenne using the mobile app or running Terminal commands directly on your Raspberry Pi.\nMethod 1: Using the Cayenne mobile app Install Cayenne on your Raspberry Pi using the Cayenne mobile app:\nAttach your ethernet cable to the Raspberry Pi.\nPlug your Raspberry Pi into a power source. The device should boot automatically.\nDownload Cayenne to your mobile device.\nInstall and launch the app.\nTap “Open -\u003e Create my free Account,” and register with Cayenne.\nLog into your new Cayenne account.\nTap the “Find Raspberry Pis” button to locate your Raspberry Pi.\nWhen your Raspberry Pi appears, give it a tap.\nCayenne will install the libraries and agents to your Raspberry Pi, reboot your Raspberry Pi, and finally install the software and drivers. This may take a few minutes, so it’s the perfect time to go grab a coffee!\nOnce all the necessary software has been installed, your Raspberry Pi will appear in the Cayenne dashboard.\nMethod 2: Running Terminal commands Alternatively, if you don’t want to use the mobile app, install Cayenne on your Raspberry Pi using Terminal commands:\nAttach your external monitor, keyboard and optional ethernet cable to your Raspberry Pi.\nAttach a power cable, and your Raspberry Pi should boot automatically.\nComplete the usual configuration, including connecting to Wi-Fi if you’re not using an ethernet cable.\nHead over to the Cayenne website and create your free account.\nOnce you’re signed into your account, select “Add New -\u003e Device / Widget.”\nSelect “Raspberry Pi.” The Cayenne console will generate an installer script you can use to download all of the necessary software to your Raspberry Pi.\nOn your Raspberry Pi, open a Terminal window by clicking the Terminal icon in the toolbar.\nType the Cayenne installation script into the Terminal and press the Enter key on your keyboard. Raspbian will now download all the necessary software to your Raspberry Pi.\nAfter installation, your Raspberry Pi will reboot automatically. Following a successful reboot, your Raspberry Pi will appear in the Cayenne dashboard.\nTroubleshooting: Cayenne can’t find my Raspberry Pi! If Cayenne is struggling to locate your Raspberry Pi, then:\n1. Check your network Cayenne can only detect a Raspberry Pi that’s connected to the same network. Regardless of whether you’re using Cayenne for Android, iOS or via the web browser, check that you’re on the same network as your Raspberry Pi.\n2. Search based on IP address Whenever you scan for a device, you should see an option to “Search with an IP address.”\nIf Cayenne is struggling to locate your Raspberry Pi, then you may get positive results by clicking this link and entering your Raspberry Pi’s IP address.\nYou can retrieve this IP address by launching the Raspbian Terminal and running the following command:\nMonitoring your Raspberry Pi with Cayenne Use the Cayenne dashboard to view some stats about your Raspberry Pi, including its CPU, RAM and temperature.\nAny of these statistics can be tapped as well to view the data that Cayenne has logged over time, which can help you identify trends in your device’s health and performance.\nBuilding your IoT network: adding sensors and actuators If you have any sensors or actuators on your network, you can add these components to Cayenne, at which point you’ll be able to monitor and interact with these components from the Cayenne dashboard. Note that the following steps are via the mobile app, so the user interface may be slightly different if you’re accessing the dashboard via the web browser.\nIn the Cayenne app, select your Raspberry Pi device.\nSelect the little speedometer icon in the toolbar.\nTap the little “+’ icon in the upper-right corner.\nFind the sensor or actuator that you want to add and give it a tap.\nComplete the subsequent form, and then tap either “Add sensor” or “Add actuator.”\nYou can now work with this component.\nCreate a temperature trigger There are many different tasks you can perform from the Cayenne dashboard, but we’re creating a simple temperature trigger. In this workflow, Cayenne will generate a notification whenever this component exceeds a certain temperature threshold , which can be useful for ensuring components don’t overheat or for triggering broader home automation workflows, such as switching your heating on and off.\nIn the Cayenne app:\nSelect the Raspberry Pi device you want to work with.\nTap the little “Play” button in the toolbar, then tap the “+” icon in the upper-right corner.\nGive this trigger a name, such as “Too hot” used here.\nTap the blue “+” button.\nFind the sensor or actuator that you want to monitor and tap its accompanying “Temperature” button.\nSelect a temperature threshold.\nMake sure “Sensor above” is selected.\nTap “then -\u003e +”\nChoose how you want to receive your notification, over email or SMS. Enter the necessary information and then tap “Done.”\nWhen you’re happy with the information you’ve entered, tap the “Save” icon in the upper-right corner.\nTo activate your trigger, make sure the “Play” button is selected and push the slider into the “On” position.\nYou’ll now receive a notification every time this component exceeds the specified temperature threshold.\nNow that you’ve set up Cayenne and familiarized yourself with the essential Cayenne workflow, you can continue adding devices, sensors and actuators, and use Cayenne to create triggers and rules for all of your IoT components, or better still, turn your Raspberry Pi into a edge gateway.\nJessica Thornsby is a technical writer based in Derbyshire, UK.

Note that the following steps are via the mobile app, so the user interface may be slightly different if you’re accessing the dashboard via the web browser.</p><ol><li><p>In the Cayenne app, select your Raspberry Pi device.</p></li><li><p>Select the little speedometer icon in the toolbar.</p></li><li><p>Tap the little “+’ icon in the upper-right corner.</p></li><li><p>Find the sensor or actuator that you want to add and give it a tap.</p></li><li><p>Complete the subsequent form, and then tap either “Add sensor” or “Add actuator.”</p></li></ol><p>You can now work with this component.</p><h3 id=create-a-temperature-trigger>Create a temperature trigger<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#create-a-temperature-trigger>#</a></h3><p>There are many different tasks you can perform from the Cayenne dashboard, but we’re creating a simple temperature trigger. In this workflow, Cayenne will generate a notification whenever this component exceeds a certain temperature threshold , which can be useful for ensuring components don’t overheat or for triggering broader home automation workflows, such as switching your heating on and off.</p><p>In the Cayenne app:</p><ol><li><p>Select the Raspberry Pi device you want to work with.</p></li><li><p>Tap the little “Play” button in the toolbar, then tap the “+” icon in the upper-right corner.</p></li><li><p>Give this trigger a name, such as “Too hot” used here.</p></li><li><p>Tap the blue “+” button.</p></li><li><p>Find the sensor or actuator that you want to monitor and tap its accompanying “Temperature” button.</p></li><li><p>Select a temperature threshold.</p></li><li><p>Make sure “Sensor above” is selected.</p></li><li><p>Tap “then -> +”</p></li><li><p>Choose how you want to receive your notification, over email or SMS. Enter the necessary information and then tap “Done.”</p></li><li><p>When you’re happy with the information you’ve entered, tap the “Save” icon in the upper-right corner.</p></li><li><p>To activate your trigger, make sure the “Play” button is selected and push the slider into the “On” position.</p></li></ol><p>You’ll now receive a notification every time this component exceeds the specified temperature threshold.</p><p>Now that you’ve set up Cayenne and familiarized yourself with the essential Cayenne workflow, you can continue adding devices, sensors and actuators, and use Cayenne to create triggers and rules for all of your IoT components, or better still, turn your Raspberry Pi into a edge gateway.</p><p>Jessica Thornsby is a technical writer based in Derbyshire, UK.
