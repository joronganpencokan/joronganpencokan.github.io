It can be frustrating when your Mac’s speed slows down, and it takes longer to boot up or launch applications. This sluggishness can be caused by several factors, one of the most common being a cluttered system.\nThe solution to streamlining your Mac’s performance is not to buy a new device but to tweak the machine to run more streamlined. One of the most potent ways to do this is by modifying your Mac’s Path variable. This simple hack can speed up your Mac, reduce CPU usage, and optimize your workflow.\nWhat is the Path variable?\nThe Path variable is a file that tells your Mac where to find executable files when you run a command. It is a list of directories that the Mac looks in for programs, scripts, and other executables. If a directory is listed in your Path variable, the Mac will be able to find and run programs from that folder.\nWhy Modify the Path variable?\nBy default, the Path variable contains all the directories that Apple considers important, such as /usr/bin and /bin/. However, over time, as you install more applications, the directories listed in the Path variable will likely increase. It becomes cluttered, making it hard for the Mac to search in various directories, leading to slower performance. When every action, including running a command, takes up more time, it is natural to want to optimize your device and reduce the time it takes to complete tasks. By streamlining your Mac’s Path variable, you can achieve this.\nHow to Modify the Path variable?\nModifying the Path variable is not as challenging as it sounds. Follow these simple steps to streamline your Mac:\nStep 1: Open the Terminal application on your Mac.\nStep 2: Type nano ~./bash_profile, and press enter. This command will open up a file.\nStep 3: Scroll down to the bottom of the file and type export PATH=“/new/directory/location:$PATH”, replacing “/new/directory/location” with the specific directory you want to add.\nStep 4: Press Control+X to save and exit nano.\nStep 5: Close the Terminal and restart your Mac for the changes to reflect.\nThis hack will allow your Mac to skip searching through directories it doesn’t need to check when running a command. By reducing the computer’s workload, you can increase its speed and efficiency. You can also remove any directories if you don’t use them frequently.\nConclusion\nModifying the Path variable is a simple but powerful way to optimize your Mac’s performance. It can streamline your computer’s processes by making it easier for your device to locate and run requested programs. By reducing the clutter in your Path variable, you can experience the benefits of increased efficiency and productivity straight away. Unlock the secret to streamlining your Mac’s performance with this genius Path variable hack, and see the magic of a streamlined computer.\nIn Summary\nModifying or setting the PATH environment variable on Mac isn’t easy if you don’t have prior experience. Doing so can sometimes accidentally mess up your Mac’s existing PATH environment configuration and render the terminal nearly useless, preventing you from Mac terminal commands and programs. Fixing a bad PATH on Mac requires you to reset the PATH environment variable to the default macOS PATH entries. And the guide below demonstrates the steps involved in this process.\nHowever, while you’re at it, there are times when you accidentally mess up the existing (read default) PATH environment configuration on your system. On Windows, this isn’t a problem since it takes only one step to restore the default state of the PATH variable. But if you’re on Mac, this isn’t as straightforward. And so, to simplify this equation, here’s a guide detailing the steps required to reset the PATH variable to its default state.\nWhen Would You Want to Reset the PATH Variable in macOS? To give you a brief idea of the need to reset the PATH variable, consider a scenario where you accidentally mess up—delete or update—the existing PATH environment variable on your Mac with incorrect program paths. When this happens, all your existing terminal commands, including the basic commands such as ls, cd, where, mkdir, rmdir, etc., stop working and throw the command not found error. As a result, it renders the terminal nearly useless, keeping you from performing various system operations.\nHow to Reset the PATH Variable in macOS Resetting the PATH variable in macOS involves editing either the shell config file or shell profile file and adding the default paths to it. Just like most operations on macOS, this can be done in two ways: GUI and CLI.\nResetting macOS PATH Variable via CLI Since setting the PATH for a program or shell script on macOS requires interacting with the terminal; you’ve likely messed up your PATH somewhere along the way. And hence, the obvious approach to reset it is via the terminal itself. But as you’d guess, this isn’t possible right away because a messed-up PATH means you can’t use any terminal command. So to overcome this, we first need to set the PATH temporarily such that we can use the terminal to navigate directories and edit the PATH configuration file, which is required to reset the PATH variable. Enter the following command in the terminal and hit Return to set the PATH temporarily: export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin Next, open either the config file or the profile file for your shell. If you’re on older versions of macOS (before Catalina), the default shell on your system is bash, in which case you can open either the .bashrc or the .bash_profile file. On newer versions of macOS (Catalina or above), you’d have zsh (or z shell) as the default shell—unless you’ve changed it to bash. And so, you must edit either the .zhrc or the .zsh_profile file. Now, depending on the shell you’re using, run any one of the following commands: For bash nano ~/.bash_profile or nano ~/.bashrc For zsh nano ~/.zsh_profile or nano ~/.zshrc Once inside any of these files, you need to add all the default paths to the PATH environment variable using the command below: export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\nHit Control + O to write your changes. When prompted to confirm the file name, hit Return. Press Control + X to exit the editor. Close the active terminal window and reopen it to start a new session. Alternatively, you can run the command below to apply the changes immediately: source ~/.bashrc or source ~/.bash_profile Replace .bashrc or .bash_profile with .zshrc or .zsh_profile if your system’s default shell is zsh. Finally, verify if the PATH has been set—and reset to the default PATH settings—correctly by running: echo $PATH\nIf the shell returns a list of all the different paths, that means your PATH environment variable has been reset, and so, you can resume using various macOS terminal commands on it as you did before.\nResetting macOS PATH Variable via GUI In case you aren’t comfortable working with the CLI or find the whole process a bit tedious, you can use the GUI approach, which is rather straightforward. For this, open the Finder and go to the root directory \u003e Users \u003e your_user_account directory and hit the Command + Shift + . shortcut to view all the hidden files in it.\nNext, depending on the active shell on your system, find any one of the following files: .bashrc, .bash_profile, .zshrc, or .zsh_profile. Right-click on a file and select Open With \u003e TextEdit.\nWhen the file opens in TextEdit, copy the following line and paste it into the file: export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\nHit Command + S to save the changes to the file and Command + W to close the file.\nSuccessfully Resetting the PATH Variable on Mac Modifying or setting the PATH environment variable on Mac isn’t easy if you don’t have prior experience and puts you at risk of breaking the terminal functionality with incorrect modification (delete/add/edit) of the entries in the PATH configuration files. So if/when you end up in such a situation on your Mac, you should be able to reset the PATH environment variable using this guide. And subsequently, restore the terminal’s functionality and re-address the paths to the programs/bash scripts you want to launch from anywhere on the file system.\n1. How do I reset my PATH variable? Resetting the PATH variable is possible either via the CLI or the GUI approach. So depending on your preference, you can pick either method to carry out the same. Follow the steps earlier in the post to find out the steps for both these methods.\n2. What is the default PATH variable in Mac? Ideally, the shell config or profile files comprise the following as the default PATH variable in Mac: /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin, to allow you to execute various programs or commands in the terminal without specifying their absolute paths.\n3. How do I fix my PATH environment variable? In the event that you accidentally messed up your Mac’s PATH environment variable entries, you can fix them by adding the default PATH entries to your shell configuration file. Depending on how you like to perform operations on your Mac, you can either do this using the GUI (Finder) or CLI (terminal) approach.\n4. PATH variable keeps resetting Mac? If the PATH variable keeps resetting on your Mac, it could be because it isn’t permanently set. And so, you must edit your system’s default shell config file and add the default paths along with the path for the program/script you intend you want to be accessible globally to it.\n","wordCount":"1607","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Robert Lofland"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-reset-the-path-variable-on-mac-to-default-macos-path-899744/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock the Secret to Streamlining Your Mac's Performance with This Genius Path Variable Hack!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 17, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1607 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Robert Lofland</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#when-would-you-want-to-reset-the-path-variable-in-macos>When Would You Want to Reset the PATH Variable in macOS?</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-reset-the-path-variable-in-macos>How to Reset the PATH Variable in macOS</a><ul><li><a href=#resetting-macos-path-variable-via-cli>Resetting macOS PATH Variable via CLI</a></li><li><a href=#resetting-macos-path-variable-via-gui>Resetting macOS PATH Variable via GUI</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#successfully-resetting-the-path-variable-on-mac>Successfully Resetting the PATH Variable on Mac</a><ul><li><a href=#1-how-do-i-reset-my-path-variable>1.

How do I fix my PATH environment variable?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-how-do-i-fix-my-path-environment-variable>#</a></h3><p>In the event that you accidentally messed up your Mac’s PATH environment variable entries, you can fix them by adding the default PATH entries to your shell configuration file. Depending on how you like to perform operations on your Mac, you can either do this using the GUI (Finder) or CLI (terminal) approach.</p><h3 id=4-path-variable-keeps-resetting-mac>4.

And so, you must edit your system’s default shell config file and add the default paths along with the path for the program/script you intend you want to be accessible globally to it.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-recover-hacked-facebook-account-without-email1962796/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Unlock the Secret to Recovering Your Hacked Facebook Account - No Email Required!</span></a>
