GPUs get hot when you are utilizing their power in a GPU-intensive application. A powerful GPU will handle even that but playing PC games on a higher-settings will definitely get its temperature higher. So, if you are doing the same and asking questions like is GPU temp important or how to lower GPU temp then you are at the right place. We will also cover topics on how do I monitor my GPU temperature, gpu temperature range and is 80 C too hot for GPU. In this guide, we are going to answer that and more about the GPU.\nHow to Lower Your GPU Temp We have shown the different ways to cool down GPU temperature on your PC.\nContents\nHow to Lower Your GPU Temp Is GPU Temp Important? Cleaning GPU Replacing Thermal Paste Fixing or Upgrading Airflow in Case Increasing Fan Speed Changing your Case Try GPU Water Cooling System Uninstall Recent GPU Driver Update Stop Overclocking Underclocking GPU What is the Safe GPU Temperature Range? Is 80 C too Hot for GPU? How do I Monitor my GPU Temperature Is GPU Temp Important? Yes, the GPU temperature is very important. An overheating GPU can lead to a decrease in performance or make it worse. If you are seeing a black screen suddenly while using your PC then take it as a warning and let your PC rest and cool off.\nThe temperature of a GPU rises when it is forced to run on a heavy workload for a longer period of time than just a few hours like for crypto mining. Cases like these will enable thermal throttling until the temperatures are back to normal. If your GPU is overheating and you are wondering, how do I lower my GPU temp then try the methods listed below.\n1. Cleaning GPU Open up your GPU and clean the inside and outside as well. You can use alcohol wipes and compressed air to wipe and clear the dust off. You should remove the cooler from the heatsink then disconnect the fan and clean it with a lint-free cloth and use the alcohol wipes to wipe the dust off from the graphics card.\n2. Replacing Thermal Paste Replacing the thermal paste can be the solution to lower GPU temp if not done recently. The thermal paste dries out after some time of use and if you don’t reapply it then it becomes one of the major reasons that can cause your GPU to overheat.\n3. Fixing or Upgrading Airflow in Case One of the most common reasons for the GPU overheating is bad airflow in the case. Try to improve the fan placements or increase the number of fans on the front and at the back as well for proper ventilation.\n4. Increasing Fan Speed Nowadays with GPU monitoring software you can easily set and control the fan speeds. With just a few clicks you can increase the fan speed. You can download the compatible software from the support page of your specific graphics card by the GPU manufacturer.\nAlso Read: How to Show CPU and GPU Temperature on Taskbar\n5. Changing your Case Before actually changing your case, you should try playing a game on your PC with the case open and if the temperature decreases when you do so. Then it’s time for you to get a new case. A bigger case with more fans or a mesh design by the fans will solve your problem.\n6. Try GPU Water Cooling System GPU water cooling system can cost you some penny but it does the work very efficiently. These are perfect for overclocked GPUs. If you are using an overclocked GPU with a generic fan then the chances are high for higher temperatures. GPU water cooling is the best solution in this case and you can see temperatures lower than 50 degrees Celsius.\n7. Uninstall Recent GPU Driver Update If you are experiencing high GPU temperatures after a driver update then you should consider rolling back to the last version before the update. Some updates can cause a rise in temperatures to at least 10 degrees Celsius. So, try this if you have a similar problem and always wait some time to see how the new update turns out before updating your GPU driver.\n8.

Try GPU Water Cooling System<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#6-try-gpu-water-cooling-system>#</a></h3><p>GPU water cooling system can cost you some penny but it does the work very efficiently. These are perfect for overclocked GPUs. If you are using an overclocked GPU with a generic fan then the chances are high for higher temperatures. GPU water cooling is the best solution in this case and you can see temperatures lower than 50 degrees Celsius.</p><h3 id=7-uninstall-recent-gpu-driver-update>7. Uninstall Recent GPU Driver Update<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#7-uninstall-recent-gpu-driver-update>#</a></h3><p>If you are experiencing high GPU temperatures after a driver update then you should consider rolling back to the last version before the update. Some updates can cause a rise in temperatures to at least 10 degrees Celsius. So, try this if you have a similar problem and always wait some time to see how the new update turns out before updating your GPU driver.</p><h3 id=8-stop-overclocking>8. Stop Overclocking<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#8-stop-overclocking>#</a></h3><p>Another way to lower GPU temp is by stopping Overclocking. Since, it can cause your GPU to heat up if you are doing it with a generic fan or a stock cooler. If that is the case then you are asking the coolers to do something that they are not capable of. Disabling overclocking can do the trick but if it doesn’t then you can underclock your GPU which should solve the problem.</p><h3 id=9-underclocking-gpu>9. Underclocking GPU<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#9-underclocking-gpu>#</a></h3><p>You can use third-party software to reduce the GPU temperatures by underclocking your GPU which not only reduces the power consumption but also increases the lifespan of the graphics card.</p><h3 id=what-is-the-safe-gpu-temperature-range>What is the Safe GPU Temperature Range?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-is-the-safe-gpu-temperature-range>#</a></h3><p>Every GPU have different safe ranges according to its capabilities. The modern NVIDIA GPUs should be below 85 degrees Celsius under full usage and the modern AMD GPUs should stay under 100 degrees Celsius under full. Some may exceed this limit by a few degrees before hitting their maximum temperature. The rule of thumb is that graphics cards should be under 80 degrees Celsius or 176 degrees Fahrenheit. To ensure the longevity of your GPU the normal temperatures should be much lower than the maximum temperature of your GPU.</p><h3 id=is-80-c-too-hot-for-gpu>Is 80 C too Hot for GPU?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#is-80-c-too-hot-for-gpu>#</a></h3><p>80 degrees Celsius is considered to be safe for most GPUs. It is not the most optimal temperature but it is also not that bad either.</p><p>Also Read: What is a Good Normal GPU Temp for Gaming?</p><h3 id=how-do-i-monitor-my-gpu-temperature>How do I Monitor my GPU Temperature<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-do-i-monitor-my-gpu-temperature>#</a></h3><p>Now that you know how to lower GPU temp, then if you are using Windows 10 or 11 then you can easily monitor your GPU temperature through the task manager.
