Well, now you can, by hacking ESPN’s live broadcasts and streaming UFC fights to your heart’s content. With the 2023 UFC season on the horizon, there has never been a better time to explore the world of live sports streaming, and we’ve got all the tips and tricks to help you get started.\nFirst and foremost, it’s important to note that hacking into a live broadcast is illegal, and we do not condone or promote any illegal activities. The purpose of this article is to provide information on a hypothetical situation where UFC fans could watch live fights using alternate methods.\nNow, with that out of the way, let’s talk about how you can stream UFC fights without having to pay for cable or satellite TV. ESPN is the official broadcaster of UFC fights in the US, and they offer their content via their streaming platform, ESPN+. However, ESPN+ isn’t a replacement for cable TV as it doesn’t allow live viewing of UFC’s main events. So how can you watch these main events without cable?\nOne option is to subscribe to a live streaming TV service like Sling TV, Hulu + Live TV, or DirecTV Now. All of these services offer ESPN as part of their package, though they can be costly, with prices ranging from $35 to $70 per month.\nAnother option, which we must stress is highly unadvisable, is to search for illegal streaming sites, which often livestream UFC fights without permission from the UFC or ESPN. However, these sites can open your computer up to malicious software, put you at risk for scams, and even result in legal action against you.\nThe best option with no ethical or legal dilemma? Purchase a Virtual Private Network (VPN), which encrypts your internet traffic and replaces your IP address with one of its own, rendering you anonymous on the web. You may also use it to connect to a server of a country where ESPN+ is available, regardless of your current location. With your VPN hiding your online activity from your internet provider, they will not be able to detect that it is you accessing ESPN+ through an “unauthorized” IP address. You may use this method to access ESPN+ and stream UFC fights without issue.\nIn conclusion, it is illegal to hack into an ESPN live broadcast or access them through illegitimate channels. We cannot emphasize enough that any illegal activity will result in serious consequences. Live streaming services and VPN-providers enable viewers to watch UFC without cable-dependency, and VPN connections give you the ability to stream ESPN+ whenever where ever you may be. Remember, no sporting event is worth breaking the law or jeopardizing your personal information. Stay safe and enjoy the UFC season!\nThe UFC debuted on the ESPN+ streaming service with a massive event that included a showdown between flyweight champion Henry Cejudo and bantamweight champion TJ Dillashaw to contest the flyweight belt.
