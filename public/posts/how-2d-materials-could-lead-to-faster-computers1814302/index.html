In the world of technology, making advancements fast and effectively has always been the ultimate goal of researchers. The pace of innovation in the tech world is incredible, and scientists are always pushing the boundaries in search of discoveries that can change the way we live our lives. In what is being hailed as a revolutionary discovery, scientists have uncovered 2D materials that could potentially change the game in computing.\nComputers have come a long way since their inception, and now, they form an integral part of our daily lives. We use them for work, entertainment, and even communication. However, as the demand for better and faster computers continues to rise, scientists have been searching for solutions that can keep up with this growing demand. That’s where 2D materials come in.\nTwo-dimensional materials, as the name suggests, are materials that are just a few atoms thick, yet they possess unique properties that make them ideal for use in high-performance electronic devices. The discovery of 2D materials is a relatively recent one, and since then, scientists have been exploring the countless possibilities they offer. They are incredibly strong and flexible and can conduct electricity extremely well.\nIn a paper published in the renowned journal Nature, researchers from the University of Sussex and the Donetsk Institute of Physics and Technology have discovered a type of 2D material that has the potential to revolutionize the computing industry. They have named this material “Perovskite”. What makes Perovskite so special is its ability to transfer electrons faster than any material known to man. This means that computers made using this material could potentially be 1,000 times faster than the current ones in use.\nThis breakthrough discovery has far-reaching implications for the future of computing. It could mean faster and more efficient data processing, which could be particularly useful in areas such as artificial intelligence, where huge amounts of data need to be processed quickly. Additionally, this new material could potentially mean smaller, more powerful computers that use less energy.\nWhile 2D materials have been hailed as the future of computing for several years, the unique properties of Perovskite make it a particularly exciting discovery. The paper’s lead author, Dr. Alan Dalton, explains that “Perovskite offers unprecedented electron mobility, surpassing all other 2D materials currently being studied. This has the potential to improve on traditional electronic properties such as transparency, energy efficiency and flexibility. This makes it ideal for use in computing and other emerging technologies.”\nThe discovery of Perovskite is a testament to the incredible work being done by researchers across the globe. This discovery is not just a one-off, but rather it marks another significant step in the evolution of 2D materials and their role in shaping the future of technology. While it may take some time before Perovskite materializes in the real world, it’s exciting to think about the possibilities it holds.\nIn conclusion, the discovery of Perovskite holds immense potential in the field of computing. It could pave the way for faster, more efficient, and more powerful computers, which could have far-reaching implications across different areas. While we still have much to learn about this new material, the future of technology looks brighter than ever before.\nRecent advances in physics could mean significantly faster computers leading to a revolution in everything from drug discovery to understanding climate change effects, experts say. Key Takeaways\nResearchers say that using two-dimensional materials could lead to faster computers. The discovery could be part of a coming revolution in the field that includes quantum computers. Honeywell recently announced that it had set a new record for quantum volume, a measure of overall performance. Scientists have detected and mapped the electronic spins in a new type of transistor. This research may lead to faster computers that take advantage of electrons’ natural magnetism instead of just their charge. The discovery could be part of a coming revolution in the field that includes quantum computers. “Quantum computers process information in a fundamentally different way than classical computers, which enable them to solve problems that are virtually unsolvable with today’s classical computers,” John Levy, co-founder and CEO of the quantum computing firm Seeqc, said in an email interview.\n“For instance, in an experiment performed by Google and NASA, the results from a specific quantum application were generated in a small number of minutes compared to the estimated 10,000 years it would take the most powerful supercomputer in the world.”\nTwo-Dimensional Materials In a recent discovery, scientists researched a new area called spintronics, which uses electrons’ spin to perform calculations. Current electronics use the electron charge to make calculations. But monitoring the spin of electrons has proved difficult. A team led by the Division of Materials Science at the University of Tsukuba claims to have used electron spin resonance (ESR) to monitor the number and location of unpaired spins moving through a molybdenum disulfide transistor. ESR uses the same physical principle as the MRI machines that create medical images. To measure the transistor, the device had to be cooled to just 4 degrees above absolute zero. “The ESR signals were measured simultaneously with the drain and gate currents,” Professor Kazuhiro Marumoto, co-author of the study, said in a news release. “Imagine building a quantum computer application sufficient to simulate the safety and efficacy of clinical drug trials—without ever testing them on a real person.”\nA compound called molybdenum disulfide was used because its atoms form a nearly flat two-dimensional (2D) structure. “Theoretical calculations further identified the origins of the spins,” Professor Małgorzata Wierzbowska, another co-author, said in the news release. Advances in Quantum Computing Quantum computing is another area of computing that is rapidly advancing. Honeywell recently announced that it had set a new record for quantum volume, a measure of overall performance. “This high performance, combined with low error mid-circuit measurement, provides unique capabilities with which quantum algorithm developers can innovate,” the company said in the release. While classical computers rely on binary bits (ones or zeros), quantum computers process information via qubits, which because of quantum mechanics, can exist either as one or zero or both at the same time—exponentially increasing processing power, Levy said. Quantum computers can run an array of significant scientific and business problem applications previously thought to be impossible, Levy said. The usual speed measures like megahertz don’t apply to quantum computing. The important part about quantum computers isn’t about speed in the way we think about speed with traditional computers. “In fact, those devices often operate at much higher speeds than quantum computers,” Levy said.\n“The point is that quantum computers can run an array of important scientific and business problem applications previously thought to be impossible.”\nIf quantum computers ever become practical, the ways the technology could impact individuals’ lives through research and discovery are endless, Levy said. “Imagine building a quantum computer application sufficient to simulate the safety and efficacy of clinical drug trials—without ever testing them on a real person,” he said.\n“Or even a quantum computer application that can simulate entire ecosystem models, helping us better manage and combat the effects of climate change.”\nEarly-stage quantum computers already exist, but researchers are struggling to find a practical use for them. Levy said that Seeqc plans to deliver within three years “a quantum architecture that’s built around real-world problems and has the ability to scale to meet the needs of businesses.”\nQuantum computers won’t be available for the average user for years, Levy said. “But the business applications for the technology are already making themselves apparent in data-intensive industries such as pharmaceutical development, logistics optimization, and quantum chemistry,” he added.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1294","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-06T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jacqueline Romero"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-2d-materials-could-lead-to-faster-computers1814302/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionary Discovery: Scientists Uncover 2D Materials That Promise to Usher in a New Era of Blazing Fast Computers!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 6, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1294 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jacqueline Romero</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#heading></a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#two-dimensional-materials>Two-Dimensional Materials</a></li><li><a href=#advances-in-quantum-computing>Advances in Quantum Computing</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=revolutionary-discovery-scientists-uncover-2d-materials-that-promise-to-usher-in-a-new-era-of-blazing-fast-computers>Revolutionary Discovery: Scientists Uncover 2D Materials That Promise to Usher in a New Era of Blazing Fast Computers!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#revolutionary-discovery-scientists-uncover-2d-materials-that-promise-to-usher-in-a-new-era-of-blazing-fast-computers>#</a></h1><p>In the world of technology, making advancements fast and effectively has always been the ultimate goal of researchers.
