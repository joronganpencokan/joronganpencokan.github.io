If you’re a fan of online games, chances are that you’ve played Goose Goose Duck. This multiplayer game has gained a massive following since its release in 2020, and it’s not hard to see why. With its wide variety of game modes and thrilling gameplay, Goose Goose Duck is an addictive and fun game that will keep you coming back for more.\nBut with so many game modes to choose from, it can be hard to know where to start. That’s why we’ve put together this ultimate guide to help unlock the secrets of Goose Goose Duck’s game modes.\nThe Classic Game Mode The classic game mode is where it all started. The premise is simple: players are divided into crewmates and imposters, with the imposters trying to kill off the crewmates without being discovered. Meanwhile, the crewmates need to complete tasks on the spaceship to win the game. If all the tasks are completed before the imposters kill everyone, the crewmates win. But if the imposters eliminate all the crewmates, the game is over.\nThis game mode is great for beginners, as it’s easy to understand and provides a good introduction to the game’s mechanics. But don’t be fooled – just because it’s the classic mode doesn’t mean it’s easy to win. Imposters have a variety of tricks up their sleeves, from venting to fake tasks, which can make it challenging for the crewmates to figure out who the imposters are.\nHide and Seek One of the most popular variations of the classic game mode is hide and seek. In this mode, there are no tasks to complete – instead, the crewmates must hide from the imposters. The imposters are faster and can kill with just one hit, making it essential for crewmates to stay out of their way. The game ends when either all crewmates have been killed, or when a certain amount of time has passed, and the crewmates win.\nHide and seek is a fun and fast-paced game mode that’s perfect for those who want a break from completing tasks. It’s also a great way to work on your evasion skills, as crewmates need to stay hidden and move quickly to avoid the imposters.\nZombie Mode In Zombie Mode, players are divided into two groups: humans and zombies. The humans need to complete tasks on the spaceship while staying safe from the zombies. Once a human is killed by a zombie, they become a zombie themselves and must try to infect the remaining humans. The game ends when either all humans have been turned into zombies, or when all tasks have been completed.\nZombie Mode is an interesting twist on the classic game mode that adds a whole new level of intensity. As a human, you need to stay alive while completing tasks, but as a zombie, you’ll need to work quickly to infect as many humans as possible.\nConclusion Goose Goose Duck has gained widespread popularity because of its unique game modes and thrilling gameplay. Whether you prefer the classic game mode or one of the many variations, there’s always something new to discover in this game. With this ultimate guide, you can unlock the secrets of Goose Goose Duck’s game modes and take your gaming experience to the next level. So what are you waiting for? Get out there and start playing!\nGoose Goose Duck is similar to Among Us in many ways but its game modes and roles make it different. In this social deduction game by Gaggle Studios, you get to play different modes, each with different rules. So if you are weary of playing the regular hunter and survivor genre, you can try the other modes to stay entertained with your friends. This guide will go over all the modes you can try in this game.\nAll Game Modes in Goose Goose Duck The devs constantly add new updates to keep the player base entertained. As of now, you can play the following Game Modes in Goose Goose Duck:\nTable of Contents\nClassic Draft (Classic+) Goosehunt Duck and Dash Trick or Treat Hanging Out Classic In this mode, you can either play as a Goose or other birds like the Duck. The Geese can win by completing all the tasks or eliminating Ducks. While the Ducks can win by eliminating the Geese or Sabotaging certain tasks. If the number of surviving Geese is less than the Ducks then the latter wins. You will also have roles so know more about them in our All Goose Goose Duck Roles guide.\nDraft Previously known as Classic+, this mode assigns numbers to every player in the lobby. Based on that number, you get a chance to pick a role for yourself. Since roles are a big part of this mode, you can check our guide on the Best Role Settings to know more.\nGoosehunt Game Mode In this mode, a single Duck will try to eliminate all the Geese within a limited time period. The Geese can reduce the timer by completing tasks. But there are no meetings so the Ducks can go on a killing spree. Moreover, their movement speed is faster than the Geese. This mode is optimal for lobbies with fewer players.\nDuck and Dash Trick or Treat Game Mode In this mode, the players are divided into Villagers and Monsters (Vampires \u0026 Mummies). Monsters can win by converting every villager into a Thrall. These Thralls can turn other Villagers into Thralls. However, villagers can kill the Thralls but they respawn after a 15-second cooldown. For Villagers to win, they can complete tasks to host meetings and eliminate monsters. If every monster is eliminated or a Villager survives till the timer runs out, the Villagers win the game.\nHanging Out This game mode features the Lounge map. Here, you can hang out with friends and play minigames. Check out our map guide for the Lounge for more information.\nThese are all the Game Modes you can play in Goose Goose Duck.
