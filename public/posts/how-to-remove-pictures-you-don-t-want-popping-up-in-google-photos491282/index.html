Have you ever stumbled upon an old picture of yourself on Google that you wish could just disappear? Maybe it was from a wild party or just an unflattering snapshot during a bad hair day. Whatever the case may be, the good news is that you can permanent remove these photos from the internet, and ensure your privacy remains protected.\nDeleting unwanted Google photos can be done in just a few steps. Here is a guide on how to do it:\nStep 1: Locate the photo\nThe very first step is to locate the photo that you want to delete from Google. Open Google and type in your name or anything related to the picture. If you know the exact website where the photo appears, it will be even easier to find it.\nStep 2: Request removal\nNext, send a request to Google for removal of the unwanted photo. To do this, visit Google’s removal site and fill out the information requested. You will need to provide the URL of the photo and the reason for the request. If you do not know the URL, you can still request removal by providing sufficient information about the photo.\nStep 3: Fill out the form\nAfter providing the details, you will come to a form with additional information to complete. You will have to provide your email address and phone number for verification purposes. Google will send a verification code to the phone number provided.\nStep 4: Verify your identity\nThis is the most crucial step in the process. After receiving the verification code, enter it on the form, and click the “Verify” button. By doing so, you confirm that you are the rightful owner of the photo and have the authority to remove it from the internet.\nStep 5: Wait for Google’s confirmation\nThat’s it! You’ve done your part. Now, all you have to do is wait for Google’s confirmation of the removal request. The approval process usually takes around a week to complete, so be patient.\nIn conclusion, the process of deleting unwanted Google photos is not complicated, but it requires a certain level of caution to ensure that you do not delete the wrong ones inadvertently.
