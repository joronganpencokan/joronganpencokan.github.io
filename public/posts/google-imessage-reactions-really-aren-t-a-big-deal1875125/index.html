With the introduction of instant messaging applications, keeping in touch with friends, colleagues, and family has become a breeze. Among the most popular instant messaging applications is Google’s iMessage.\nGoogle iMessage offers a range of exciting features, including the ability to react to messages using emojis. However, according to experts, these reactions may not be as crucial as users might think. Here’s why.\nFirstly, reactions can be inaccurate. Although emojis are meant to convey emotions, it’s not always easy to interpret the intended sentiment. For instance, a smiley emoji could mean happiness, sarcasm, or even rage. As such, users could misinterpret reactions and end up making inappropriate comments or decisions.\nMoreover, reactions can be manipulative. In some cases, users may use reactions as a passive-aggressive way to express their disapproval or disdain. This kind of behavior is especially rampant in group chats, where users may gang up on a member they dislike or disagree with. Such manipulative reactions could escalate conflict and create a toxic atmosphere.\nLastly, reactions can be a distraction. With the abundance of emojis available, it’s easy to get carried away and spend more time reacting to messages than actually reading and responding to them. This distraction can have serious implications, such as neglecting urgent messages, missing deadlines, and failing to pay attention to critical information.\nIn conclusion, while Google iMessage reactions can be a fun way to express oneself, experts caution against overreliance on them. As with any communication tool, it’s essential to use reactions responsibly, accurately, and purposefully. Don’t let emojis distract you from meaningful conversations and connections!\nAfter complaining that Apple doesn’t support RCS messages on the iPhone, Google has upped its bet and added support for iMessage tapbacks in Google Messages. Key Takeaways\nGoogle will translate iMessage Tapback reactions into emojis.Google users cannot send tapbacks back to iPhone users. The translations in the current beta are a little odd. Apple’s iMessage app is the only major messaging platform that supports SMS, a quirk that dates back to the original iPhone, which combined SMS and iPhone-to-iPhone messages into the same app. This extra ability has caused problems over the years, most recently with complaints that Apple should stop ostracizing “green-bubble” contacts by excluding them from some features. Now, Google’s Messages app will do what Apple won’t and translate iMessage tapbacks into emojis. “I wish there was the same on the incoming side because if you’re in a group chat with part iPhones and part Android phones, you see, like ‘Katie liked blah blah blah’, and I wished that Apple just parsed those [to turn them back into tapbacks],” said Apple podcaster Casey Liss on the Accidental Tech Podcast.\nGoogle Translates This feature concerns’ tapbacks.’ iMessage users can long-press on a message and apply a quick emoji-style reaction. They can heart the message, add a thumbs up or down, and so on. But these only work with iMessage. If an iPhone user is in a conversation with a friend using an Android device (a green bubble friend), then the conversation is conducted via SMS. The Android user will get a text description of the tapback. It might tell you that someone “loved an image,” for example.\nNow, Google translates these text messages into emojis. But like all Google translations, this one loses a little something along the way. Apple’s heart tapback is turned into a 😍 emoji. An exclamation mark is turned into 😮 and Haha is translated as 😂 .\n“Google’s current translation choices can be somewhat strange for certain tapbacks,” business communications specialist Joe Taylor told Lifewire via email. “However it should be noted that the iMessage translations feature is still in Beta, and there will likely be tweaks here and there with user feedback. But if certain translations go through to public release, then confusion could arise which could either be funny or awkward.” Should Apple Integrate SMS Better? A recent Wall Street Journal article complained about the green bubbles that the Messages app assigns to non-iMessage messages. It claimed that Apple was using this to pressure youngsters into buying iPhones to conform to social pressure. But this is an iMessage difference, not an Android difference. SMS messages from iPhones also turn green.\nBut should Apple better integrate SMS into its messaging app? First of all, SMS has no support for emojis. It’s text all the way. Second, no other messaging platform other than Apple’s and Google’s Messages apps integrates SMS. Not Signal, not Telegram, not Facebook, or anyone else. Another barrier is that SMS is tied to a phone number. That’s ok if you’re on an iPhone and you’re happy with sharing your phone number. But you don’t have a phone number on the Mac and iPad. If you also have an iPhone, it can forward SMS messages to those devices, but otherwise, it’s a phone-only option.\n“iMessage translations feature is still in Beta, and there will likely be tweaks here and there with user feedback.”\nThe real problem is that we still use SMS. It’s an old, outdated system that’s unencrypted and tied to a phone number. The only thing it has going for it is universality. Like email, SMS is not tied to a single vendor. It is open to anyone with a phone. Google’s proposed replacement for SMS—called RCS—is just as bad in terms of security and being tied to a phone number. Apple is probably right to spend as few resources as possible on supporting SMS and even RCS. But there’s one thing it should fix up ASAP: Tapback. It’s terrible. It has only six options. Why can’t you choose from all the emojis, like you can in messaging apps like Slack? Get on that Apple, please. It’s probably not difficult.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"991","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Murray Reid"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/google-imessage-reactions-really-aren-t-a-big-deal1875125/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't believe it: Experts reveal the shocking truth about why Google iMessage Reactions aren't as important as you think!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 17, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;991 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Murray Reid</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#heading></a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#google-translates>Google Translates</a></li><li><a href=#should-apple-integrate-sms-better>Should Apple Integrate SMS Better?</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>You Won&rsquo;t Believe It: Experts Reveal the Shocking Truth About Why Google iMessage Reactions Aren&rsquo;t as Important as You Think!</p><p>In recent years, communication has undergone a significant transformation.
