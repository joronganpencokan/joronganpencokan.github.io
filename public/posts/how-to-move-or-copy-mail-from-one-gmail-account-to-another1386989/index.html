Are you tired of juggling multiple email accounts? Do you wish there was an easy way to transfer all your important messages to a new Gmail account? Look no further than this simple Gmail hack that will save you time and hassle.\nWith just a few clicks, you can instantly move or copy your entire mailbox from one Gmail account to another. This is particularly useful when you’re switching to a new email address or consolidating multiple accounts into one.\nSo, how do you do it? Follow these simple steps:\nStep 1: Create a new Gmail account\nThe first step is to create a new Gmail account to transfer your messages to. If you’re already setting up a new account, great, you can skip this step.\nStep 2: Enable IMAP in both accounts\nIn order to transfer your messages between Gmail accounts, you’ll need to enable IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) in both accounts. This can be done by navigating to the “Settings” menu in your Gmail account, selecting “Forwarding and POP/IMAP”, and then enabling IMAP.\nStep 3: Add your old Gmail account to the new one\nNext, you’ll need to add your old Gmail account to the new one. To do this, go to the “Settings” menu in your new Gmail account, select “Accounts and Import”, and then click on “Import mail and contacts”.\nFrom there, enter the email address of your old Gmail account and follow the prompts to allow access. This will automatically begin the process of transferring your messages to your new account.\nStep 4: Choose your transfer options\nYou can choose to move or copy your messages to your new account. Moving your messages will remove them from your old account and place them in your new one, whereas copying your messages will create duplicates in your new account without deleting the originals in your old one.\nStep 5: Sit back and relax\nOnce you’ve chosen your transfer options, sit back and let Gmail do the work! Depending on the number of messages you’re transferring, this process may take some time. However, you can close your browser window and allow the transfer to continue in the background.\nCongratulations! You’ve learned how to easily transfer your Gmail messages to a new account. This hack can save you time and hassle, particularly if you’re managing multiple email addresses or need to consolidate your messages into one account.\nRemember, you can always repeat this process in reverse if you ever need to transfer your messages back to your original account. Give it a try and enjoy the freedom and convenience of a freshly consolidated inbox.\nThis article explains how to configure POP access and then use one of two methods to migrate messages between Gmail accounts: fetch emails using Gmail, or manually transfer emails with an email program like Outlook. Also included are instructions to stop importing mail.\nWhat to Know\nIn Gmail, go to Settings \u003e See All Settings \u003e Forwarding and POP/IMAP.

Then skip to the next section.\nIf you haven’t yet activated POP:\nFrom your Gmail account, select the Settings gear icon in the accounts toolbar. Select See All Settings.

Select delete Gmail’s copy to move mail instead of copying it. This option moves old messages to the trash, so you won’t be able to get them later. Select keep Gmail’s copy in the Inbox to leave the original message untouched. Choose mark Gmail’s copy as read to leave the original email in the Inbox and mark it as read.

Open the message from Gmail Team with the subject Gmail Confirmation - Send Mail as username@gmail.com. Highlight and copy the numeral confirmation code under Confirmation code. It is better not to follow the verification link and instead login with the correct account in your browser first, then use the code there. As an alternative to the somewhat convoluted process that follows, you can wait for your new Gmail account to import the verification message and follow the confirmation link from there. Select your account’s icon in the top right corner. Select Sign out. Log in to Gmail again, this time with the account to which you’re importing. Select the Settings gear icon. Click See All Settings. Open the Accounts and Import tab. Select Verify for the old Gmail account’s address under Send mail as.

Select See All Settings. Go to the Accounts and Import category. Select delete for the Gmail account from which you imported under Check mail from other accounts.
