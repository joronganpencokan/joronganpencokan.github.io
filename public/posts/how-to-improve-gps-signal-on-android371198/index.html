From navigating through the bustling city streets to planning for an adventurous hike, GPS navigation makes life simpler and more convenient. However, it can be frustrating when GPS signals are weak or lost, and you’re left stranded in an unknown location. If you’re tired of experiencing such situations, don’t worry! We’re here to guide you through the ultimate guide to enhancing GPS signal on your Android device.\nCalibrate the Compass\nOne of the simplest ways to improve the GPS signal on your Android device is by calibrating the compass. The compass is responsible for calculating your direction, and if it’s not calibrated properly, it can affect the GPS signal accuracy. To calibrate the compass on your Android device, follow the steps below:\nOpen the Google Maps app on your device. Tap on the blue dot that represents your location. Tap on the Calibration button at the bottom of the screen. Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the compass. Disable Battery Saving Mode\nSaving battery is an essential feature, but it can negatively impact the GPS signal. When the battery saving mode is enabled, it reduces the GPS signal strength to conserve battery life, resulting in slow or lost GPS connections.\nTo disable battery saving mode on your Android device, follow the steps below:\nGo to the Settings app on your device. Scroll down to Battery \u0026 performance and tap on it. Tap on Battery Saver. Toggle the switch off to disable Battery Saver mode. Switch to High Accuracy Mode\nAnother effective way to boost the GPS signal on your Android device is by switching to high accuracy mode. High accuracy mode provides the most accurate GPS signal by using GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular networks to determine your location.\nTo switch to high accuracy mode on your Android device, follow the steps below:\nGo to the Settings app on your device. Scroll down to Location and tap on it. Tap on Mode. Select High Accuracy from the list of options. Update Google Play Services\nUpdating Google Play services is crucial for enhancing GPS signal accuracy on your Android device. Google Play services is responsible for keeping your device updated with the latest technologies and features, including the GPS system.\nTo update Google Play services on your Android device, follow the steps below:\nGo to the Google Play Store app on your device. Tap on the three-lined menu icon at the top left corner. Tap on My apps \u0026 games. In the Updates tab, find Google Play services and tap on Update. Clear Cache and Data of Google Maps\nClearing the cache and data of the Google Maps app is essential for enhancing GPS signal accuracy. Over time, the Google Maps app accumulates a lot of data and cache, which can lead to slow performance and inaccurate GPS signals.\nTo clear the cache and data of the Google Maps app on your Android device, follow the steps below:\nGo to the Settings app on your device. Scroll down to Apps and tap on it. Find Google Maps and tap on it. Tap on Clear Cache and Clear Data. In conclusion, by following these tips, you can significantly enhance the GPS signal on your Android device. With accurate GPS signals, you can confidently navigate through new locations without any worries or stress. Remember always to keep your device up to date and avoid using the GPS system in heavy metal environments, where signals can frequently black-out. Happy navigating!\nGPS sensor lets you use your phone as a navigational device using apps such as Google maps and lets apps determine your geo-location. It is crucial to have good signal to get accurate location. So, read on to learn How to improve GPS signal on Android.\nBefore you start to optimize the GPS signal, it is important to understand what GPS actually is and how it works. It stands for Global Positioning System and was developed by the US army in 1973 and was released to public in 1995. There are total of 31 GPS satellites orbiting the Earth. Your device communicates with these satellites to determine your geo-location. The three most common factor that affects the strength of GPS signal are – the number of satellites at your location, the quality of your device’s hardware and the driver. Now that you have some knowledge about it, here’s how you can improve GPS signal on Android.\nToggle High Accuracy mode Although this mode will drain a significant amount of battery, it insures you have the best possible signal. However, you can always revert back to normal mode or even turn GPS off when the work is done. To enable High accuracy mode, go to Settings \u003e Location \u003e turn on the service if needed \u003e Tap on Mode \u003e and finally select High accuracy. This mode will use your GPS as well as your mobile network and your Wi-Fi to determine your current location.\nKeep GPS signal active Android automatically turns off GPS when going from one app to another to save battery. If you don’t want to experience any decrease in GPS signal strength, I recommend using an app called GPS connected. This small app will keep your GPS signal active. Note that doing this will result in reduced battery life.\nDiagnose your GPS hardware and software There could be an issue related to your device’s GPS hardware or software. If that’s the case, you are probably not getting the signal strength you deserve. Using an app called GPS Essentials, you can determine if there is any issue in your GPS hardware or software. In the main menu, tap on Satellites and watch your device connecting to the satellites orbiting the Earth. If you see no satellites, the problem is your GPS hardware. Either there is some interference from metallic objects or your GPS antenna is not working properly. If you see the satellites but the GPS is still not working properly, then it is a software issue.\nRefresh GPS data It is possible that your device got ‘stuck’ to a certain GPS satellite even if it is not in range. You can easily fix this using the app called GPS Status \u0026 Toolbox. Using this you can clear the GPS data and make your device connect to the nearest satellite. To do so, tap on menu icon \u003e tap on Manage A-GPS state \u003e tap on Reset. Then, go back to Manage A-GPS state and then tap on Download. Your GPS data will be refreshed.\n[quote bcolor=”#3ea3c1″ arrow=”yes”]\nAlso Read:\nTop Hidden Android Secret Codes Prisma app Tips and Tricks How to block Android games from using mobile data [/quote]\nTAGSAndroid Fixhow to android fix How to Fix Samsung Galaxy S22 Overheating?
