With social media platforms like Facebook, it’s now possible to communicate with anyone, anywhere, anytime. Apart from sending messages and posting updates, Facebook provides an excellent means of making voice and video calls.\nMaking voice and video calls on Facebook has been around for a while. However, not everyone is aware of the many benefits that come with it. Whether you’re looking to make personal or business calls, Facebook has you covered. The platform’s voice and video call features are user-friendly, seamless, and reliable, making it easier to communicate with people across the globe.\nSo, how can you revolutionize your communication game? Here are some essential secrets to making seamless voice and video calls on Facebook:\nEnsure a stable internet connection Having a strong internet connection is essential when making voice and video calls on Facebook. Without a reliable connection, the video or audio quality will be poor, and the call may experience interruptions.\nTo avoid such issues, always check your internet connection before making calls. Avoid using public Wi-Fi as they are usually slow and not secure. Instead, opt for a private and secure Internet connection like home Wi-Fi, mobile hotspots, or even ethernet.\nUse headphones or earphones Using headphones or earphones during calls on Facebook enhances sound quality and minimizes background noise. It also allows you to speak more freely since you don’t have to hold the device next to your ear.\nIn addition, using earphones provides privacy for your calls, especially in public spaces, and prevents distractions. When making office-related calls, headphones or earphones can reduce the risk of noise pollution and improve speech intelligibility.\nAdjust your settings Before making any Facebook Voice or Video calls, ensure you’ve adjusted your device’s settings to allow the Facebook app access to your microphone and camera. This will avoid any technical difficulties during calls and help ensure that audio and video sharing go smoothly.\nIn addition, ensure that none of your apps or programs are using the same audio or video resources. This prevents audio or video conflicts when making calls.\nOptimize your camera position When making video calls on Facebook, it’s crucial to find the optimal camera position. Ensure that your camera’s position is in a well-lit area to prevent blurry images, shadows, or underexposure from affecting the video quality.\nMoreover, position yourself in a place with a clean and neat background. A cluttered or messy background can be distracting and could affect the call’s overall quality.\nUtilize Facebook Messenger’s Features Facebook Messenger offers various features to enhance user experience during video and voice calls. For example, the ‘Screen Share’ feature, which allows you to share your screen with the people you’re calling. This could be beneficial for group calls or when giving presentations.\nMessenger also offers the ‘Backgrounds’ feature, which allows you to select an image or background that you want to show during calls, masking your actual background. This feature is helpful when you don’t want to show your room but still want to make the call fun.\nIn conclusion, with these secrets to making seamless voice and video calls on Facebook, you can revolutionize your communication game. You can make calls with anyone, anywhere, using Facebook’s robust features, and have a more engaging and enriched communication experience.\nThis article explains how to make voice and video calls on Facebook, whether it’s via the website and app, or the Facebook Portal device. The process for doing so is the same whether you’re on your computer or your phone or tablet.\nWhat to Know\nStart a video call on Facebook: Open a conversation and select the video camera icon.Make a voice call on Facebook: Open a conversation and select the phone icon.Voice and video calls are not supported on the Facebook mobile app or mobile website. Make Voice Calls on Facebook To make a free phone call from Facebook.com, Messenger.com, or the Messenger app, open a conversation with the recipient and select the phone icon at the top of the message box.\nWhile you’re in a voice call on Facebook, select the video button to request that the recipient enable video on their side. If they do, your audio call is converted to a video call.\nMake Video Calls on Facebook Starting a video call on Facebook is as easy as making a phone call. Open a conversation with the recipient, then select the video camera to start the video call. This works anywhere you can access the calling features: Facebook.com, Messenger.com, and the desktop and mobile Messenger apps.\nFacebook voice calls used to work in the Facebook app in 2013. However, now you can only make an audio call with Facebook from a phone or tablet through the Messenger app.\nDuring a Facebook video call, select the video icon to disable the video camera. This converts the conversation to an audio call.\nFacebook Calling Requirements The Facebook mobile app and mobile website don’t support audio or video calls. What you need is access to either the Facebook desktop website or the messaging app called Messenger.\nMessenger works on computers at Messenger.com, or you can download Messenger to your computer. Another way to use the Facebook voice calling or video calling feature is to get the Messenger app on your phone or tablet. It’s available for iOS and Android.\nThe same app is used for both video calls and audio calls, so you don’t need a separate Facebook app for each. To have a private video chat with someone over Facebook, use the same Messenger app that lets you make voice calls.\nWhen you make a VoIP Facebook call from a mobile device, you use the device’s mobile data plan, so it doesn’t count against the voice minutes you’re limited to by your carrier. If you use Facebook calling over Wi-Fi, it doesn’t count against your mobile data usage.\nYou cannot make a video call without a camera, nor are audio calls possible without a microphone. Your device needs to have those pieces of hardware either built-in or plugged in externally to call another user.\nNot all devices running the Messenger app can make video and voice calls. Some only support text messaging.\nHelp With Facebook Calls Using Facebook’s video and voice calling features requires that the computer or mobile device is set up correctly to accept these requests. Without these parameters in place, you can’t talk or share your video with your Facebook friends.\nIf you’re making a Facebook call from a computer, make sure that the webcam and microphone are properly plugged in and working. If you use a web browser for the Facebook call, pop-up blockers might interfere with the call. You must also enable the browser to access the camera and microphone, or the other person can’t see or hear you.\nFor example, to make Facebook calls from Chrome, allow camera and mic access to permit Facebook to use the hardware during the call. Chrome also needs to allow pop-ups for Facebook or Messenger to ensure that calls can come through.\nAnother example where you need to set up proper permissions is when you use an iPad to make a video call or voice call on Facebook. Open Settings \u003e Messenger and enable Microphone and Camera so that your friends can see and hear you during a call. Similar steps are necessary for Android and other mobile devices.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1269","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-12T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-12T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Edward Flagge"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-make-voice-and-video-calls-on-facebook140633/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionize Your Communication Game: Learn the Secrets to Making Seamless Voice and Video Calls on Facebook!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 12, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1269 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Edward Flagge</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#heading></a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#make-voice-calls-on-facebook>Make Voice Calls on Facebook</a></li><li><a href=#make-video-calls-on-facebook>Make Video Calls on Facebook</a></li><li><a href=#facebook-calling-requirements>Facebook Calling Requirements</a></li><li><a href=#help-with-facebook-calls>Help With Facebook Calls</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Revolutionize Your Communication Game: Learn the Secrets to Making Seamless Voice and Video Calls on Facebook!</p><p>In today&rsquo;s fast-paced world, staying connected with your friends and loved ones has become easier, thanks to the advancements in technology.
