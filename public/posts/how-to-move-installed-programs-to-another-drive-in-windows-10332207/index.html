Thankfully, this task is not as complicated as you might think, and can be completed in just a few simple steps using the built-in Windows tools.\nStep 1: Create a backup of your important files\nBefore you start moving your programs, it’s important to create a backup of your important files such as documents, pictures, videos, and music. This will ensure that you don’t lose any data during the process. You can backup your files to an external hard drive or a cloud storage service like Google Drive or OneDrive.\nStep 2: Identify the programs you want to move\nNext, you’ll need to identify the programs you want to move. You can do this by opening the Settings app, then clicking on the “Apps” section. Here, you’ll see a list of all the apps and programs installed on your computer.\nStep 3: Create a new folder on the new drive\nOnce you’ve identified the apps you want to move, you’ll need to create a new folder on the new drive where you will be moving them to. You can do this by opening Windows Explorer and navigating to the new drive, then right-clicking and selecting “New Folder”. Name the folder something like “Programs” or “Apps”.\nStep 4: Move the app to the new folder\nNow that you have a new folder on the new drive, it’s time to move the apps you identified in step 2 to the new folder. To do this, right-click on the app you want to move and select “Move”. Then, select the new folder on the new drive and click “Move” again.\nStep 5: Create a symbolic link\nAfter you’ve moved the app to the new folder, you’ll need to create a symbolic link. A symbolic link essentially creates a shortcut that points to the new location of the app, so that Windows won’t get confused when trying to find and launch the app.\nTo create a symbolic link, open the Command Prompt by typing “cmd” in the search bar and right-clicking on “Command Prompt” and selecting “Run as administrator”. Then, type the following command:\nmklink /J “C:\\Program Files\\AppName” “D:\\Folder\\AppName”\nReplace “AppName” with the name of the program you moved, “C:\" with the original location of the app, and “D:\" with the new location of the app.\nRepeat this process for every program you moved to the new drive.\nAnd that’s it! You’re all set. Your programs will now be running from the new drive, freeing up valuable storage space on your original drive. Remember to create a backup of your files before you begin, and always be cautious when moving important files or programs around.\nNow that you know how easy it is to move your programs to a new drive in Windows 10, you can start freeing up space on your computer and optimizing your storage. Happy organizing!\nWhen we install any application, software, or program on our PC or laptop, by default, it gets installed in the C-drive. Hence, with time, the C-drive starts filling up and the system speed slows down. This also affects the performance of other pre-installed applications, programs, and software. To prevent this, it is recommended to move some applications, software, and programs from the C-drive to any other empty folder or drive to free some space in it.\nHowever, sometimes, some of the applications, software, and programs do not function well if moved to another location. Therefore, the best way is to uninstall the program, install it again, and then move it to the desired location. This process is long and not suitable if the application, program, or software is big and important for the user.\nTherefore, Windows comes with a built-in utility that allows moving the applications, programs, and software from the system drive or C-drive to another location without uninstalling. But this built-in utility works only for the applications or programs which are manually installed and not for the pre-installed applications. This does not mean that you cannot move those pre-installed apps and programs. For them, you just need to put in some extra effort.\nIn this article, we will see different methods using which you can move the new as well as pre-installed applications, software, and programs from the C-drive to another drive.\nHow to Move Installed Programs To Another Drive In Windows 10 As discussed above, moving modern apps \u0026 programs from the C-drive is easy and it can be done by using the Windows built-in utility. But to move traditional applications and programs, you need to take the help of third-party applications like the Steam Mover or Application Mover. How these applications can be used to move traditional applications and programs is discussed below:\nContents\nHow to Move Installed Programs To Another Drive In Windows 10 Move Modern Applications or Programs using Windows Built-in Utility Move Installed Applications and Programmes using Steam Mover Move Installed Applications and Programmes using Application Mover 1. Move Modern Applications or Programs using Windows Built-in Utility Follow the given steps to move the modern applications and programs from the C-drive to another drive using the Windows built-in utility:\nOpen Settings of your computer by searching for it using the search bar.\nHit the enter button and Window Settings will open up.\nUnder Settings, click on the System option.\nUnder System, select Storage option from the menu appears at the left panel.\nFrom the right side window, click on Apps \u0026 features option.\nA list of all the apps and programs installed on your system will appear.\nClick on the application or the program you want to move to another drive. Two options will appear, click on the Move option.\nNote: Remember, you will only be able to move those applications and programs which you have installed from the store and not the pre-installed ones. A dialog box will open up which will prompt you to select the drive where you want to move the selected app.\nSelect the drive from the dropdown menu where you want to move the selected application or program.\nAfter selecting the drive, click on the Move button.\nYour selected application or program will start moving.\nOnce the process is completed, the selected application or program will move to the selected drive. Similarly, move the other applications to free some space on the C-drive.\n2. Move Installed Applications and Programmes using Steam Mover You can use the third party application Steam Mover, to move the pre-installed application or program from the C drive.\nSteam Mover: Steam Mover is a free program to move the games, files, and folders of the installed applications or programs from the C-drive to another drive to free some space on the C-drive. The tool does its job within seconds and with no issues.\nTo move the installed applications and programs from the C-drive to another drive using the Steam Mover, follow the below steps:\nFirst of all download Steam Mover using this link.\nVisit the above link and click on the Download button.

Click on the OK button after selecting the location folder.\nAfter selecting both the folders, click on the Arrow button available at the bottom of the page.\nNote: Before doing this process make sure the C drive is in an NTFS format and not FAT32 format. This is because the Steam Mover moves the applications and software by creating junction points. Hence, it does not work on the FAT32 formatted drivers.\nOnce you will click on the arrow, a command prompt window will appear which will show the commands that are running to change the location of different selected folders.\nAfter the execution is completed, to confirm that the selected folders have moved to the alternate folder, go to the alternate folder location and check there. All the selected C-drive applications and programs must have moved there.\nAfter completing the above steps, the pre-installed applications and programs will move to another drive using Steam Mover.\nAlso Read: Force Uninstall Programs which won’t Uninstall In Windows 10\n3.

Click on Yes when asked for confirmation.\nNow, browse the location for the Current path and select the program which you want to move from the C drive.\nBrowse the location for the New path and select the folder where you want to move the selected program.\nAfter selecting both the paths, click on the OK button to continue.\nNote: Make sure all the checkboxes are selected before you press OK.\nAfter some time, your selected program will move from the C-drive to the selected drive. To confirm, go to the folder you have selected under the New Path field and check there.\nSimilarly, move the other applications and programs from the C-drive to another drive to free some space on the C-drive.\nAfter completing the above steps, the selected pre-installed applications and programs will move to another drive using Application Mover.\nRecommended:\nPermanently Remove The Activate Windows 10 Watermark How to Rename Multiple Files in Bulk on Windows 10 Hopefully, using the above methods, you will be able to move the programs and the applications which are either pre-installed or installed by you from the C-drive to another drive in Windows 10.\n","wordCount":"1941","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Daniel Baker"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-move-installed-programs-to-another-drive-in-windows-10332207/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Move Your Programs To A New Drive In Windows 10 - Here's How!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 1, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1941 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Daniel Baker</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#how-to-move-installed-programs-to-another-drive-in-windows-10>How to Move Installed Programs To Another Drive In Windows 10</a><ul><li></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>title: You Won&rsquo;t Believe How Easy It Is To Move Your Programs To A New Drive In Windows 10 - Here&rsquo;s How!</p><p>If you&rsquo;re running low on storage space on your Windows 10 computer, you might be considering moving some of your programs to another drive to free up space.
