Are you tired of living in fear of the mighty Noceros? Do you want to become a legendary hunter and dominate this ferocious beast? Well, look no further because we have the ultimate troop strategies to help you reach your goal and unleash your inner hunter!\nFirstly, before delving into the strategies, it’s essential to understand Noceros thoroughly. Noceros is one of the most challenging monsters to defeat in Lords Mobile, mainly because of its special ability. Noceros has the power to boost its defense by 80% when its HP drops below 50%. Therefore, it’s imperative to have a well-planned attack strategy that considers this ability when confronting this monster.\nWithout further ado, let’s take a look at the best troop strategies for hunting Noceros.\nStrategy 1: The Classic Strategy This is the most common strategy for attacking Noceros, especially for lower-level players. The classic strategy involves deploying mostly infantry and cavalry troops with some ranged troops. The infantry serves as the meat shields that take the damage, while the cavalry and ranged troops deal the damage.\nIt’s recommended to have a ratio of 70% infantry and cavalry troops to 30% ranged troops. This is to ensure that you have enough meat shields while still dealing significant damage.\nStrategy 2: The Ranged Strategy If you have advanced troops like the T4 ranged troops, the ranged strategy is the best option. This strategy involves deploying a large number of ranged troops and fewer infantry and cavalry troops.\nThe primary advantage of this strategy is that ranged troops can deal damage while avoiding most of Noceros’s attacks. This means that they have a reduced risk of being killed, which significantly increases your chances of success.\nIt’s recommended to have a ratio of 80% ranged troops to 20% infantry and cavalry troops for this strategy.\nStrategy 3: The Siege Engine Strategy The siege engine strategy is considered the most effective strategy for killing Noceros. Siege engines such as Catapults and Ballistae deal massive amounts of damage to Noceros.\nThe strategy involves deploying a large number of siege engines and a small number of infantry and cavalry troops to cover them from Noceros’s attacks.\nIt’s essential to have a balanced ratio of 50% siege engines, 30% ranged troops, and 20% infantry and cavalry troops for this strategy to work effectively.\nStrategy 4: The Monster Hunter Strategy This strategy is best for players who have already killed many Noceros and have the Noceros Hunter gear. The strategy involves using only Noceros Hunting gear and troops for the attack.\nThe gear and troops are designed explicitly for killing Noceros and come with many bonuses that significantly increase your chances of success.\nIt’s essential to deploy a vast army with this strategy and to have enough healing troops in case of significant losses.\nIn summary, these four strategies are the best options for hunting and killing Noceros in Lords Mobile. It’s essential to consider the abilities of Noceros when choosing a strategy and to ensure that you have enough healing troops to mitigate losses.\nUnleash your inner hunter today and dominate Noceros with these insane troop strategies!\nStrategy games like Lords Mobile start as a mode of escapism but end up luring people in. The variety of troops and Building upgrades is what keeps players engaged. You can use the wide variety of upgrades available to build your base and choose from an array of heroes to fight and hunt. Players can also hunt down monsters for resources. Different kinds of Monsters spawn around the kingdom map giving players a chance to obtain various resources. One such Monster is the Noceros, and we’ll tell you how you can hunt it.\nHow to Hunt the Noceros in Lords Mobile? Before going to hunt the Noceros, players should align their troops according to their strengths and weaknesses. The Noceros has thick skin enabling him to withstand serious physical damage. His horns will affect your hero’s healing abilities. We recommend using The Sage of Storms, Incinerator, Elementalist, Snow Queen, and the Bombin’ Goblin to hunt the Noceros.\nPlayers can also use the Prima Donna and Child of Light as per their levels. We would recommend using these heroes in any combinations as these will be the most effective against the Norceros. Some paid heroes like the Witch Doll or the Dream Witch can also be used.\nOnce killed, the Noceros will drop materials and chests depending upon their level. The Noceros will also drop a Chipped horn, Crackling hide, Electric horn, Lightning vial, and Noceros Jewel. These materials can be used to craft a variety of event gear. These resources can also be used to craft other weapons. The Norceros will also drop the Hero chest which can be used to upgrade your heroes, the grade of the chest will depend on the level of the Norceros.\nThat’s all for this guide.
