A custom business card can help brand your image and provide your clients with a lasting impression. With Scribus software, creating the ultimate custom business card can be done in just a few easy steps.\nStep 1: Download Scribus\nScribus is a free and open-source desktop publishing software that you can download from their website. Depending on your operating system, choose the version that is appropriate for you. Once downloaded, install the software and open it.\nStep 2: Set up Your Document\nBefore you can start creating your business card, you need to set the document to match your preferences. Go to “File” and select “New” to create a new document. A “New Document” dialog box will appear. For a standard North American business card, set the width and height to 3.5 inches by 2 inches. You can also choose to add margins, depending on your design.\nStep 3: Decide on Your Design\nYour business card design should reflect your brand and the image you want to create. Scribus has a variety of tools that you can use to create your design. For example, you can use the “Text Editor” to add your company name, your name, and other contact information. You can also add images and shapes to enhance the design.\nStep 4: Customize Fonts and Colors\nYour font and color choices also play an important role in creating a professional image. Choose fonts that are readable and appropriate for your industry. You can also choose a color scheme that matches your corporate color or brand identity.\nStep 5: Print Your Business Card\nOnce you have finished customizing your design, go to “File” and select “Export.” Choose “PDF” as your file format, and save your file. You can then print your business cards using your preferred printing method.\nConclusion:\nCreating the ultimate custom business card using Scribus is an easy and cost-effective way to enhance your professional image. With a little creativity and imagination, you can create a business card that stands out from the rest. Use these easy steps to create a lasting and memorable impression with your clients.\nDesigning your own custom business card is not as hard as it may seem. You can have yours ready in less than an hour. Let’s see how you can do it with the open-source and free Scribus.\nInstall Scribus Scribus is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. You can download the exe/dmg/tar file from its website.\nIf you are using Ubuntu, Scribus is already available in Ubuntu Software Center, so you can install it from there. If not, open up the terminal and enter:\nAfter the installation completes, find it in your Applications menu and run it.\nDocument Setup If Scribus doesn’t present you with a “New Document” window, choose “File -\u003e New” or press Ctrl + N on your keyboard to create a new, blank document.\nWe won’t use margins for our simple business card design. So, zero all “Margin Guides” values on the bottom left of the window.\nWhen printing content that will be cut into smaller pieces, use bleeds to avoid wasting paper and ink.\n“Bleeds” are a safe space included in your design. They’re there to ensure that when you cut your business cards to their final size, you won’t be cutting dangerously close to useful information.\nFor that, move to the “Bleeds” tab on the bottom left of the window. Enter a typical value of “0,1250 in” for all of them.\nOne of the most popular standard sizes for business cards is 3,5 x 2 inches, but that’s without taking bleeds into account. So, enter “3,75” as your document’s width and “2,25” as its height (actual card size + bleeds).\nClick OK to accept the settings.\nA Classic, Simple, Eye-Catching Design Your card will appear relatively small in Scribus’s workspace.\nKeep Ctrl pressed and use your mouse wheel to zoom in. Use Space to switch to the move tool. Pan the screen to center your card. Press Space again to revert to the previously-selected tool.\nThe easy way to import a logo you have in image format is to drag and drop it from your favorite file manager on Scribus’s window.\nIs your logo’s frame too small/large? Right-click on it and select “Image -\u003e Adjust Frame to Image.”\nTo resize your logo, left-click on one of its bounding box’s corners and drag. Keep Ctrl + Alt held while doing it to keep its proportions and avoid any distortion.\nWith the Select tool active (C on the keyboard), move your logo where you want it on your card. We intentionally placed it on the top left, to then balance our card’s design by adding the rest of the information to the bottom right.\nNote: don’t place anything useful, like the logo or your details, outside your card’s bleed limits. They are “the red outline in your workspace.”\nSelect the Shape tool (S on the keyboard) and define a rectangle covering the top half of your card.\nIf you can’t see the Properties window on your screen, press F2 on your keyboard.\nExpand the “Colors” category, and from the “Fill” tab, select the color you’d like for your rectangle. We went for a classic black. Move to the “Stroke” tab and set it to “None.”\nScribus places new layers in front of existing ones. That’s why your newer rectangle will be covering your already existing logo. To fix the problem, “send your rectangle layer behind” your logo by right-clicking on it and choosing “Level -\u003e Lower to Bottom.”\nChoose the “Text Frame” tool (or press T on your keyboard) and define a text frame where you want your details. We chose the bottom right to, as we said before, keep our design balanced.\nType your name inside this frame. Since we wanted our details to appear on the right of the card, we also went for a right text alignment. You can find those settings, together with options for the font family, type, size, etc., in the “Text Properties” panel.\nContinue by adding your contact details. Use a different line for each piece of information to keep them easily readable. Select them and reduce their font size, keeping your name – the most important element on your card – larger.\nPreview your card with the shortcut Ctrl + Alt + P. Press it again to return to the normal editing mode. If you don’t like how your card looks, you can play with the arrangement, placement, and size of its elements.\nWhen you’re happy with the results, export them to an image file for printing using “File -\u003e Export -\u003e Save as Image…” or by pressing Ctrl + Shift + E on your keyboard. You can also export your document in EPS, PDF, SVG, or XPS formats if you prefer to keep its elements scalable.\nThe final step is, of course, the printing itself. If you do it yourself, you’ll be able to immediately see the results and, if needed, stop the process and apply adjustments. If you use a professional service, it’s better to ask them for a sample or start with a small test batch. It’s a shame to pay for thousands of printed cards that don’t look as you imagined.\nIf Scribus is not of your liking, check out this list of graphic design tools for non-designers or Adobe Indesign alternatives.\nOK’s real life started at around 10, when he got his first computer - a Commodore 128.
