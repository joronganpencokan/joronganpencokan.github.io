However, this noise can be a nuisance for those around you, especially if you use your keyboard in a shared space or during late nights. Thankfully, there are ways to silence your mechanical keyboard without losing its tactile feel. In this article, we will discuss the secrets to silencing your mechanical keyboard like a pro!\nO-rings O-rings are small rubber rings that can be placed on the stem of your mechanical keyboard’s switches. They effectively cushion the sound and reduce the noise when typing. O-rings come in different thicknesses to suit different switch types and personal preferences. They are easy to install and do not affect the typing feel of the keyboard.\nDampeners Dampeners are foam pads that sit between the switch plate and PCB of your mechanical keyboard. They help absorb the sound and reduce the vibrations that cause the clicking noise. Dampeners are available in various thicknesses and materials, such as silicone or neoprene. Installing dampeners requires disassembling your keyboard, but it is a worthwhile investment for a quieter typing experience.\nLubrication Lubricating the switches of your mechanical keyboard can also reduce the noise. It involves applying a thin layer of lubricant to the moving parts of the switch. This can be a bit more challenging as it requires precision and can affect the tactile feel of the switch if done improperly. It is essential to use the right type of lubricant for your switches to prevent damage.\nSound-absorbing foam Adding sound-absorbing foam inside your keyboard’s case can significantly reduce the noise level. The foam absorbs sound waves and prevents them from bouncing around inside the case. Sound-absorbing foam can be purchased online or from hardware stores. It is easy to install, but make sure to measure the dimensions of your keyboard to ensure a perfect fit.\nChange the switch type If none of the above methods work or you want to try something different, consider changing your switch type. Some switch types, such as Cherry MX Browns or Reds, are quieter than others. Switch types also have different actuation points and tactile feedback, so be sure to do research before making a switch (pun intended).\nIn conclusion, mechanical keyboards are an excellent investment for those who enjoy typing, gaming or just appreciates a durable keyboard with a satisfying feel. However, the noise can be a nuisance to others. With the above methods, you can silence your mechanical keyboard like a pro without losing its tactile and satisfying feel. Give them a try, and you may never go back to a membrane keyboard!\nMechanical keyboards are typically louder than other keyboards because the mechanical switches make noise when you press them. Some keys are louder than others, though, and there are ways to make a mechanical keyboard quieter even without replacing the keys.\nWhat to Know\nTry a desk mat as an easy way to make your keyboard quieter.Mechanical keyboards can also be dampened by inserting foam into the base or lubricating the switches.If you have clicky switches, the only way to make them quiet is to replace them with linear switches. Is There a Way to Make Mechanical Keyboards Quieter? There are several ways to make a mechanical keyboard quieter, but they don’t all work in every situation. If you have clicky keys, for example, you can replace them with silent linear keys. If your keys are already designed to be quiet, then noise probably indicates a lack of lubrication, worn-out o-rings, or the switches themselves may be wearing out.\nHere are the ways you can make a mechanical keyboard quieter:\nPress the keys carefully: If you have a specific type of tactile switch, you can prevent making noise by only pushing down on the keys just enough for the press to register but not hard enough to trigger the clicking sound.Use a desk mat: If you have tactile or linear switches, but they’re still too loud, a cushioned desk mat can absorb some sounds.Add a dampener: Take apart your keyboard, and check to see if there’s space to install a thin foam sheet in the bottom. If there is, the foam will help soak up some of the clicking noise from your keys.Install or replace your o-rings: Pop off your keycaps and check for o-rings on the switch stems. If there aren’t any o-rings, install some. If there are old o-rings present, replace them.Modify your key stabilizers: Big keys like your spacebar have stabilizers. If you take your keyboard apart, you can use a soft material like a bandaid to add a cushion, clip off parts of the stabilizer that strike the circuit board, or add some lubrication.Lubricate your switches: Remove each switch from the keyboard, take them apart with tweezers or a switch opener, and place them in a lubrication stand. Apply lube with a paintbrush, then reassemble.Replace the switches: If you have clicky switches, the only way to make them quieter is to replace them. Use linear switches, and choose silent linear switches for the quietest option possible. Hot-swappable switches can be removed and replaced with a puller, but soldered switches need to be desoldered. How Do You Lubricate Mechanical Keyboard Switches? Mechanical keyboard switches have to be removed and disassembled to lubricate them. You can take them apart without removing them, but that risks breaking the switches. Hot-swappable switches are easier to lube than soldered ones because they have to be desoldered to remove them.\nHere’s how to lubricate mechanical keyboard switches:\nIf you’re taking things apart to lubricate your switches, that’s a good time to clean your keyboard.\nRemove the switch caps using a keycap puller. Jeremy Laukkonen / Lifewire Remove the switches using a switch puller. Jeremy Laukkonen / Lifewire You can’t remove soldered switches with a switch puller. You need to desolder them to remove them. You can lubricate a soldered switch without removing it, but doing so may damage it. Take apart each switch using a switch opener or tweezers. Jeremy Laukkonen / Lifewire Don’t lose any of the internal components. Using tweezers can damage the switch. If possible, place the switches in a switch lubing station. Jeremy Laukkonen / Lifewire Apply lube to each switch with a paintbrush. Jeremy Laukkonen / Lifewire Reassemble the switches. Jeremy Laukkonen / Lifewire Place the switches back in the keyboard. Place the keycaps back on the switches. How Do You Dampen a Mechanical Keyboard? There are three ways to dampen a mechanical keyboard. You can place the keyboard on a desk mat, take the keyboard apart and place foam in the base, or install o-rings. If your keyboard already has o-rings, then replacing them may also help dampen your mechanical keyboard.\nRemove the switch caps using a keycap puller.\nRemove the switches using a switch puller.\nYou can’t remove soldered switches with a switch puller.

If you don’t like how your keys feel with o-rings, you have to choose between the sound reduction and the different feeling when pushing the keys.\nRemove the keycaps using a keycap puller. Jeremy Laukkonen / Lifewire Remove the old o-rings if any are present. Jeremy Laukkonen / Lifewire Place new o-rings. Jeremy Laukkonen / Lifewire If you have an RGB keyboard with keys that light up, use clear o-rings. Replace the keycaps.

Mechanical keyboards are easier to repair and customize since you can switch out the keys with little effort. Some users simply find mechanical keyboards more comfortable. How do I fix my mechanical keyboard? Depending on why your mechanical keyboard isn’t working, try unplugging and plugging it back in, using a different cable, or replacing the batteries. For sticky keys, try cleaning the keyboard with alcohol and canned air. If you’re still having problems, you might have to replace the key switch. How do I know if a keyboard is mechanical? The easiest way to tell if you have a mechanical keyboard is to lift a key cap off the keyboard to see if there is a switch underneath it.
