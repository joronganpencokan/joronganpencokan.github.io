Learn How to Limit Internet Speed with These Life-Saving Tips! If you are sharing your internet connection with multiple users, you may have experienced a slow internet speed at one point or another. Internet speed can become compromised when too many users are streaming videos or downloading files simultaneously. The good news is, you can limit internet speed and prevent your WiFi users from hogging the bandwidth. Here are some life-saving tips on how to do it:\n1. Use Quality of Service (QoS) Settings Most modern routers have QoS settings that allow you to prioritize bandwidth usage. By setting up QoS, you can allocate bandwidth to specific applications and devices. Music streaming and email applications can be allocated a lower priority while video streaming and online gaming can be given higher priority. This way, bandwidth is evenly distributed, and no single device or application becomes a bandwidth hog.\n2. Set Bandwidth Limits Another way to limit internet speed is to set up bandwidth limits. With most routers, you can set up restrictions on the amount of data that each device can consume. For example, if you have a 10 Mbps internet connection, you can set a limit of 2 Mbps per device, so you don’t run out of bandwidth. This way, everyone gets a fair share of the internet speed.\n3. Implement Parental Controls If you have kids at home who are also using the internet, you might want to consider implementing parental controls. Parental controls can provide a separate WiFi network for children with limited internet access. You can set the internet speed for this network to be slower than the regular network, ensuring that your kids don’t hog the bandwidth while doing their homework or watching cartoons.\n4. Use WiFi Network Monitoring Tools WiFi network monitoring tools can help you identify which devices are hogging the bandwidth. Tools like NetFlow Analyzer, PRTG Network Monitor, and SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor can all provide insight into the data usage of individual devices. By monitoring your WiFi network, you can identify where the bandwidth usage is coming from and take steps to limit internet speed for those devices.\n5. Upgrade Your WiFi Network If all else fails, it may be time to upgrade your WiFi network. If you have too many devices connected to an old router, it may become slow and unresponsive. A new router with the latest WiFi standard can increase the bandwidth and speed of your internet connection. Prioritizing devices with the newest WiFi technology can ensure that they get the best possible speed.\nIn conclusion, if your WiFi users are hogging the bandwidth, there are several ways to limit internet speed. By using QoS settings, setting bandwidth limits, implementing parental controls, using WiFi network monitoring tools, and upgrading your WiFi network, you can ensure that everyone gets a fair share of the internet speed. With these life-saving tips, you can prevent internet speed from becoming a sore point in your household or business.\nPeople can’t help themselves from going overboard every time they are connected to a free and strong WiFi network. They will begin to download movies, TV shows, update their device, download large software setup files or games, etc. Now, if you are the one providing this free WiFi, you will definitely feel the pinch in your pocket at the end of the month while paying the internet bill. Apart from that if multiple people are connected to your WiFi and actively using it, it simply means less bandwidth for you. This is unacceptable. We understand that it seems rude to deny friends and relatives or some times even the neighbors the WiFi password when they ask for it. You end up sharing your password with multiple people who relentlessly consume your bandwidth and data regularly. Therefore, we are here to provide you with a simple, elegant, and discreet solution to this problem.\nInstead of directly preventing people from connecting to your WiFi network, you can choose to reduce their internet speed and limit their bandwidth. Doing so will not only save you from paying excessively for overusing the internet but also mean more bandwidth for you. The best part is that you can easily do this yourself without even using any third-party tool or software. Most of the modern WiFi routers provide pretty decent administrative options to control several parameters like internet speed, available bandwidth, hours of access, etc. You can also block certain websites and rogue access points that could be potential hackers. In this article, we will discuss the various parental lock like features that you can utilize to prevent others from hogging your internet.\nHow can you Limit Internet Speed or Bandwidth of WiFi? The reason behind not getting enough speed while using the WiFi is because too many people are using it. By default, a WiFi router uniformly divides the total available bandwidth among all the devices connected to the network. This means that the more the number of devices connected to a network, the slower is your internet speed. The only way to reserve more bandwidth for yourself is to limit the bandwidth for other devices.\nContents\nHow can you Limit Internet Speed or Bandwidth of WiFi? What are the pre-requisites to Limit Internet Speed or Bandwidth of a WiFi? How to Limit Internet Speed in TP-Link router? How to Limit Internet Speed in D-Link router? How to Limit Internet Speed in Digisol router? How to Limit Internet Speed in Tenda router? What are some of the Other Restrictive measures that you can set for a WiFi network? This can be done by accessing the router settings. As mentioned earlier, every router has its separate firmware that can be used to edit several settings. Internet speed and the available bandwidth are just one of them. To restrict a particular person or device to a limited internet connection, you need to know their MAC address or their IP address. This is the only source of identification. You probably wouldn’t want to make a mistake as it might unnecessarily penalize the wrong person.\nIf you have the correct MAC address, then you can easily set the upper limit for the bandwidth and in turn, the internet speed that the person will be entitled to.

As mentioned earlier, limiting the Internet speed or Bandwidth isn’t the only thing that you can do to prevent people from misusing or exploiting your WiFi. Given below is a list of measures that you can take to avoid others from overusing your internet connection.\n1.Set Active Hours – You can limit the availability of internet access to certain fixed hours in a day and for certain days in a week. For example, you can restrict internet access on your office WiFi network to office hours and weekdays only. This will prevent employees from misusing the data.\nSet up Guest Access – Instead of giving out the actual password for your WiFi network, you can set up Guest Access. This allows internet access to people for a short duration of time, for example, you own a café or restaurant, then it more sensible to grant customers temporary guest access for the duration of which they are in your establishment. A guest network is a separate network, and this does not affect the internet speed of employees. You can easily set a bandwidth limit for the guest network so that despite heavy or unusual traffic, the internet speed for the employees are not affected.\nSet up Internet Filters – Another alternative is to block certain websites on your network that consume a lot of data and cause a distraction for your employees. For example, employees in your office network might be wasting too much time watching YouTube videos or scrolling through social media. This not only reduces the available bandwidth for other users but also reduces productivity. Using your router admin settings, you can easily block multiple websites on your network. You can also apply internet filters and review security settings to prevent outsiders from gaining access to your network or stealing your data.\nRecommended: Fix Android Connected To WiFi But No Internet\nWe hope that you find this information useful and you were able to limit the internet speed of other WiFi users.

You probably wouldn’t want to make a mistake as it might unnecessarily penalize the wrong person.</p><p>If you have the correct MAC address, then you can easily set the upper limit for the bandwidth and in turn, the internet speed that the person will be entitled to. You can set restrictions for multiple users or probably all users except you.</p><h3 id=what-are-the-pre-requisites-to-limit-internet-speed-or-bandwidth-of-a-wifi>What are the pre-requisites to Limit Internet Speed or Bandwidth of a WiFi?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-are-the-pre-requisites-to-limit-internet-speed-or-bandwidth-of-a-wifi>#</a></h3><p>Before we begin with the process, you need certain important information to access the admin settings of a router. To limit the internet speed for other users, you need to set a new rule for the router. To do so, you need to open the device’s firmware and go to its Advanced settings. Here is a list of information that you need to acquire before that:</p><ol><li><p>The first thing that you need is the IP address of the Router. This is usually written down at the bottom of the router. Depending on the brand and model of your router, it could be either be on a sticker pasted at the bottom or engraved at the sides. 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.0.1 are some of the most common IP addresses for routers.</p></li><li><p>The next thing that you need is the Username and Password. This, too, can be found on the bottom of the router.</p></li><li><p>If it is not there, then you can search for it online. Google the brand and model of your router and find out its IP address, username, and password.</p></li></ol><h4 id=how-to-limit-internet-speed-in-tp-link-router>How to Limit Internet Speed in TP-Link router?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-limit-internet-speed-in-tp-link-router>#</a></h4><ol><li><p>The first thing that you need to do is open your browser and enter the IP address for TP-Link’s firmware.</p></li><li><p>Now fill in the Username and Password in the required fields and log in to your account. Now, most people do not change the default password, and in that case, the password should be ‘admin’ in lower case.</p></li><li><p>After that, tap on the Advanced Routing option, and under that select the Control Settings option.</p></li><li><p>This will open the Bandwidth Control Settings.</p></li><li><p>Here, go to the Rules List section and click on the ‘Add New’ option.</p></li><li><p>Now you need to add the IP address of the device that you need to limit internet speed on.</p></li><li><p>In the Egress Bandwidth section, enter the values for minimum and maximum bandwidth that will be available for upload.</p></li><li><p>In Ingress, the Bandwidth section enters the values for minimum and maximum bandwidth that will be available for download.</p></li><li><p>After that, click on the Save button.</p></li><li><p>That’s it, the internet speed and bandwidth will be restricted for the device whose IP address you entered.

Given below is a list of measures that you can take to avoid others from overusing your internet connection.</p><p>1.Set Active Hours – You can limit the availability of internet access to certain fixed hours in a day and for certain days in a week. For example, you can restrict internet access on your office WiFi network to office hours and weekdays only. This will prevent employees from misusing the data.</p><ol start=2><li><p>Set up Guest Access – Instead of giving out the actual password for your WiFi network, you can set up Guest Access. This allows internet access to people for a short duration of time, for example, you own a café or restaurant, then it more sensible to grant customers temporary guest access for the duration of which they are in your establishment. A guest network is a separate network, and this does not affect the internet speed of employees. You can easily set a bandwidth limit for the guest network so that despite heavy or unusual traffic, the internet speed for the employees are not affected.</p></li><li><p>Set up Internet Filters – Another alternative is to block certain websites on your network that consume a lot of data and cause a distraction for your employees. For example, employees in your office network might be wasting too much time watching YouTube videos or scrolling through social media. This not only reduces the available bandwidth for other users but also reduces productivity. Using your router admin settings, you can easily block multiple websites on your network. You can also apply internet filters and review security settings to prevent outsiders from gaining access to your network or stealing your data.</p></li></ol><p>Recommended: Fix Android Connected To WiFi But No Internet</p><p>We hope that you find this information useful and you were able to limit the internet speed of other WiFi users. We have specifically mentioned certain popular router brands, but you may be using some other model or brand that has not been covered in this article. In that case, you will be glad to know that the process to limit Internet speed or Bandwidth of WiFi is more or less the same for every router. The only thing that you need to find out is the IP address of your router’s firmware. This information will easily be available on the internet, or you could call your network service provider and ask them.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-save-webpages-in-pdf-format-in-ios-16669853/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>You won't believe how easy it is to save webpages in PDF on iOS 16 - Here's how!</span></a>
