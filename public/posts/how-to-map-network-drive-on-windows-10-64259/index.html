Windows 10 is the most popular operating system in the world, and its users are constantly discovering new ways to make the most of its powerful features. One such feature is the ability to map a network drive, which allows you to access files and folders stored on other computers or servers on your network. Mapping a network drive is an essential skill for anyone working in a business or home setting, where files and data need to be shared across devices. In this article, we will show you how to map your network drive in seconds!\nWhat is a network drive? First, let us understand what a network drive is. A network drive is a storage device that is connected to your network, and which can be accessed by multiple computers or devices. By mapping your network drive, you are essentially connecting your computer to the network drive, so that you can access the files and folders stored on it.\nHow to map your network drive Mapping a network drive in Windows 10 is a quick and easy process. Here are the steps to follow:\nStep 1: Open File Explorer To open File Explorer, press the Windows key and E on your keyboard, or click on the File Explorer icon in your taskbar.\nStep 2: Click on “This PC” In the left pane of File Explorer, you will see a list of folders and devices. Click on “This PC” to see an overview of your computer’s storage devices.\nStep 3: Click on “Map network drive” In this window, you will see a “Map network drive” button in the toolbar at the top of the window. Click on it.\nStep 4: Choose a drive letter Choose a drive letter from the drop-down menu. This drive letter will be used to access your network drive in Windows. You can choose any available letter.\nStep 5: Type in the network path In the “Folder” field, type in the network path to your network drive. This path will start with either “\\” or “smb://”, depending on the type of network drive you are connecting to. You will need to check with your network administrator to get the correct path.\nStep 6: Connect using different credentials If you need to connect to the network drive using different credentials, click on the “Connect using different credentials” checkbox. You will be prompted to enter your network username and password.\nStep 7: Click “Finish” Once you have entered all the required information, click on the “Finish” button. Windows will now connect to your network drive and create a shortcut to it on your computer.\nConclusion Mapping a network drive in Windows 10 is a simple and powerful tool that can help you access files and folders stored on other computers or servers on your network. By following the simple steps outlined in this article, you can quickly and easily map your network drive, unlock the full power of Windows 10, and take your productivity to the next level.\nTo map network drive on Windows 10, open File Explorer \u003e This PC and click “Map network drive.” Then select the drive letter for the mapping, confirm the network path for the drive, and click Finish to complete the mapping on Windows 10. Alternatively, on Command Prompt (non-admin), use the “net use \\SERVER\\FOLDERPATH” command to map a network drive. Or, on PowerShell, use the “New-PSDrive -Name “LETTER” -PSProvider “FileSystem” -Root “\\SERVER\\FOLDERPATH” -Persist” command to map a drive on Windows 10. On Windows 10, you can map a network drive to quickly access files stored in a shared folder on another computer (or server) connected to the network.\nWhen you connect to a drive using the “Map Network Drive” option on Windows 10, the system essentially creates a “shortcut” that points to the network shared folder with a drive letter and access credentials. The mapped drive then appears on “This PC” under the “Network locations” section to give you quick access to those files stored on the remote computer.\nThis guide will teach you how to map a network drive on Windows 10. In addition, you’ll learn how to disconnect it using the options available in File Explorer, Command Prompt, and PowerShell.\nMap network drive on Windows 10 Disconnect mapped drive on Windows 10 Map network drive on Windows 10 On Windows 11, you can map a network drive in at least three ways using the File Explorer wizard and commands with Command Prompt and PowerShell.\nNetwork drive map from File Explorer To map a network drive on Windows 10 from File Explorer, use these steps:\nOpen File Explorer on Windows 10. Click on This PC from the left pane. Click the “Map network drive” option from the “Computer” tab. Use the “Drive” drop-down menu and select an unused letter to assign the drive. (Or you can use the default selection.) In the “Folder” field, enter the network path to the shared folder. (Or click the Browse button to browse to the folder to map as a network drive, and click the OK button.) Check the “Reconnect at sign-in” option to connect to the network location permanently. Check the “Connect using different credentials” option if the credentials are different from the account you are already using to sign in to Windows 10. Click the Finish button. Confirm the network account credentials (if applicable). Click the OK button. Once you complete the steps, the drive will map and become available in File Explorer.\nOpen File Explorer on Windows 10.\nClick on This PC from the left pane.\nClick the “Map network drive” option from the “Computer” tab.\nUse the “Drive” drop-down menu and select an unused letter to assign the drive. (Or you can use the default selection.)\nIn the “Folder” field, enter the network path to the shared folder. (Or click the Browse button to browse to the folder to map as a network drive, and click the OK button.)\nCheck the “Reconnect at sign-in” option to connect to the network location permanently.\nCheck the “Connect using different credentials” option if the credentials are different from the account you are already using to sign in to Windows 10.\nClick the Finish button.\nConfirm the network account credentials (if applicable).\nClick the OK button.\nIf you cannot connect to the shared folder, use the IP address instead of the computer name. However, if the remote computer uses a dynamic IP address configuration, it may change in the future, and you may need to reconnect again.\nNetwork drive map from Command Prompt To map a network drive from Command Prompt on Windows 10, use these steps:\nOpen Start. Search for Command Prompt and click the top result to open the console. Quick note: If you run the command as an administrator, the drive may not mount correctly and won’t appear in File Explorer. As a result, run the command as a standard user. Type the following command to map a drive assigning drive letter manually and press Enter: net use Z: \\DEVICE-NAME-OR-IP\\SHARED-FOLDER In the command, replace “Z” with the drive letter not already in use you want to use. Then replace DEVICE-NAME-OR-IP and SHARED-FOLDER for the computer name or IP address of the device hosting the shared folder and the name of the shared. For example, this command maps the ShareOne folder to the computer with the “Z” drive letter: net use Z: \\vm-beta\\ShareOne Type the following command to map a drive assigning drive letter automatically and press Enter: net use * \\DEVICE-NAME-OR-IP\\SHARED-FOLDER In the command, the (*) is the option that allows the system to assign any drive letter that is not already in use. Then replace DEVICE-NAME-OR-IP and SHARED-FOLDER for the computer name or IP address of the device hosting the shared folder and the name of the shared. For example, this command maps the ShareOne folder to the computer: net use * \\vm-beta\\ShareOne Type the following command to map a drive providing authentication details and press Enter: net use Z: \\DEVICE-NAME-OR-IP\\SHARED-FOLDER PASSWORD /user:USERNAME /persistent:yes In the command, replace “Z” with the drive letter not already in use you want to use. Then change DEVICE-NAME-OR-IP and SHARED-FOLDER for the computer name or IP address of the device hosting the shared folder and the name of the shared. The PASSWORD and USERNAME have to be replaced with the credentials to authenticate with the remote machine. The “persistent” option allows the folder to stay mapped after reboot. For example, this command maps the ShareOne folder providing the user credentials and making the mapping persistent: net use Z: \\vm-beta\\ShareOne password /user:admin /persistent:yes Once you complete the steps, the network-shared folder will map on the device and appear in File Explorer.\nOpen Start.\nSearch for Command Prompt and click the top result to open the console.\nType the following command to map a drive assigning drive letter manually and press Enter:\nnet use Z: \\DEVICE-NAME-OR-IP\\SHARED-FOLDER\nIn the command, replace “Z” with the drive letter not already in use you want to use. Then replace DEVICE-NAME-OR-IP and SHARED-FOLDER for the computer name or IP address of the device hosting the shared folder and the name of the shared. For example, this command maps the ShareOne folder to the computer with the “Z” drive letter:\nnet use Z: \\vm-beta\\ShareOne\nType the following command to map a drive assigning drive letter automatically and press Enter:\nnet use * \\DEVICE-NAME-OR-IP\\SHARED-FOLDER\nIn the command, the (*) is the option that allows the system to assign any drive letter that is not already in use.
