It holds all your important data, memories and personal information. However, computers are prone to failure, viruses, or malware attacks that can result in valuable information loss. That’s why it is crucial to backup your PC regularly.\nMost people ignore this step because they either think it’s too complicated or don’t have enough time. But worry not, with Windows 10, creating a full backup is a straightforward process that can be done in just a few steps. In this article, we’ll show you how to create a full backup, so you never have to worry about losing your valuable data.\nStep 1: Find the backup feature\nWindows 10 provides an in-built backup feature that allows you to create a system image, which is a complete copy of your computer’s operating system, applications, settings, and files. To access this feature, search for “backup settings” in the Windows search box or navigate to Control Panel \u003e System and Security \u003e Backup and Restore (Windows 7).\nStep 2: Choose a backup drive\nAfter opening the Backup and Restore feature, click on “Set up backup” to begin the process. Windows will prompt you to choose a location to save the backup. You can choose an external hard drive, USB drive, network location, or DVDs. Ensure the destination drive has enough space to store the full backup.\nStep 3: Select what to back up\nWindows gives you two options to customize what to backup: Let Windows choose or Let me choose. If you choose “Let Windows choose,” Windows will back up files designated for the operating system and all files stored in libraries, including documents, music, pictures, and videos. Choosing “Let me choose” allows you to select specific files, folders and drives that should be backed up. You can also configure how frequently Windows should back up your files.\nStep 4: Begin the backup process\nOnce you’ve made your selections, click on “Save settings and run backup” to start the backup process. Windows will create a full backup of your files, operating system, and settings, which can take up to several hours to complete. You can continue to work on your computer while the backup is running in the background.\nStep 5: Restore from backup\nIf anything goes wrong with your computer, you can quickly restore it using the system image you’ve created. To do that, go to Backup and Restore (Windows 7) and click on “Restore my files” or “Restore all users’ files.” Windows will guide you through the process of restoring your files from the system image you’ve created.\nConclusion:\nCreating a full backup of your computer is a crucial step in safeguarding your data, which should be done regularly. With Windows 10, this process is made easy and straightforward.
