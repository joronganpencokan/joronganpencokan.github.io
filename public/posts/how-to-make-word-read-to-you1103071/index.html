Installing a third-party TTS software is simple and usually requires only a few clicks.\nHeading 3: Using Google Docs\nIf you use Google Docs, you can also take advantage of its built-in TTS feature. To use this feature, select the text you want to hear and then highlight it. Once it’s selected, click on the “Tools” option in the top menu, and then select “Accessibility.” Finally, select “Speak” from the drop-down menu. Google Docs will then start reading the text to you.\nHeading 4: Using Web Browsers\nMost web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, have built-in TTS capabilities. To use this feature, highlight the text you want to hear, right-click, and select the “Speak” option. If this feature is not available, you can download a browser extension like SpeakIt for Google Chrome or Speak for Firefox.\nConclusion:\nOverall, having your computer read to you is an easy and efficient way to save time and reduce the strain on your eyes. There are many TTS software options available, and most are easy to download and install. You can also make use of built-in TTS features in programs like Google Docs and web browsers.

Here’s how to make Word read to you.\nWhat to Know\nSelect the Read Aloud icon in the ribbon under the Review menu to hear the entire document narrated.Add the Speak command to the Quick Look Toolbar and select the Speak icon to narrate the text you’ve highlighted in your document.Read Aloud sounds better but is only available in versions of Office after 2019. The Speak feature is available in Office 2003 and later. How to Make Word Read to You From within Microsoft Word, there are two main features to make Word read to you. The first is Read Aloud, which will read the entire page. The second is Speak, which will read aloud only the text you’ve selected.\nHow to Use Read Aloud in Word You can only use the Read Aloud feature in Word if you have Office 2019, Office 2021, or Microsoft 365.

You’ll want to first open the document you’d like Microsoft Word to read aloud to you. Without a document open, the Read Aloud controls won’t do anything. This option will open the Read Aloud controls at the upper right corner of your open document. There are five buttons to control the Read Aloud feature. To hear the text read aloud to you, press the Play icon in these controls (the right arrow icon). You’ll hear a voice reading the text aloud.
