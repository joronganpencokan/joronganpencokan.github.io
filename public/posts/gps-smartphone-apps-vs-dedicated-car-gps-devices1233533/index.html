With the advent of GPS-enabled smartphones and dedicated car GPS devices, people have been able to travel more efficiently and safely than ever before. But which of these two options is better for getting around? A recent study has revealed some surprising results.\nThe Study\nThe research, conducted by the American Automobile Association (AAA), tested three types of navigation systems - the smartphone app, the dedicated car GPS device, and an in-car infotainment system. The study was conducted using a 4,000-mile road trip on both urban and rural roads. The researchers evaluated how quickly each system directed the driver to the correct destination, how clearly the directions were presented, and how accurate the time of arrival predictions were.\nThe Results\nThe study revealed that all three types of systems were accurate and reliable on average. However, there were some notable differences between them.\nThe smartphone app, surprisingly, was found to be more efficient than the dedicated car GPS device. The app proved to be faster in recalculating routes and presenting alternative routes when there were obstacles or traffic. It also received high marks for clarity, with easy-to-understand directions and clear graphics.\nThe dedicated car GPS device, on the other hand, was found to be less efficient in recalculating routes, and less likely to present alternative routes when obstructed or congested. However, it scored highly for accuracy in its initial directions, and in presenting accurate arrival times.\nThe in-car infotainment system had mixed reviews - while it was able to integrate well with other systems in the car like music, phone calls, and climate control, it was found to be the least efficient in terms of navigation, with slow recalculating times and unclear directions.\nOverall, the smartphone app came out on top in this study, with the dedicated car GPS device coming in second, and the in-car infotainment system lagging behind in third place.\nConclusion\nThe results of this study offer valuable insights into the world of navigation technology. While traditionalists may argue that dedicated car GPS devices are superior, the findings suggest that smartphone apps may actually be the better choice. This is particularly true for those who frequently travel in urban areas, where traffic is more of an issue. However, it is important to note that not all smartphone apps are equal - some may be less reliable than others, and some may have less user-friendly interfaces.\nIn conclusion, when choosing a navigation system, it is important to consider your individual needs and preferences. If you are looking for efficiency and flexibility, a smartphone app may be the way to go. If you prioritize initial accuracy and clear directions, a dedicated car GPS device may be more your speed. Whichever you choose, using a navigation system will no doubt help you travel more safely and efficiently.\nGPS navigation has grown into a robust product category with many options. App stores offer a variety of smartphone navigation apps, and manufacturers such as Garmin and TomTom sell dedicated GPS devices. We examined each type of technology to help you decide between the two.\nOverall Findings Both dedicated GPS personal navigation devices (PNDs) and smartphone navigation apps offer high-quality, accurate maps and directions. PNDs offer larger screens and dedicated mounts. On the other hand, because smartphones are always connected to the internet and have capacitive touchscreens, you might prefer their ease and flexibility.\nThe car GPS systems discussed here are not to be confused with factory-installed systems, such as OnStar, that offer advanced features such as automatic crash response and vehicle diagnostics.\nClear, sharp displays.\nSmall fonts and menus are hard to use in a car.\nVoice directions offer clear guidance.\nLarge smartphones are good for dash mounting.\nQuality and functionality of mounts varies.\nAlways updated with the latest maps.\nAlways connected to a cellular network.\nDrains battery and uses mobile data.\nUsually free.\nLarge resistive touchscreens.\nMenus and controls optimized for arm’s-length viewing.\nMore information on the display.\nCome with windshield mounts and power port chargers.\nMounts are adjustable and adaptable.\nAccess to high-quality maps and databases.\nRequires a monthly fee to maintain connectivity.\nCan be expensive.\nSome top navigation apps include Waze, Google Maps, and Apple Maps. Well-known PND manufacturers include Garmin and TomTom.\nUser Interface: Bigger Might Be Better A smartphone offers a sharp, clear display with a capacitive touchscreen. It functions well when held in the hand, but it’s harder to see and use any farther away.\nSmartphone apps such as Waze, Google Maps, and Apple Maps are free to download. Dedicated car GPS systems cost from $100 to several hundred dollars or more.\nClear displays and touch functionality.\nSmall displays are hard to use in a car.\nNot optimized for arm’s-length viewing.\nLarge displays designed for arm’s-length viewing.\nScreens include more information.\nSimple and durable.\nMost GPS turn-by-turn navigation apps have tried to adapt to car-mounted use with larger fonts and buttons. However, these are still smaller than those found on a typical dedicated GPS device.\nPNDs have resistive touchscreens that are typically 4.3 inches or 5.5 inches diagonally. Larger-screen PNDs with 5-inch screens are becoming more common. PND menu systems, touchscreen keyboards, display letters, and numerals have been optimized for arm’s-length viewing and tuned for usability while driving.\nThe simplicity, durability, and larger size of the dedicated GPS PND resistive touchscreen wins out in this comparison, and this is one of the biggest factors to consider in the smartphone vs. PND choice.\nWindshield and Dash Mounting: PNDs Have the Edge Many use their smartphone’s turn-by-turn navigation while the phone rests on the passenger seat or some other flat area, or they listen to the directions. A windshield or dash mount provides safer, easier viewing for turn-by-turn directions.\nPND displays have room to include more information about the distance to upcoming turns, upcoming street names, speed limit information, time-of-arrival information, and more.\nWindshield mounts can be costly.\nSome mounts don’t allow for phone charging.\nMounts come with the unit.\nMounts have chargers and other features.\nSmartphone windshield mounts range from simple, one-size-fits-all holders with no charger ports or additional features to sophisticated units with chargers, speakers, supplemental GPS chips, microphones, and more. A smartphone windshield mount can be costly, so factor that into your decision. Also, make sure the mount includes a charger or that you have an accessory power port charger for your smartphone.\nDedicated PNDs include windshield mounts and power port chargers. Mounts from the major manufacturers are well-built, adjustable, and adaptable to various mounting points using included sticky-backed disks. PND mounts come right in the box, so PNDs have the edge in mounting.\nQuality of Maps and Directions: Equally Accurate Smartphone map and points-of-interest databases are downloaded initially with the purchase of the app, as with TomTom for iPhone, or are downloaded on the fly. When you download maps on the fly, you always have the latest version. The downside is that you can be without maps in remote areas out of a cellphone tower range. If you do a lot of rural driving, stick with onboard maps.\nThird-party alternative mounts for GPS devices offer more functionality and features.\nUse high-quality maps and databases.\nAccurate directions.\nMap sets are onboard or downloaded on the fly.\nUse high-quality maps and databases.\nAccurate directions.\nMap sets are onboard.\nSmartphone turn-by-turn apps generally use the same high-quality maps and databases provided by mapping giants TeleNav and NavTeq, as do the PND manufacturers. Google has gone its own way with Google Maps. Name-brand smartphone turn-by-turn apps and PNDs offer equally good experiences.\nPNDs keep map sets on board. Most makers offer free map updates periodically.\nConnectivity: Smartphone Connectivity Gets the Edge Smartphones have the advantage of always being connected to the cellular network and the internet. Some smartphone GPS navigation apps take advantage of this connectivity with sophisticated search, real-time traffic detection and avoidance, and gas prices, while others make scant use of the internet. Check out the app’s connectivity features before you download it.\nSophisticated connectivity features.\nExcellent web browsers.\nMay or may not include network connectivity.\nMinimal-function or no browser.\nDedicated PNDs may or may not include cellular network and internet connectivity. Check the specifications, and look into whether you’ll need to pay a monthly fee to maintain connectivity in a PND.\nSmartphones generally have excellent web browsers; PNDs have minimal-function browsers or none at all.\nFinal Verdict There’s a lot to consider in the smartphone navigation vs. PND debate, but the good news is that you have many excellent products to consider in both categories. Think about ease of use, how often you’ll use navigation, and where you travel. If you generally listen to voice directions and don’t need to access navigation while driving, an app is fine.\nThough smartphone connectivity gets the edge, using a PND protects cellphone battery life.\nIf you’re concerned about battery drain, mobile data usage, small smartphone screens, and mounting problems, a dedicated car GPS service might be the right choice.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1530","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ryan Bliss"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/gps-smartphone-apps-vs-dedicated-car-gps-devices1233533/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't believe what this study found about GPS smartphone apps vs dedicated car GPS devices!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 8, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1530 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Ryan Bliss</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#overall-findings>Overall Findings</a></li><li><a href=#user-interface-bigger-might-be-better>User Interface: Bigger Might Be Better</a></li><li><a href=#windshield-and-dash-mounting-pnds-have-the-edge>Windshield and Dash Mounting: PNDs Have the Edge</a></li><li><a href=#quality-of-maps-and-directions-equally-accurate>Quality of Maps and Directions: Equally Accurate</a></li><li><a href=#connectivity-smartphone-connectivity-gets-the-edge>Connectivity: Smartphone Connectivity Gets the Edge</a></li><li><a href=#final-verdict>Final Verdict</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Title: You Won&rsquo;t Believe What This Study Found About GPS Smartphone Apps vs Dedicated Car GPS Devices!</p><p>GPS technology has been a real game-changer in the world of travel and navigation.
