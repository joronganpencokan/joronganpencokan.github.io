But with the constant influx of emails received daily, it can quickly become overwhelming and chaotic, leaving us feeling frustrated and stressed. Fortunately, there is a solution – Google Inbox.\nGoogle Inbox is an app created by Google that completely revolutionizes the way we approach email. With its advanced features and simple interface, users can easily manage their emails and stay organized, making email communication a breeze. Here are some tips on how you can transform your Gmail into a Google Inbox masterpiece.\nSnooze Your Emails\nOne of the best features of Google Inbox is the ability to snooze your emails. Instead of letting the never-ending stream of new emails in your inbox pile up and distract you, simply snooze them. This feature lets you set a reminder to come back to the email at a later time or date that is more convenient for you. You can even choose a pre-set snooze time such as “Later Today” or “Tomorrow Morning.”\nUse Bundles\nBundles is another fantastic feature of Google Inbox. It groups your emails together based on their content, making it easier to manage and prioritize them. For example, you can create a bundle called “Travel” and all emails related to travel plans will automatically be organized under this bundle. You can choose to archive or delete an entire bundle or individual emails.\nPin Important Emails\nNo more sifting through your email history to find critical messages. With Google Inbox, you can “pin” your most important emails for easy access. This feature ensures that they remain at the top of your inbox for immediate attention. You can pin multiple emails and unpin them with a single click.\nCreate Reminders\nGoogle Inbox makes it easy to stay on top of your to-do list by allowing you to create reminders in the same place where you receive your emails. Simply click on the reminder icon, set a date or time, and type in a brief description. You can also add a location to your reminder and receive a notification when you are near that location.\nSmart Reply\nLastly, Smart Reply, a feature unique to Google Inbox, uses artificial intelligence to suggest short responses to your emails. The suggestions are based on the content of your email, and you can select one with a single click. Smart Reply saves time and effort, especially when responding to simple or routine emails.\nGoogle Inbox is a powerful tool that can help streamline and organize your email communication. With these tips, you can quickly master the app, allowing you to spend less time managing your inbox and more time doing the things you love. So why wait? Start revolutionizing your email experience today!\nOn April 2, 2019, Google ceased support of Inbox for Gmail. If you don’t know what it is, Google developed it as an experimental Gmail with some great features. It acted as a testing ground to see what people wanted from their email clients. Inbox worked well, offering people a new way to interact with Gmail and get some new features put into the main Gmail client.\nInbox worked so well, in fact, that a lot of features (but not all) were eventually put into Gmail, after which the appeal of Inbox for Gmail waned for Google. In September 2018 Google announced they were shutting it down, with the actual closure happening in April. Despite being an experimental Gmail, people missed Inbox for Gmail, as it had a clean UI and had some features not yet put into the main Gmail branch.\nWhile you can’t get Inbox back as it was, you can still turn your regular Gmail into an Inbox simulacrum that tries to replicate the base Inbox experience as closely as possible.\nHow to Get Your Gmail to Look Like Inbox The best way to do this is to install the Inbox Theme for Gmail extension. Unfortunately, it’s not a silver bullet solution, as it only supports Chrome at the moment and is only an aesthetic update. It doesn’t replicate the lost features from Inbox, just makes it look like it. However, at the time of writing, it’s honestly the best way you can get regular Gmail to look like Inbox.\nAs you can see from the movie on the main page, it does a good job of recapturing the look and feel of Inbox. It’s also very easy to install; just grab it like a regular extension, then reload Gmail to see the change instantly. Hopefully, as time goes on, we’ll see more of Inbox’s missing features implemented via extensions.\nA Similar Alternative While you’re in the market for a more Inbox-styled Gmail, why not take a peek at what a past Inbox developer worked on?\nComputerWorld has a nice heads-up to an extension that works similarly to Inbox, but isn’t trying to replicate it. It’s called Simplify Gmail, and it does a similar job to Inbox Theme for Gmail while also doing its own thing. It’s worth a look if you’re after a simple Gmail interface instead of a replica of Inbox.\nWhat About the Features? Unfortunately, for now Inbox features such as the Bundles don’t seem to have an addon to add it back in. It’s best to think about the kind of features you liked in Inbox and try to replicate them in Gmail somehow. If you really can’t, consider shopping around for a new mail provider that offers a similar, if not identical, feature to the one you want.\nGetting in with Inbox While Inbox for Gmail is no longer, you can edit your regular Gmail to look more like Inbox. It’s not perfect, and it’s missing a lot of the neat features that came with Inbox, but it’s perfect for those who liked the more simplistic look.\nWhat feature of Inbox do you miss most in Gmail?
