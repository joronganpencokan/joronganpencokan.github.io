Have you ever accidentally deleted an important email from your Gmail inbox and never been able to retrieve it? It can be a frustrating experience, especially if the email contained vital information or data. But what if I told you there’s a way to recover those permanently deleted Gmail messages?\nYes, it’s a startling fact that Gmail stores permanently deleted messages in their backup system for some time. These backups can date back to several months or maybe even years, depending on the individual’s Gmail usage. In this article, we’ll guide you through the surprising method of recovering those deleted Gmail messages.\nThe Basics of Recovering Permanently Deleted Gmail Messages First things first, let’s start with the basics of retrieving those lost Gmail messages. Whenever a user deletes an email from their inbox, Gmail does not immediately remove it from their servers. Instead, it moves the email to Trash, where it stays for 30 days (or until the user decides to empty their Trash folder).\nBut what happens when you empty your Trash folder? Does Gmail remove the messages from their servers permanently? Not yet. Gmail keeps a backup of all deleted emails as an additional safety measure. These backup files are created periodically and updated regularly by Gmail. So when you delete an email permanently, it is not actually gone forever.\nHow to Recover Permanently Deleted Gmail Messages Now that we know the basics, let’s move on to the method you can use to recover lost Gmail messages. Here are the steps that you can follow:\nVisit the official Gmail page and sign in to your account.\nAfter signing in successfully, click on the drop-down icon on the left side of the screen.\nSelect the “All Mail” option.\nIn the search bar, type in a keyword or phrase that you remember from the email you want to retrieve. You can also use advanced search methods such as a specific sender or recipient, a date range, or a specific label. We recommend using the advanced search method as it will help you find the email more efficiently.\nOnce you have entered all the required details, click on the “Search” button. Gmail will show you all the emails that match your search criteria.\nIf you can’t find the email you’re looking for, try using different combinations of keywords, dates, or the advanced search feature.\nOnce you have located the email, select it by clicking on the checkbox next to it.\nClick on the “Move to Inbox” button. This will transfer the email from the All Mail folder back to your inbox.\nThat’s it! You have successfully recovered a permanently deleted email from Gmail.\nConclusion In conclusion, Gmail makes it easier for users to retrieve permanently deleted emails by keeping regular backups. Although this isn’t a guaranteed method, it is still a viable option for recovering lost emails that contain vital information. So, the next time you accidentally delete an essential message, don’t panic. Instead, use the surprising method above, and you’ll never lose another email again!\nSince Google knows users can face such situations, they have introduced a Gmail Message Recovery Tool. The tool has been around for a while, but only a few users know about it. Gmail’s Message Recovery Tools allows you to recover emails that were deleted within the last 30 days. According to Google, the tool can recover emails that might have been deleted due to someone accessing your account without permission. For that, you need to confirm your account information and follow a few security steps to recover the deleted emails. Also Read: How To Get Gmail Notifications Directly On Your PC\nSteps to Recover Permanently Deleted Emails in Gmail In this article, we will share a detailed guide on how to recover deleted emails in Gmail. Let’s check out. Note: We have tested this method with multiple accounts. In a few accounts, the recovery tool shows an error message reading, “Unfortunately, your missing emails were permanently deleted”. If you get this error, there’s no way to get back the emails. Step 1. First of all, open the Google Chrome web browser. You can use other web browsers as well, but Google Chrome is recommended. Step 2. Now open the Gmail Message Recovery Tool page. Simply sign in with the Gmail account whose emails you want to recover.\nStep 3. Now you will be asked to confirm your account information. Click on the ‘Continue’ button.\nStep 4. In the next step, you will be asked to change the Account password. Complete the security steps and click on ‘Continue’\nStep 5. Now, wait for a few minutes. If the recovery tool can recover the messages, it will show you the success message. If it fails to fetch the deleted emails, you will get an error.\nStep 6. After getting a success message, you will find the missing emails within the next 24 hours on the ‘All Mail’ tab.\nThat’s it! You are done. This is how you can recover permanently deleted emails in Gmail. So, this article is all about how to recover permanently deleted emails in Gmail. I hope this article helped you!
