In Hearthstone, you face another player in a turn-based battle with a deck of 30 cards. Each of these cards has unique abilities \u0026 powers. Some cards are very powerful and are the center of their decks while other cards are used to support those cards. There are different types of Decks in Hearthstone and each can be customized to fit the Players’ playstyle. The META around these Decks of Hearthstone changes every so often. So in today’s guide, I will show you the best Hearthstone Deck Tier List.\nHearthstone Deck Tier List Currently, a few decks are popular, and here is the Hearthstone Tier List.\nAs we can see in the Hearthstone Tier List, S-Tier has the Best decks in Hearthstone at the moment where each of them has over 55% Winrate with Quest Warrior having a 59.08% win rate. The A-Tier in the List consists of great Decks in Hearthstone so you can’t go wrong in picking them. The B-Tier in the List consists of decent Decks in Hearthstone. They are not the best nor the worst. C-Tier consists of the Worst Decks possible aside from random and bad decks.\nWhat are the Types of Decks? Like other online digital collectible card games, there are a few types of Decks that each deck in Hearthstone will come under. Those are Aggro Decks, Midrange Decks, \u0026 Control Decks.

Usually, these decks are cheap and they are meant to overwhelm the enemy Strats. If done correctly, you can win a game in a relatively short time. Control Decks: They are the complete opposite of Aggro decks. Control Decks are slow-paced consisting of heavy Mana cards and a lot of Spells and Effect Cards to deny and counter the enemy’s gameplan. Midrange Decks: These Decks fall somewhere in between the first two types. They are not that fast but are not the slowest either. It is perfect for Dust Management and gaining control of the Board.
