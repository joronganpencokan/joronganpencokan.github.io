Now you must have known that you cannot login to Flickr with username.</p><h3 id=can-i-use-flickr-with-gmail>Can I Use Flickr with Gmail?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#can-i-use-flickr-with-gmail>#</a></h3><p>Yes, you can use Flickr with Gmail as well. Originally, at the beginning of Flickr, it was necessary for a user to have a Yahoo account in order to sign into a Flickr account. But due to decreasing Yahoo users and rising Gmail users, Flickr made changes to their service and allowed users to sign up with any email address, which can be either Yahoo, Gmail, or any other. Hence you no longer requires Yahoo to sign into Flickr.</p><h3 id=can-i-login-to-flickr-with-gmail>Can I Login to Flickr with Gmail?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#can-i-login-to-flickr-with-gmail>#</a></h3><p>Yes, you can login to Flickr with Gmail. To log into Flickr using Gmail, you need to create a Flickr account using your Gmail account, and you need to verify your Flickr account. Once you have verified your Flickr account using your Gmail account, you will be able to log into Flickr using your Gmail and will also be able to use Flickr with a Gmail account. A few years back, somewhere around 2018, Flickr was only accepting yahoo users to join Flickr. But after the Flickr change of Flickr’s ownership, it became easy for users to join Flickr using any email address they wanted. You must have got clear that whether if can you login to Flickr with Gmail or not.</p><p>Recommended:</p><ul><li>12 Best Face Merge Online Apps for iOS</li><li>How to Change Username and Name on Clubhouse Android App</li><li>Why is TikTok Making Me Sign Up?</li><li>How Do I Log Into Hulu With My Spotify Account</li></ul><p>We hope that you learned about how to log into Flickr with Yahoo account.
