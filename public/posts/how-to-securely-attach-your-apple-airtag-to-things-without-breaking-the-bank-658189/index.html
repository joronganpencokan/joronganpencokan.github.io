So, unlock the secret to affordable AirTag attachments and keep your belongings safe and secure!\nJust this morning, I used an AirTag to track down my keys. Keys which turned out to be in my pocket But how do you attach the petite white flying saucer to your keys? Also: How to hide an Apple AirTag on your bike (and why you should) Apple’s suggestion is that you use one of its AirTag holders. Perhaps the $35 leather key ring tag, or a $29 silicone loop, or maybe you want to treat yourself to a $349 Hermès key ring holder. I don’t know about you, but I’m reluctant to pay $35 for a holder for an AirTag that costs $29. I’ve dabbled with cheap – and I mean like $2 cheap – silicone AirTag holders, but they’ve let me down in that the AirTag can pop out, and the silicone starts to tear after a few weeks of use. I don’t recommend these. Buy cheap, buy twice. I’ve been testing a few different holders and have found some that are both good quality and reasonably priced. The Unbreakcable Nu Series protective AirTag case is one of them. This AirTag case is made from highly durable TPU, and features a clear protective front cover to improve protection and prevent the AirTag from rattling about. And to make it easy to attach your AirTag to things – keys, luggage, pets – there’s a sturdy metal clip. Made of an aluminum alloy, this clip is lightweight yet strong and corrosion resistant. The case doesn’t reduce the range that the AirTag can be detected and has very little effect on the beeps that a lost AirTag emits to help you find it. Unbreakcable also claims that the cases are waterproof to IP56, but given that AirTags have a rating of IP67, the purpose of this seems to be to prevent dirt, dust, and moisture from entering the case. They’re also easy to use. Pop the case out of the pack and remove the clear front cover. Then remove the packing piece that keeps the case from being crushed in transit. Pop the AirTag into the TPU case. It’s quite a tight fit! Finally, pop the cover on, and finish up with the ring! And best of all, priced at $21.99 for a pack of four, the Unbreakcable Nu Series protective AirTag case four-pack costs less than a single AirTag. ","wordCount":"863","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-14T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Vivian Bedell"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-securely-attach-your-apple-airtag-to-things-without-breaking-the-bank-658189/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock the Secret to Affordable Airtag Attachment - Keep Your Belongings Safe & Secure!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 14, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;863 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Vivian Bedell</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=unlock-the-secret-to-affordable-airtag-attachment---keep-your-belongings-safe--secure>Unlock the Secret to Affordable Airtag Attachment - Keep Your Belongings Safe & Secure!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#unlock-the-secret-to-affordable-airtag-attachment---keep-your-belongings-safe--secure>#</a></h1><p>Have you ever lost your keys, wallet, or luggage?
