Are you tired of using the same old wallpapers on your computer or phone? Do you want to create something unique and stunning, but don’t know where to start? Look no further, because in this article we will show you just how easy it is to make your own HD wallpapers using Photoshop.\nStep 1: Choose Your Subject\nFirst, you need to decide what you want your wallpaper to feature. It can be a landscape, a cityscape, a pattern, or anything else that catches your eye. Once you have your subject in mind, find a high-quality image that you can use as a reference.\nStep 2: Crop and Resize\nNext, open your image in Photoshop and crop it to the size you want your wallpaper to be. Keep in mind that different devices have different screen resolutions, so you may need to resize your image accordingly. If you’re not sure what size to use, a quick Google search will give you the dimensions you need.\nStep 3: Adjust Brightness and Contrast\nNow it’s time to make some adjustments to your image. First, go to Image \u003e Adjustments \u003e Brightness/Contrast and tweak the settings until you’re happy with the overall brightness and contrast of your image. This will help make the colors pop and give your wallpaper more depth.\nStep 4: Add Filters and Effects\nIf you want to give your wallpaper a more artistic look, you can add filters and effects to your image. One of our favorites is the “Oil Paint” filter, which can be found under Filter \u003e Stylize \u003e Oil Paint. This gives your image a beautiful painterly effect that is sure to impress.\nStep 5: Add Text and Graphics\nIf you want to add some text or graphics to your wallpaper, now is the time to do it. Use the text tool to add a quote, a message, or anything else that you want to include. You can also add shapes, lines, and other graphics to give your wallpaper a more polished look.\nStep 6: Save and Use Your Wallpaper\nOnce you’re happy with your design, it’s time to save your wallpaper. Go to File \u003e Save As and choose a file format that is compatible with your device. We recommend using either JPEG or PNG for the best quality. Then, simply set your new wallpaper as your desktop or lock screen and enjoy!\nIn conclusion, creating stunning HD wallpapers in Photoshop is easier than you think. With just a few simple steps, you can create a unique and beautiful wallpaper that is sure to impress. So, what are you waiting for? Get creative and start designing your own wallpapers today!\nAdobe Photoshop is by far the best photo editing application known. Apart from normal image editing jobs, you can also use it to create high definition wallpapers for your desktop. In this article I am going to discuss three techniques which you can use in Adobe Photoshop to create high definition wallpapers.\nWe will first create a wallpaper with cloudy colored effects follow by adding a shine effect to it. Lastly, we will wrap it up with a lighting effect.\nOpen Adobe Photoshop. Click on “File -\u003eNew” (Ctrl + N) in the toolbar to open a new blank page.\nA new window will appear. Select 1024×768 as the Preset Sizes. This is required for a high resolution output (You can change to a bigger image size to match your desktop screen resolution, but the minimum should be 1024×768). Under the “Contents” section at the bottom of the window, check the “Background Color” option. Now hit the “OK” button.\nAs soon as you have created a blank page, click on the “Filter” menu and then “Render” option in toolbar. Finally select “Difference Clouds” option to get a cloudy effect of different colors.\nYou will get the wallpaper with cloudy combination of two colors. You can further reset the color combination. Click on the two colors in the left side tool pane and select your favorite colors.\nAdd Sun-Shine effect to the wallpaper Once you have created a cloudy wallpaper, click on “File -\u003e Render” option in toolbar. Now choose the “Lens Flare” option to get effects of Sun-shine.\nA small window will appear. Here is where you can change the sun-shine position. Drag the sun-shine to your desired position. You can also change the brightness of the Sun-shine effect by dragging the brightness cursor. Finally hit the “OK” button to save the change.\nYour editing job is over and it’s the time to save the output. Simply click on “File -\u003eSave As” option in toolbar and save the output in PNG format (PNG provides the best image quality). Look at the final result below:\nAdd Lighting Effects to the wallpaper Click on the “Filter” and then “Render” in the toolbar. Now select the “Lighting Effects” option.\nThe lighting adjustment window will appear. You can see the output preview in the left pane. Now drag the oval shaped cursor in the left pane, attached with the output and set the direction of light source. It’s also possible to change the intensity, focus area etc by clicking on the tools in the right pane of that window. Click on the “Style” at top to get a bunch of different types of lighting effects. Finally hit the “OK” button to apply the changes.\nThat’s all to create high definition wallpapers with Adobe Photoshop. Have you created your own wallpapers?\nAbhishek Palit is the administrator and author of Softtricks.
