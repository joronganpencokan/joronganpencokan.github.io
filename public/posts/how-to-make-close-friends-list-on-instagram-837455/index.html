Because the green-colored outer ring of the story denotes that the person has shared the story or reel with only those who are in the list of close friends on Instagram.</p><h3 id=can-you-join-someones-close-friend-list-on-instagram>Can You Join Someone’s Close Friend List on Instagram?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#can-you-join-someones-close-friend-list-on-instagram>#</a></h3><p>No, you cannot join someone’s close friend list on IG on your own. Insta doesn’t create close friends list; it only provides the users with the feature of Close Friends. It depends on the user who manages his/hers Close friend list. You can create your own close friends list on Instagram, and no one except you can see it or edit it. There are not any criteria to which, if you qualify, you can be on someone’s close friend list. It totally depends on the person who is managing it. Now you may know if can you join someone’s close friend list on IG or not.</p><h3 id=how-to-make-a-close-friends-list-on-instagram-and-add-friends>How to Make a Close Friends List on Instagram and Add Friends?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-make-a-close-friends-list-on-instagram-and-add-friends>#</a></h3><p>To make a close friends list on and add friends, just follow these steps:</p><ol><li><p>Launch the Instagram application on your Android and iOS devices.</p></li><li><p>Tap on the Profile tab from the bottom-right corner of the screen.</p></li><li><p>Tap on the hamburger icon from the top-right corner of the screen.</p></li><li><p>Tap on the Close Friends option from the popup menu.</p></li><li><p>Tap on the Search bar and search for the desired username.</p></li><li><p>Select the profile and tap on the Done option to add that person to your close friends list on IG.</p></li></ol><p>This is how can you make a close friends list on Instagram and add friends to your close friends list on Instagram.</p><p>Also Read: How to View My Blocked List on Instagram</p><h3 id=how-to-remove-people-from-close-friends-list>How to Remove People from Close Friends List?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-remove-people-from-close-friends-list>#</a></h3><p>To know how to remove people from your close friends list on IG, just follow the below-mentioned steps:</p><p>Note: Make sure you are using the latest version of the Instagram app.</p><ol><li><p>Open the Instagram app and tap on the Profile tab from the bottom-right corner of the screen.</p></li><li><p>Tap on the hamburger icon from the top-right corner of the screen.</p></li><li><p>Tap on the Close Friends option from the popup menu.</p></li><li><p>Tap on the selected desired profile to unselect it and remove it from the list.</p></li><li><p>Tap on Done to confirm the process.</p></li></ol><p>This is how can you remove people from your close friends list on Insta.</p><h3 id=how-many-close-friends-can-you-have-on-instagram>How Many Close Friends Can You Have on Instagram?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-many-close-friends-can-you-have-on-instagram>#</a></h3><p>You can add as many close friends as you want because there is no limit to adding close friends. You can only add people from your follower list or the following list to your close friends on Instagram. Just like you add people, you can also remove them from the close friend list. And all these operations are done without notifying the users who have been added or removed. You are the only person who can view the close friend’s list and manage it, and no one else. Now, you know how many close friends can you have on Instagram.</p><p>Also Read: How to Make a Private Story on Snapchat for Close Friends</p><h3 id=how-to-know-if-you-are-on-someones-close-friends-list>How to Know If You are on Someone’s Close Friends List?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-know-if-you-are-on-someones-close-friends-list>#</a></h3><p>You won’t get notified when someone adds you to their close friend list on Insta. So, to know if you are on someone’s close friends list or not, follow these steps:</p><ol><li><p>Open the Instagram app on your device.</p></li><li><p>Locate the story with a green circle around it. If the outer ring is green colored, that means you are on the close friends list of that person.</p></li></ol><p>Note: The green-colored outer story ring will only appear when the person shares their story to close friends.</p><p>This is how you can know if you are on someone’s close friends list on IG or not.</p><h3 id=can-you-have-multiple-close-friends-lists-on-instagram>Can You Have Multiple Close Friends Lists on Instagram?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#can-you-have-multiple-close-friends-lists-on-instagram>#</a></h3><p>No, you cannot have multiple close friends lists on Instagram. You can have multiple IG close friends and can also have multiple friends lists on Instagram, like favorites and close friends. But you and no one on Instagram can make multiple close friends lists. There is only one close friend list on Insta, and if you want, you can add or remove anyone from your list anytime. Close friends list contains those who are nearest and dearest to you, and you want to share some posts, stories, or Reels only with them and not with other followers of yours on IG.</p><h3 id=can-you-see-someones-close-friends-on-instagram>Can You See Someone’s Close Friends on Instagram?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#can-you-see-someones-close-friends-on-instagram>#</a></h3><p>No, you can’t see someone’s close friends on IG. You can only view your close friends list on IG through your IG account. As you cannot see someone’s close friends list, you cannot tell whether or not you are on the same list. When someone on Instagram adds you to their close friend list or removes you from their close friend list, you don’t get notified that the person has added you as a close friend. And as you don’t get notified, you won’t be able to determine whether you are on the close friends list or not.</p><p>Recommended:</p><ul><li>How to Log Out of Facebook App</li><li>How to Find Random Lives on Instagram</li><li>How to Get My Eyes Only on Snapchat</li><li>How to Make Instagram Private</li></ul><p>We hope that you learned about how to join close friends on Instagram.
