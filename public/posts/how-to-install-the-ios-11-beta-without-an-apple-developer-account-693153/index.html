Apple recently released the beta version of iOS 11, and many users are eager to try out the new features. However, the company requires a developer account to access the beta version, which costs $99 per year. But what if I told you there was a way to install iOS 11 beta for free, no developer account required? Keep reading to find out how.\nWhat is iOS 11 Beta? iOS 11 is the latest operating system for Apple’s mobile devices, and it comes with exciting new features such as a redesigned Control Center, improved Siri, and a new Files app. Beta versions are released to developers and beta testers to test the software and provide feedback before it is released to the general public.\nWhy You May Want to Install iOS 11 Beta Installing the iOS 11 beta is not without risks. Because it is a pre-release version, it may contain bugs and other issues that could affect your device’s performance. However, if you are willing to take the risk, installing the beta version means you get to try out the new features before anyone else.\nHow to Install iOS 11 Beta for Free To install iOS 11 beta for free, follow these steps:\nBackup your device – Before installing a beta version of iOS, it is essential to backup your device, in case anything goes wrong during the installation or if you encounter issues with the beta version later.\nDownload the iOS 11 beta profile – There are multiple websites where you can download the iOS 11 beta profile for free. A quick Google search can give you a list of websites offering the profile.\nInstall the iOS 11 beta profile – Once you have downloaded the beta profile, follow the instructions to install it on your device. This will enable your device to access the beta version of iOS 11.\nUpdate to iOS 11 beta – After installing the beta profile, you can update your device’s software to the beta version of iOS 11. Go to Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update, and you should see the update available.\nThat’s it! You can now enjoy the iOS 11 beta version for free, without the need for an Apple Developer account.\nTips for Using iOS 11 Beta While using the iOS 11 beta, keep in mind:\nBeta versions are not recommended for everyday use, as they may contain bugs and other issues that could affect your device’s performance. Be prepared for unexpected issues and bugs while using the beta version. Remember that beta versions are meant for testing purposes, and some features may not work as intended. Provide feedback to Apple if you encounter any issues or bugs while using the beta version. Conclusion Installing the iOS 11 beta version for free is a great way to try out the new features before they are released to the general public. However, keep in mind that beta versions are not recommended for everyday use, as they may contain bugs and other issues that could affect your device’s performance. Follow the steps outlined above to unlock the secret to installing iOS 11 beta for free, and enjoy the new features!\nJust about every year, Apple announces new software and occasionally some hardware at its World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC). With that, the public and developers alike are stoked for the newest version of iOS.\nDevelopers, of course, must get access to the newest operating system well before the public release in the fall so that they can better prepare their apps to perform well and play nice with the new operating system. Even though the new version of iOS becomes available for developers to download and install nearly immediately after the Keynote, regular users still want to get their hands on the software. It’s typically frowned upon by Apple to do so, but it can be done.\nJust know that downloading and installing the new iOS 11 on a non-development device is not recommended as it will likely be bug-filled and have crashes from time to time. Again, I strongly recommend NOT installing iOS 11 onto a mission-critical device.\nYou can, however, wait until Apple releases the public iOS beta in just a few weeks, to avoid so many bugs and crashes. You can click here to sign up to recieve the profile when it is ready.\nAlso, make a full backup to iCloud or iTunes on your PC or Mac before continuing. This way you can revert back to an old version of iOS if need be.\nWhat New Features Are Offered in iOS 11? This is not by any means a deep and detailed list but a few new features to get excited about include:\nThe addition of a Dock like that on Mac for iPad An all-new, redesigned Control Center with customizability and 3D-Touch support View recent notifications at a glance and older ones with a swipe “Do Not Disturb While Driving” New compression formats for photos and video An all-new Files app Installing the iOS 11 Developer Beta To install the iOS 11 Developer Beta, simply copy and paste the following link (https://beta.applebetas.co/ios) into Safari for this to work properly. Opening the link through any other application (such as if this article were being viewed within a Reddit client) will effectively block the profile install window from being launched.\nClick “Install” from this newly-opened window within the iOS Settings application.\nOnce installed, restart your device.\nThen, launch Settings, visit General, then Software Update. iOS 11 Developer Beta 1 will now be captured through the update portal, and you can now begin the download and install process.\nThis update will be installed like any other update. Just be sure to keep your device plugged in and do not restart it for any reason. This could corrupt the update.\nDowngrading Back to iOS 10 To downgrade, things can get a bit more complicated. This is why it is suggested not to install iOS 11 on a mission-critical device and if you are not all that tech savvy. Downgrading will require a Mac or PC with iTunes installed.\nBegin by fully shutting down your iOS device. Place it in Recovery Mode by holding down the Home button indefinitely. When the device shows “Connect to iTunes,” release the Home button.\nLaunch iTunes and plug in your iOS device running iOS 11.\nAn iTunes window describing the device as being in recovery mode will launch. Click “okay” to begin the restore process.\nFinally, click restore and update.\nYour iOS 11 backups will be non-functional, but any from iOS 10 will be! You can restore from one of these or set up your iOS device as a new one.\nConclusion What’s your favorite feature of iOS 11? Also, what bugs have you ran into over the course of using iOS 11, and how did you get around them? We would love to know in a comment! If you have any questions or issues regarding the process, please leave a comment below, and we will be sure to get back to you.\nI’m a junior at UT Dallas, a tech enthusiast, an adreneline junkie, and a coffee fanatic.\nOur latest tutorials delivered straight to your inbox\n","wordCount":"1218","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dennis Mcfarlane"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-install-the-ios-11-beta-without-an-apple-developer-account-693153/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock the Secret to Installing iOS 11 Beta for Free - No Apple Developer Account Required!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 8, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1218 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Dennis Mcfarlane</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#what-is-ios-11-beta>What is iOS 11 Beta?</a></li><li><a href=#why-you-may-want-to-install-ios-11-beta>Why You May Want to Install iOS 11 Beta</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-install-ios-11-beta-for-free>How to Install iOS 11 Beta for Free</a></li><li><a href=#tips-for-using-ios-11-beta>Tips for Using iOS 11 Beta</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li><li><a href=#what-new-features-are-offered-in-ios-11>What New Features Are Offered in iOS 11?</a></li><li><a href=#installing-the-ios-11-developer-beta>Installing the iOS 11 Developer Beta</a></li><li><a href=#downgrading-back-to-ios-10>Downgrading Back to iOS 10</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion-1>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=unlock-the-secret-to-installing-ios-11-beta-for-free---no-apple-developer-account-required>Unlock the Secret to Installing iOS 11 Beta for Free - No Apple Developer Account Required!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#unlock-the-secret-to-installing-ios-11-beta-for-free---no-apple-developer-account-required>#</a></h1><p>Apple recently released the beta version of iOS 11, and many users are eager to try out the new features.
