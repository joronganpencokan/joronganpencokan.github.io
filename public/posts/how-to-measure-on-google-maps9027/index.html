Depending on what you are trying to measure, the satellite view may provide a more accurate picture of the area.\nStep 3: Select Start and End Points To measure distance on Google Maps, you will need to select your starting and ending points by dropping pins on the map. This can be done by tapping and holding on a section of the map until a red pin appears. You can then drag the pin to your desired location.\nStep 4: Place a Marker Once you have dropped your first pin, you will need to drop a second pin at your desired endpoint. To do this, simply repeat step three by tapping and holding another section of the map until the red pin appears.\nStep 5: Measure Distance With your two pins in place, you can now measure the distance between them by tapping on the first pin and selecting “Measure distance” from the drop-down menu. You can then tap on the second pin to complete your measurement.\nStep 6: View Your Distance Calculation After measuring the distance between your two points, the app will display the measurement in either metric or imperial units. You can also view the route between the two points and any additional details such as elevation.\nTips for Accurately Measuring Distance on Google Maps Make sure your pins are accurately placed on the map to ensure the most precise measurement. Consider using the satellite view to get a more accurate picture of the area you are measuring. Use the “Measure distance” feature multiple times for complex routes to get an accurate overall measurement.
