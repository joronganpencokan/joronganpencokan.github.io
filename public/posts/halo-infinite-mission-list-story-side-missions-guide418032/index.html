Halo Infinite is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated video game releases of 2021. It holds a special place in the hearts of gamers worldwide who have been eagerly waiting for the continuation of the Master Chief’s journey since the last release in 2015. With the promise of an open-world, immersive gameplay experience, Halo Infinite is set to redefine the franchise and take it to new heights.\nThe Halo franchise has always had a richly immersive storyline, with a mix of main missions and side missions that allow players to explore more of the Halo universe. Halo Infinite is no different, with an extensive open world to explore and several side missions to complete, promising hours of adventure and maximum fun. So let’s take a look at the ultimate guide to Halo Infinite’s epic missions and storyline, including the must-play side missions for a complete gaming experience.\nThe Storyline Halo Infinite’s storyline is set in the same universe as the previous games but takes place several years after the events of Halo 5: Guardians. Master Chief, the protagonist, is now aboard a damaged UNSC (United Nations Space Command) vessel and has to battle the Banished, a group of alien mercenaries who are trying to take control of a Forerunner ring. The story is focused on the Master Chief’s journey to stop the Banished and save humanity.\nThe game’s story is divided into multiple chapters, each with its unique set of main missions, cut-scenes, and side missions. The storyline is a must-play and a crucial part of the overall gaming experience. The game’s open world structure provides players with the freedom to explore the beautifully designed maps, engage in dynamic fights, and interact with non-playable characters (NPCs), all while following the storyline.\nThe Main Missions Halo Infinite’s main missions are the core of the storyline, and they are necessary to progress through the game. The main missions are epic, grandiose, and filled with unique obstacles to overcome. The game’s design ensures that players remain engaged and at the edge of their seat throughout each mission. The main missions are well-designed and provide a healthy mix of combat, exploration, and puzzles.\nThe main missions are scattered throughout the game, and each has a unique theme and purpose, making them essential to completing the story mode. Players will have to remain sharp and focus on every objective to complete each mission successfully.\nThe Side Missions Side missions are optional, but they are an integral part of the Halo Infinite gaming experience. Side missions are different from the main missions, often having unique objectives and providing bonuses that players can use to enhance their gameplay experience. Side missions offer an opportunity to explore the game’s world more extensively and interact with NPCs.\nHalo Infinite has several side missions that players must experience to fully appreciate the game’s open-world design. The side missions are divided into different categories, including Forerunner structures, Marine Rescues, Spartan Core Locations, and Banished Outposts.\nForerunner structures are ancient structures filled with puzzles and enemy encounters. Players will have to use their wits and gaming prowess to conquer these structures.\nMarine rescues are a series of missions that task players with rescuing marines who are stranded on the map. These missions provide players with unique rewards and are a great way to hone their skills.\nSpartan Core locations are areas where players can find Spartan Cores that grant them abilities such as a faster recharge rate for their shields or higher damage resistance.\nLastly, the Banished Outposts are enemy-controlled bases that players can capture and defend against subsequent enemy attacks. These missions are challenging but are well worth the effort due to the rewards.\nConclusion Halo Infinite’s epic missions and storyline provide hours of gameplay, while side missions add more depth to the game’s world and playstyle. Halo Infinite is a game for fans of the franchise, but it is also an excellent game for anyone looking for a well-designed open-world first-person shooter (FPS) experience. The Halo Infinite storyline is an essential component of the game, but the optional side missions add a depth to the game that is not normally seen in most FPS titles. The Halo universe is vast, and Halo Infinite does an excellent job of bringing it to life.\nSo grab your gaming console or PC, and get ready for an unforgettable adventure. Play the main missions, discover the side missions, and immerse yourself in Halo Infinite’s world. It’s time to save humanity, to pick up the battle rifle, and to become the Master Chief.\nHalo Infinite’s recent campaign geared up things for the series installment. Garnering positive responses from both critics and fans, Halo’s campaign is out since 8th December, almost a month after the multiplayer’s release. It would take 10-12 hours for an average player to complete the campaign depending on if they complete the side-quests or not. The campaign allows players to explore more of the game with free roam open-world of Zeta ring and complete several side missions. Now with no further ado, let’s take a look at all the missions included in Halo Infinite campaign.\nHow Many Missions are there in Halo Infinite Campaign? As the campaign does not include the select chapter menu, you cannot reset the missions once you complete them. 343 Industries are planning to update that in the future allowing users to reset the missions, so that they do not miss a chance in obtaining any collectibles. This update might also include traditional modes like Co-Op mode which allowed players to invite friends in-game and Forge mode allowing players to customize maps. Here is the complete list of total missions and side missions included in the campaign.\nHalo Infinite Campaign Missions List There are 14 total storyline missions in the campaign:\nWarship Gbraakon Foundation Outpost Tremonius The Tower Excavation Site Spire Pelican Down The Sequence Nexus The Command Spire Repository The Road House of Reckoning Silent Auditorium Side Missions List In addition to the storyline missions, Here is a list of side missions to be completed in the campaign:\nCapture 12 FOB bases Clear 7 Banished Outposts Rescue 20 UNSC marines Eliminate 15 high-value targets This was the Halo Infinite missions list as well as the side missions that you can play.
