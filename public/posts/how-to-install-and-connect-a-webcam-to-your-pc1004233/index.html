Avoid sitting in front of bright windows or harsh overhead lighting.\nBackground: Make sure your background is clean and clutter-free. A plain or professional-looking background is preferable.\nPositioning: Position your webcam at eye level. This will give the impression that you’re making eye-contact with the other party.\nAudio: Invest in a good quality microphone or use a headset to ensure clear audio during your video calls.\nBy following this ultimate webcam installation guide, you can revolutionize the way you work and connect with others. With a good quality webcam and the right setup, you can enhance your video conferencing experience and communicate more effectively with colleagues, clients, or friends.\nThis article explains how to connect and set up your USB webcam on Windows 10. It gives you two basic options to get running. Information in this article applies generally to webcams used with a PC that has Windows 10 installed.\nWhat To Know\nDownload and install the webcam software or use the provided disk.Alternatively, just plug and play. Windows 10 will automatically set up your webcam. Install Your Webcam Software Before you can use your webcam, install its drivers on your computer. Depending on the webcam, it came with either a disk containing the drivers or with instructions to find the drivers online. If your computer doesn’t have a disk drive, go to the “No Disk” section of this guide.\nUse the Provided Disk Unless otherwise instructed, insert the disk that came with the webcam before you plug it in. Windows recognizes that you are attempting to install software and starts a wizard to guide you through the process.\nIf the wizard doesn’t start automatically, go to the Windows taskbar and select File Explorer (on Windows 10) or My Computer (on older versions of Windows). Or, in the Search box, enter This PC. Then, click the disk drive (usually E:) to install the files on the disk.\nNo Disk? No Problem! Plug and Play If the web camera didn’t come with a software disk, plug it in and see what happens. Most often, Windows will recognize it as new hardware and can use it. If Windows can’t use the webcam, you’re guided through the process of searching for drivers (either online or on your computer).\nTo use Windows Update to look for drivers manually:\nAs disk drives become less common, webcam manufacturers increasingly provide the latest drivers online.\nGo to the Search box and search for Device Manager. The Device Manager displays a complete list of devices on the computer. Go to Cameras or Imaging Devices, right-click the webcam, then select Update driver. Walk through the wizard to see if Windows can find the drivers. If nothing happens when you plug in the webcam, and Windows can’t find the drivers, read the instruction manual or visit the webcam manufacturer’s website to locate driver software for the webcam. Find Your Webcam’s USB (or Other) Connection Most webcams connect with a USB cord or something similar. Locate a USB port on the computer. It’s usually on the front or the back of the computer and looks like a tiny rectangle with a USB icon.\nGo to the Search box and search for Device Manager.\nThe Device Manager displays a complete list of devices on the computer. Go to Cameras or Imaging Devices, right-click the webcam, then select Update driver. Walk through the wizard to see if Windows can find the drivers.\nIf nothing happens when you plug in the webcam, and Windows can’t find the drivers, read the instruction manual or visit the webcam manufacturer’s website to locate driver software for the webcam.\nTypically, when you plug in the webcam, Windows automatically opens the installed software. Or, go to the Start menu to open the webcam software.\nKeep Your Webcam on a Flat Surface You don’t have to be a professional photographer to take effective webcam videos or photos, but a few tricks of the trade do apply. Place the webcam on a flat surface​ so that pictures and videos don’t appear crooked or skewed. Use a stack of books or a tripod to align the webcam to shoot video of something other than what’s directly in front of the screen.\nClip Your Webcam to Your Monitor Depending on the style and model of the webcam, it may or may not have an adjustable clip to attach it to the monitor. Clipping your webcam to the monitor is helpful when recording a webcast, making a video diary, or chatting with friends or family. If the monitor is thin, it might take some creativity to secure it.\nThe built-in clip feature puts desktop webcams a step above standard laptop webcams, given that they tend to be stuck in the same place centered at the top of the monitor.\nOnce Connected, Browse to Your Webcam Software After you connect the webcam and position it as desired, turn it on and see what it can do.\nTo use the software that came with the webcam, go to the Start menu and browse to the webcam program, shown here as Logitech Webcam Software. Yours will be associated with the brand and model of your webcam.\nIf you don’t like the software that came with your webcam, Windows 10 comes with a Camera app that works well with most brands of webcams.\nHow do I use a phone as a webcam?
