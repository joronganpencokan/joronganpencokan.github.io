This article will look at how to keep karaoke songs on USB and burn new karaoke CDs.\nWhat to Know\nKaraoke CDs and songs include an audio file and a graphics file, and both need to be in the folder and named correctly to work.Building a file structure according to the machine’s instructions will assist in making songs searchable and playable.You can play karaoke CDs on a computer with karaoke software, which requires no ripping or burning. How Do I Transfer My Karaoke CDs to a USB Drive? For a karaoke CD to work correctly, it needs three things: A graphics file; generally, a video file such as .avi or a format called .cdg; an audio file, such as MP3; and a way to understand that these two things belong together, called a “file structure.” Building the file structure is the most important part of USB playback. The video and audio need to have the same name on your data source.\nThis is only for personal use (not to be sold or given away). The RIAA explains what piracy is and how to avoid it.\nCheck your karaoke machine’s manual to ensure it has a USB port used to read data. Some karaoke machines, such as Singing Machine, will only accept songs on a USB drive downloaded from their store. In your karaoke machine’s manual, check for instructions on creating the file structure. Write down precisely how it wants each file to be named. For example, if the karaoke machine operates by entering in a number, you will want to name both the music file and the graphics file after that number. Use a spreadsheet program to write down relevant information, like singer, title, and song number. It will create a “directory” you can use to track songs and make them easier to find when singing. Open your file manager by pressing Windows + E in Windows or Command-N to open the Finder on Mac. Select and open your USB drive from the column on the left. Back up and delete any files you might find on the drive if you’ve used it before. It will help the karaoke machine find your songs faster. Insert your karaoke CD into your CD drive.

Plug the USB drive into your karaoke machine and try out a few songs to make sure they load correctly. How Do I Burn a Karaoke CD?

Name them according to the karaoke machine’s file format, such as 00001.cdg and 00001.mp3. Add each file to your burning software, checking each file name as needed. Then select Burn and test your CD once complete. Can My Karaoke Machine Play Songs From a USB Drive?
