From silent assassinations to stealthy infiltration, the game offers an immersive experience that challenges your wit and your skill. But, have you ever considered the art of remote explosives?\nWith this guide, you’ll be able to blend in the crowd and blow your target’s mind with these simple steps.\nStep 1: Choose Your Explosives\nThe first step in mastering remote explosives is to choose the right tool for the job. Hitman 3 offers a range of explosives that can be detonated remotely, including the Remote Explosive, Remote Concussion Device, and Explosive Phone. Each device has a distinct blast radius and damage output, so choose wisely based on your location and the target’s proximity.\nStep 2: Plan Your Detonation\nOnce you’ve chosen your explosive, you need to plan your detonation. The key to a successful remote detonation is timing. You want to detonate the explosive at the perfect moment to ensure maximum damage and minimal collateral damage.\nOne way to plan your detonation is to place the explosive in a chokepoint or pathway where your target will pass by. If you’re feeling daring, you can even plant the explosive directly on your target (assuming you have an opportunity to do so undetected).\nStep 3: Detonate!\nOnce you’ve placed the explosive and timed your detonation, it’s time to pull the trigger and watch the fireworks. Depending on the explosive you’ve chosen, you may need to press a button on your remote detonator or use a specific method of triggering the explosive.\nAfter the explosion, make sure you make a hasty getaway to avoid detection or suspicion from nearby NPCs.\nConclusion\nRemote explosives are an effective tool for any assassin in Hitman 3. By following these simple steps, you’ll be able to master the art of remote explosives and leave your targets scratching their heads (or what’s left of them). Remember, choose your tool, plan your detonation, and watch it all explode in front of your eyes!\nEven though Agent 47 has everything from Fiber Wire to Sniper Rifles, and heavy weapons in his arsenal but no other weapon is as fun to use as the Remote Explosives. We had a lot of fun with it in both previous installments of the World of Assassination trilogy. But even though it’s fun, you have to be very smart in the way you assassinate your target or use it as an integral asset in your mission. Here for all those who just picked up Hitman 3, we have the step by step guide on how to equip Remote Explosives and use them.\nHow To Use Remote Explosives In Hitman 3? Just as in both previous games, you can utilize different weapons spread across various levels in maps and the same applies to remote explosives. In Berlin, you will find them in Level 5 \u0026 Level 20. You can level up ahead in the game to unlock the ability to begin a mission with Remote Explosives. Make sure to loot the bodies you subdued. The higher the status of guards, the better weapons you will be able to pick up from them.\nHow to Equip Once you have acquired them, you can equip them from your inventory by cycling through it by left/right D-pad on your controller. For PC players, press I to swap inventory items. As there is no dedicated button to place bombs or items in the game, you can work around this by dropping the object where you stand. This is unlike coins which, could be thrown from far away.\nAs soon as you equip the Remote Explosive, you can drop it at Agent 47’s foot by pressing the down button on D-pad. That’s Z on PC by default. Make sure to remember the location and move away from the blast radius and vicinity. The moment you drop the bomb, Agent 47 will automatically equip its detonator in his hands. You can either detonate the explosive by pressing R2 in PS \u0026 RT in Xbox. Once your target is near the explosive device, you can ignite the bomb and set it off.\nIf you change your mind and don’t want to use it just yet, you can holster the item by pressing up on D-pad and H/Mouse 3 on PC.\nThat’s all you need to know about equipping and using Remote Explosives in Hitman 3.
