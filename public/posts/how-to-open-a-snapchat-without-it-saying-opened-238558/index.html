Snapchat is one of the most widely used and popular social media platforms among the youth of today. The unique feature of the app that allows users to share content that disappears after a short period has made it increasingly popular among teens and young adults. One of the features which have made Snapchat even more interesting is the “Stories’’ option, which allows users to share multiple photos and videos as a story that remains visible for 24 hours. However, not being able to view the stories of your crush or ex without them knowing can be frustrating. Here’s a secret trick that allows you to sneakily view Snapchat stories without anyone knowing!\nStep 1: Turn on Airplane Mode The first step is to turn on Airplane mode on your phone. Go to your phone’s settings and turn it on or swipe up from the bottom of your phone screen and toggle the Airplane mode button.\nStep 2: Open Snapchat and View the Story After turning on Airplane mode, open your Snapchat account and view the story you want to see. Make sure you completely view the story and let it play out. You can even take a screenshot of the story if you want to save it.\nStep 3: Close Snapchat and Turn off Airplane Mode The next step is to close Snapchat and turn off Airplane mode. To turn off Airplane mode, go to your phone settings and toggle the Airplane mode button back off or swipe up and toggle the button off.\nStep 4: Clear the Snapchat App Cache The final step is to clear your Snapchat app cache. Go to your Snapchat settings, scroll down to the bottom, and select “Clear Cache.\" This will clear any remnants of the story you viewed from your app data.\nAnd voila! You have now sneakily viewed the Snapchat story without anyone knowing. The user whose story you viewed won’t be aware that you have viewed their story since you were in airplane mode, and Snapchat does not send a notification for views while there is no internet connection.\nHowever, it’s important to keep in mind that using this trick for malicious purposes such as stalking or harassing someone is not okay. It’s essential to respect other people’s privacy and not use this trick to violate it.\nIn conclusion, Snapchat is a fun and entertaining social media platform, but sometimes you may want to view someone’s story without being noticed. The above-mentioned trick is an easy and effective way to do that without anyone knowing. But always remember to use social media responsibly and respect others’ privacy.\nThis article explains how to open a Snapchat without the sender knowing. Instructions apply to iOS and Android devices.\nWhat to Know\nOpen the Conversations tab, put your device in airplane mode to disconnect from the internet, then open the snap. Delete the app’s cache, then reconnect to the internet.To test it out, create another Snapchat account and send messages between your accounts. How to Read Snapchat Messages Without Them Knowing The following instructions work for photo and video snaps as well as chat messages.\nOnce you’ve received a new snap or chat message from a friend, navigate to the Conversations tab by swiping right from the camera tab. If the snap or chat message hasn’t fully loaded yet, allow it to load. Once it’s done loading, you should see a pink square and New Snap label (if it’s a snap), or a blue arrow and New Chat label (if it’s a chat message) beneath your friend’s name. Don’t tap it to view it or read it! Put your device on airplane mode to disconnect from the internet. On iOS devices, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to reveal the control center and tap the airplane icon so it turns orange.On Android devices, swipe down from the top of the screen to reveal your quick settings and tap the airplane icon so it turns blue. Now that you’re disconnected from the internet, it’s safe to view your friend’s snap or read their chat message. Go back to the Snapchat app and tap your friend’s name + New Snap to view their snap, or tap your friend’s name + New Chat to read their chat message. Before you turn airplane mode off and reconnect again, you have to clear your cache within the Snapchat app. Tap your profile icon/Bitmoji in the top right of the app, then tap the gear icon in the top right of your profile tab. On the Settings tab, scroll down to the Account Actions section and tap Clear Cache \u003e Clear All. Tap Okay to confirm. This step is essential to secretly opening snaps, so if you forget to do it, your friend will still see the “Opened” label despite you opening it while on airplane mode. Clearing the cache merely clears certain data that helps the app run faster, but can take up extra space. Don’t worry—none of your saved snaps in Memories or chats are lost. Now it’s safe to turn airplane mode off. On iOS, swipe up from the screen and tap the airplane icon in the control center to reconnect.On Android, swipe down from the screen and tap the airplane icon in the quick settings. When your friend looks at their Conversations tab, all they’ll see is a Delivered label beneath your name. Try It Yourself The best way to confirm this method works is by using two Snapchat accounts, where one account sends a snap to the other. Follow the steps above using the recipient account, then verify the sender account never sees an Opened label by looking for the Delivered label instead.\nOnce you’ve received a new snap or chat message from a friend, navigate to the Conversations tab by swiping right from the camera tab.\nIf the snap or chat message hasn’t fully loaded yet, allow it to load. Once it’s done loading, you should see a pink square and New Snap label (if it’s a snap), or a blue arrow and New Chat label (if it’s a chat message) beneath your friend’s name.\nDon’t tap it to view it or read it!\nPut your device on airplane mode to disconnect from the internet.\nOn iOS devices, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to reveal the control center and tap the airplane icon so it turns orange.On Android devices, swipe down from the top of the screen to reveal your quick settings and tap the airplane icon so it turns blue.

When your friend looks at their Conversations tab, all they’ll see is a Delivered label beneath your name.\nYou can do this by simply creating a test account along with your regular account, but an easier way to do it is to get a friend to test it with you.\nCan I screenshot a Snapchat without someone knowing?

No. You can search for someone on Snapchat without them knowing, but they will receive a notification if you add them. How do I block someone on Snapchat without them knowing?
