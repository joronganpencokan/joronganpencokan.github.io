Are you tired of using the same old techniques that no longer work? It’s time to change your approach and embrace the power of social media. Integrating Topsy into your WordPress site can do wonders for your traffic.\nTopsy is a social media analytics and insights tool that helps you track, analyze, and monitor social conversations. It allows you to stay up-to-date with the latest social trends and extract valuable insights from the abundance of social data. By integrating Topsy into your WordPress site, you can tap into this wealth of information and leverage it to increase your traffic.\nHere are some ways integrating Topsy into your WordPress site will skyrocket your traffic:\nReal-time Social Insights Topsy provides real-time social insights, giving you access to the latest conversations and buzz on social media. These insights can help you stay ahead of the curve and create content that resonates with your audience. By analyzing social data, you can identify trending topics, high-traffic keywords, and popular hashtags to incorporate into your content strategy.\nEnhanced Social Sharing Topsy makes it easy to share your content on social media. With Topsy’s social sharing buttons, visitors can easily share your content on their favorite social media platforms. You can also track the number of shares and engagement your content receives on social media, giving you valuable feedback on what’s working and what’s not.\nIncreased Social Engagement Topsy allows you to engage with your audience on social media in real-time. By monitoring social conversations related to your brand, you can respond to inquiries, address concerns, and participate in relevant discussions. This level of engagement can help build trust and authority in your industry, leading to increased traffic and conversions.\nBetter Content Creation Topsy’s social insights are a goldmine for content creators. By analyzing social data, you can identify the topics and keywords that are most popular among your audience. You can then use this information to create content that meets their needs and interests.\nDetailed Analytics Topsy provides detailed analytics that allow you to track the success of your social media campaigns. You can monitor the number of clicks, shares, and engagement your content receives on social media, as well as track your follower growth and mentions. This information can help you refine your social media strategy and improve your overall performance.\nIn conclusion, integrating Topsy into your WordPress site can do wonders for your traffic. By tapping into the power of social media, you can stay ahead of the curve and create content that resonates with your audience. With real-time insights, enhanced social sharing, increased social engagement, better content creation, and detailed analytics, Topsy integration is a must-have for any website looking to increase traffic and engagement.\nThe search engines that we are used to, like Google and Yahoo, rely on spiders crawling through web sites indexing the keywords they find. Therefore, when someone is searching for a certain topic, like “technology,” these search engines will display whatever they found, ranked by popularity on the page. Topsy is different. It’s a people-powered search engine for tweets.\nUsing the Web Site When you log in, you will see a search page like you would see for any search engine. It has the current trending topics, if you wanted to check out what is popular on Twitter.\nWhen you search for something, then the search results are shown in the image below. On the left-hand corner, you can decide what timeline you want to choose from. Also, you can select if you want to search the web, photos, or actual tweets. However, viewing the web allows you to view the tweets as well because the listing has the tweet below.\nIf you decide to log in with your Twitter user ID and password, you will see a home page that shows all of the things that you have posted on social media networks, how many times people have tweeted the same link, and information, like your web site, that Twitter account is associated with.\nOn March 3rd, Topsy introduced alerts. You can get search results right to your inbox.\nAdding a Topsy Button To Your WordPress Site Like Tweetmeme, Topsy allows you to place a retweet button on your site. If you are using a WordPress site, there are two ways to add their button on your site: WordPress plugin and Javascript version.\nThe Topsy WordPress plugin is easy to install. After installing the plugin, you will go to Settings to customize the button. One thing that I like about Topsy, that I haven’t seen with other retweet buttons is that it gives you a wide range of options on where to display the retweet button. If you don’t want it on all your pages, then you can pick-and-choose which ones you want to place them on. You can also add your own CSS.\nI like the fact that you can change the color scheme to fit your site/blog. Also, that if you delete or update your blog, you are able to notify Topsy, and they will be sure to reflect that on their end. Very useful.\nThe trackback feature is pretty nifty because you can create trackbacks if someone leaves a comment. Not sure if I like this “Only create trackback comments from influential tweeters.” How can they know that? If I have a technology-type site/blog, the people I find influential are going to be different if I had a fashion site/blog. This is what it states on their site: “On our website, roughly the top 0.2% most influential of all Twitter users are tagged “Highly Influential”, and “Influential” tags appear for the top 0.5% most influential Twitter users.” I would love to hear from Topsy creators to figure out their calculation.\nTopsy is an interesting search engine and application. I like the layout and the search display on their web site. It’s also great that they have a user profile that allows you to see how your tweets are doing. However, with Google and Yahoo! partnering up with Twitter and having tweets as part of their search results, Topsy has to find a way to keep things interesting. Their WordPress plugin is one of the most flexible ones that I have seen when it comes to retweeting buttons. However, this “influential” tweeter trackback feature kind of threw me off. Overall, Topsy has potential.\nHave you used Topsy retweet button on your site?\nShevonne Polastre authors ChicWriter, a blog filled with writing tips and articles .
