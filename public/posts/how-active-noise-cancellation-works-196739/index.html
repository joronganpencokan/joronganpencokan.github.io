Millions of people around the world are in search of a way to make their daily commute more relaxing and peaceful. Luckily, there’s a solution - active noise cancellation.\nThis technology has been around for several decades, but it’s only recently started to become popular in consumer products. Active noise cancellation works by analyzing external noise and producing an opposing sound wave to cancel it out. This results in a quieter overall environment that’s conducive to focus and relaxation.\nBut how does it actually work? Let’s take a closer look.\nThe Science Behind Active Noise Cancellation\nAt its core, active noise cancellation is a form of sound wave interference. Sound waves are simply variations in air pressure that travel through space. When two sound waves of equal amplitude and frequency meet, they’ll either reinforce each other (creating a louder sound) or cancel each other out (creating silence).\nActive noise cancellation takes advantage of this phenomenon by using a microphone to pick up external noise and a speaker to produce a matching sound wave that’s out of phase (180 degrees out of phase, to be exact). These two sound waves then meet in the air and cancel each other out, resulting in quieter surroundings for the listener.\nTo make this work effectively, active noise cancellation requires some sophisticated technology. First and foremost, the microphone and speaker need to be carefully positioned relative to the person’s ears. They also need to be able to pick up and produce sound waves at extremely high speeds, since external noise can change rapidly as you move through your environment.\nThe other critical component of active noise cancellation is the algorithm that analyzes and produces the opposing sound wave. This algorithm needs to be finely tuned to account for differences in the listener’s ears and the external environment. That’s why high-quality noise-canceling headphones and earbuds often come with a calibration process that involves playing specific sounds and measuring the response of the listener’s ears.\nBenefits of Active Noise Cancellation for Commuting\nSo why should you care about active noise cancellation for your daily commute? There are several compelling reasons:\nReduced stress: Constant exposure to loud, distracting noise can increase stress levels and make it harder to relax. Active noise cancellation can create a more peaceful environment that’s better for mental health. Improved focus: When you’re trying to read, work or listen to music during your commute, external noise can be a major distraction. Active noise cancellation can reduce that distraction and help you stay focused on what you’re doing. Protection for your ears: Exposure to high levels of noise over time can damage your hearing. Active noise cancellation can reduce the overall volume of your surroundings, which can help protect your ears from long-term harm. If you’re ready to take advantage of the benefits of active noise cancellation, there are several products on the market that can help. High-quality noise-canceling headphones and earbuds are widely available from major electronics brands like Bose, Sony, and Apple. These products typically range in price from around $50 to $500 or more, depending on the model and features.\nSo the next time you’re stuck in a noisy subway car or crowded bus, remember that there’s a solution. Active noise cancellation technology can help you unlock a more tranquil and relaxing commute, one sound wave at a time.\nNoisy environments can both distract and irritate you when you want to get work done. Headphones with active noise-cancellation abilities can offer a respite, but do you know how they work?\nIn this article we discuss the manner in which headphones from Bose, Beats, and other brands keep outside noise out of your ears.\nThe Shape of Sound The most important lesson you should learn today is that sound waves follow a regular pattern. A sound wave of any frequency compresses and rarefies (releases the compression) molecules as it moves through the air. This is comparable to a transverse wave, which looks like the following image.\nIf the wave in that graph was a sound wave, you could easily determine its loudness and pitch. The wave’s height on the graph tells you its loudness; the wave’s frequency tells you its pitch.\nTherefore, the purple and green sound waves in this next image would have the same loudness but different pitches.\nFiltering Out Noise When unwanted noises occur, your headphones must use the characteristics of sound waves to begin making your world quieter.\nYour headphones require a battery to power an embedded microphone that listens for outside noise. The microphone recognizes the various frequencies reaching your ear, and then sends that information to its speaker – the same speaker you use to listen to your music.\nThe speaker then emits extra sound waves to combat offending noise. It does this by creating destructive interference that uses waves’ peaks and troughs against them.\nIn destructive interference, two sound waves of equal loudness and pitch can cancel out each other if they are 180 degrees out of phase. This graph demonstrates what that phase shift looks like.\nThe purple wave is the same wave shown in the first image of this article. The green wave is moved out of phase with the green wave by 180 degrees.\nBoth waves now have their peaks and troughs lining up, so their compression and rarefaction of air is eliminated. The sum of these two waves is a straight line across the center of the graph. Essentially, the combination creates no noise at all.\nNoise Cancellation Is Complicated Although the math of canceling out one sound wave is easy, the real world doesn’t limit itself to one distracting noise frequency at a single phase.\nThe noise cancellation available in your headphones is a masterpiece of engineering. It must identify all the sound wavelengths, intensities, and phases in your environment at a moment’s notice. Then it must effectively generate equal but opposite sound waves in addition to the music or audio you want to hear.\nIn the end, what you receive as noise-canceled audio isn’t always perfect. Your headphones should remove about seventy-percent of outside noise, and they probably won’t do well with sharp, sudden noises like a crying baby or slammed door. They will work best when removing consistent noises such as the murmur of a crowd or the hum of a jet plane.\nConclusion If you’re considering purchasing a pair of headphones for active noise cancellation, keep their abilities and limitations in mind.\nNow that you know how they work, be prepared for a less-than-perfect removal of unwanted sound, but stay optimistic about how far this amazing technology can actually get you.\nI have worked as a professional writer since 2011.
