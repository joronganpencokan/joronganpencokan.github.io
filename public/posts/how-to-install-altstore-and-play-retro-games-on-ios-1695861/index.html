Gaming has become an integral part of our lives. With the advent of mobile gaming, our smartphones have become the go-to device to satisfy our gaming needs. However, with the limited selection of games available on the App Store, we have been forced to look for alternate methods to access the games that we love.\nAltstore is an innovative platform that provides users with the ability to install games and apps that are not available on the App Store. This platform is easy to use and provides an excellent solution for users who want to install retro games and other apps on their iPhones.\nIn this guide, we will take you through the step-by-step process of installing Altstore on your iPhone and how to install retro games on your device.\nWhat is Altstore? Altstore is a third-party app platform that allows users to sideload apps and games onto their iPhones without requiring a jailbreak. This platform is unique as it is the first of its kind to use an App Store-like model for distributing apps.\nAdditionally, Altstore is an open-source platform, which means that it is entirely free, giving users full access to source code and other developer resources. It is an excellent platform for developers who are looking to distribute their apps and users who want to install apps that are not available on the App Store.\nRequirements Before we proceed with the installation process, you need to ensure that your device meets the following requirements:\nAn iPhone running iOS 12.2 or later A macOS device, running macOS 10.14.4 or later The latest version of iTunes An Apple ID account Step-by-step guide to installing Altstore The installation process for Altstore follows a few easy steps:\nDownload the Altstore app to your Mac device from https://altstore.io/.\nOnce downloaded, double-click the .dmg file to open the installer.\nDrag the Altstore icon to the Applications folder, and your installation process will begin.\nConnect your iPhone to your Mac device and open iTunes.\nClick on the iPhone icon that appears in the toolbar, then click on “File Sharing.”\nFind the Altstore app in the list of apps, click on it, then click on “Add File.”\nFind the Altstore.ipa file that you downloaded earlier and double-click it to add it to the list of synced files.\nAfter the sync process finishes, disconnect your iPhone from your Mac device.\nOpen the Altstore app on your iPhone and enter your Apple ID credentials.\nThe Altstore will now be installed on your iPhone.\nStep-by-step guide to installing Retro games After you have installed Altstore on your iPhone, you can now proceed to install retro games on your device:\nDownload the retro game that you want to install.\nConnect your iPhone to your Mac device and open iTunes.\nClick on the iPhone icon that appears in the toolbar, then click on “File Sharing.”\nFind the retro game app in the list of apps, click on it, then click on “Add File.”\nFind the retro game file that you downloaded earlier and double-click it to add it to the list of synced files.\nAfter the sync process finishes, disconnect your iPhone from your Mac device.\nOpen the Altstore app on your iPhone and click on the “My Apps” tab.\nYou should now see the retro game app that you added in the list of installed apps.\nTap on the app to launch it and start playing your favorite retro games on your iPhone.\nConclusion With the installation of Altstore, you can now access a wide variety of retro games, which were previously unavailable on the App Store. This platform is easy to use and follows a simple installation process that can be completed in a few easy steps.\nAdditionally, this platform does not require a jailbroken device, which means that it is safe to use and does not void your warranty.\nIn conclusion, if you want to unlock the ultimate gaming experience on your iPhone, you should definitely consider installing Altstore today.\nIf you’re firmly in the iOS camp, there’s a good chance you look lovingly at Android and its deep selection of emulator options. At least that was the case until Riley Testut introduced AltStore. AltStore enables iOS and iPadOS users the ability to add unauthorized third-party applications. For now, the application list only includes a few apps, like the hugely popular jailbreak app, Delta emulator. The app – which enables you to play Game Boy, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64 and more – is the best way to relive your childhood gaming obsessions on the iPhone and iPad. Here are all the steps you need to know to start playing Super Mario on your iPad today.\nHow to Install on Mac The very first step is to download AltServer for the Mac.\nOnce the download has completed, you can launch “AltServer,” and it will appear as an icon in the menu bar.\nConnect your iPhone or iPad to your computer and make sure each is unlocked. If the phone or iPad asks if it can “Trust” the computer, tap “Trust” to continue.\nClick on the AltStore icon in the Mac menu bar and select “Install Mail Plug-in.” This part is unusual, but the workaround for AltStore requires a specific plugin be installed as part of the Mail.app.\nEnter your Apple ID email and password. While privacy questions persist, it’s been made clear that AltStore never sees your Apple ID login information.\nYou will be prompted to install the Mail plugin. To do that, open Mail and select “File -\u003e Preferences.”\nSelect “Manage Plug-ins” and Enable “AltPlugin.mailbundle.” Click Apply and then restart Mail.\nYou’ve reached the final step. Click AltStore in the Mac menubar, select “Install AltStore” and then choose whichever iOS device is currently connected to your computer.\nHow to Install on Windows Before you install for Windows, it’s important to make sure you have iTunes and iCloud installed. The most important step here is to make sure you install the software directly from Apple and not from the Microsoft Store. You can get iTunes and iCloud here. After those downloads are complete, follow the next steps.\nDownload AltServer for Windows.\nExtract the downloaded “AltInstaller.zip” file anywhere on your desktop.\nDouble-click on the “setup.exe” file and continue with the installation instructions.\nConnect your iPhone or iPad. As is the case with the Mac, you may be required to click on “Trust” to continue.\nOpen iTunes (the one from the direct download links above) and enable “iTunes Wi-FI Sync” for your iPhone/iPad.\nClick on the AltServer icon in the Windows notification area, select “Install AltStore” and then choose your iOS device.\nWhen prompted, enter your Apple ID email and password.\nGive it a few seconds, and then AltStore should appear as an app on your device.\nImportant Note The way AltStore is built to work around Apple’s guardrails, it requires you to “update” your iOS or iPadOS device every seven days. AltStore offers some advice on how to best manage this process, but it does require the Mail app to be open as well as AltStore on the Mac. On Windows, just the AltStore needs to be open. When either of those platforms is ready, jump into the AltStore on the iOS device and “refresh” the downloaded apps.\nHow to Install Delta With AltStore installed, the next step is to add Delta, the actual Emulator app, to your iPhone or iPad.\nOpen AltStore on your iOS device. At the bottom of the app, you will see four options: News, Browse, My Apps and Settings. Tap on “My Apps.”\nAs soon as you tap on “Browse,” Delta is the first app you will see.\nClick on “Free” to install, and Delta will install itself as any other app would on your iOS device.\nPlaying Games Playing ROMS you don’t own is illegal, so we are going to assume that you have your own ROMs.\nDownload the ROM on either your computer or iOS device. Our recommendation is to create a new folder in Files to save all downloaded ROMs.\nOnce the file is downloaded, open Delta and look for the “+” sign. When you tap on it, it gives you two options: iTunes and Files. Select the “Files” option.\nLocate the ROM inside the Files app and tap on it. Delta will automatically know based on the file type which platform it should be loaded in. Super Nintendo files will load for Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64 for Nintendo 64, etc.\nAfter the app is in its appropriate folder, click on it to begin playing. The amount of ROMs you can add is really based on the amount of memory you have available on your device. Given the small file sizes of retro games, you can install hundreds, if not thousands, without taking up much room at all.\nDelta does have the option of installing additional emulators outside of the ones they offer by default. For example, PSP (Playstation Portable) fans can install PPSSPP. The same goes for DolphiniOS, which includes support for Dreamcast. Each of those apps are installed by downloading their install files into the Files app and hitting the “+” button at the top of the AltStore screen under the “My Apps” option.\nRetro gaming is currently enjoying a big comeback, thanks in part to the likes of hardware like the NES, Sega and SNES Classic. With software like AltStore and Delta, reliving those classics is easier than ever on your iPad. If you are not keen to play on your phone, you can build a Raspberry Pi retro gaming console instead.\nDavid is a freelance tech writer with over 15 years of experience in the tech industry.

Each of those apps are installed by downloading their install files into the Files app and hitting the “+” button at the top of the AltStore screen under the “My Apps” option.</p><p>Retro gaming is currently enjoying a big comeback, thanks in part to the likes of hardware like the NES, Sega and SNES Classic. With software like AltStore and Delta, reliving those classics is easier than ever on your iPad. If you are not keen to play on your phone, you can build a Raspberry Pi retro gaming console instead.</p><p>David is a freelance tech writer with over 15 years of experience in the tech industry.
