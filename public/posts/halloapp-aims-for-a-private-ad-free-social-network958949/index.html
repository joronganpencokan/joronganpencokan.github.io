Are you tired of seeing endless ads every time you open a social network? Are you concerned about your privacy being violated by advertisers? If yes, then you should check out Halloapp - a game-changing social network that promises to put an end to pesky ads and privacy concerns once and for all!\nHalloapp is a new social network that has been designed keeping the user’s privacy in mind. Unlike other social networks, Halloapp does not collect any personal information from its users. This means that you can use Halloapp without worrying about your data being shared with advertisers, marketers, or any other third-party.\nAnother thing that sets Halloapp apart from other social networks is that it does not display ads on your feed. This means that you can enjoy a clutter-free experience without any interruptions from annoying ads. As a result, you can focus on connecting with your friends and family without any distractions.\nIn addition, Halloapp also has a unique feature called the ‘hallo’. The ‘hallo’ is a virtual handshake that allows you to connect with people you know or meet new people without having to request their contact information. With the ‘hallo’, you can easily add a new friend to your contact list with just a single tap.\nWhat’s more, Halloapp also allows you to create groups based on your interests or location. This means that you can connect with people who share the same hobbies or live near you. This feature is especially useful for people who are new to a place or want to explore new interests.\nIn conclusion, Halloapp is a game-changing social network that offers a clutter-free, ad-free, and privacy-focused experience. With its unique ‘hallo’ feature and group creation tool, you can easily connect with your friends and family or meet new people who share the same interests as you. So what are you waiting for? Say goodbye to pesky ads and privacy concerns with Halloapp today!\nTwo former engineers from WhatsApp have created a new private social network called HalloApp, which focuses more on close-knit relationships and remaining ad-free.\nHalloApp launched quietly on Tuesday and is available to download on the App Store and the Google Play Store. The new app shares many similarities with WhatsApp, such as focusing on maintaining relationships with close friends and family via encrypted messaging. But it shies away from bombarding users with ads and, as stated in a post on the app’s official blog, “an algorithmic feed of meaningless content.”\nHalloApp has a minimalist design and aesthetic. It’s broken into four main tabs—a feed for friends’ posts, group chats, individual chats, and settings. There are no algorithms sorting posts into what the app thinks a user would want to see. The app also doesn’t have any ads or likes or followers; it’s meant for small group usage.\nThe app was developed and co-founded by Neeraj Arora and Michael Donohue, both of whom worked at WhatsApp before and after Facebook’s acquisition of it. Arora wrote HalloApp’s initial blog post, in which he subtly takes jabs at larger social media companies, and even goes as far to call social media “the 21st-century cigarette,” adding, “The more we inhale, the sicker we get.”\nWhile never directly mentioning Facebook, Arora’s criticisms of social media match common critiques people have of that social network. The creation of HalloApp seems to be a response to the current state of social media and the overall lack of privacy, judging from Arora’s words.\nArora also stresses the fact that HalloApp does not collect or store any personal data from any of its users, and concludes the post by stating the app’s vision is to create a safe and private place for people to connect.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"643","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-11T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-11T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jennifer Johnson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/halloapp-aims-for-a-private-ad-free-social-network958949/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Say Goodbye to Pesky Ads and Privacy Concerns with Halloapp - the Game-Changing Social Network!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-11 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 11, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;643 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jennifer Johnson</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=say-goodbye-to-pesky-ads-and-privacy-concerns-with-halloapp---the-game-changing-social-network>Say Goodbye to Pesky Ads and Privacy Concerns with Halloapp - the Game-Changing Social Network!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#say-goodbye-to-pesky-ads-and-privacy-concerns-with-halloapp---the-game-changing-social-network>#</a></h1><p>Are you tired of seeing endless ads every time you open a social network?
