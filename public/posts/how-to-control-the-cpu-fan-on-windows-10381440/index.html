Are you tired of your CPU fan getting too loud and annoying while performing intensive tasks on your PC? Do you wonder if there is any way to control the speed of the fan to ensure optimal performance without compromising on the noise? If yes, then you have come to the right place.\nIn this article, we will discuss how you can regulate your CPU fan speed to enhance your PC’s performance and minimize the noise generated by the fan using a simple hack. This hack will work with Windows 10 operating system, and you can easily follow the steps to implement it on your PC.\nWhy Is CPU Fan Control Necessary? Before we dive into how to control your CPU fan, let’s first understand why it is essential. When you perform heavy tasks on your PC, such as gaming or video editing, the CPU gets heated up. To ensure that the CPU does not overheat and get damaged, the CPU fan spins faster and louder to cool down the CPU. However, this can result in a noisy environment, which can be frustrating during long hours of usage.\nBy controlling the speed of your CPU fan, you can maintain an optimal temperature for your CPU while reducing the noise produced by the fan. This is especially useful when you are working in a quiet environment and need to focus on your work without any distractions.\nHow To Control Your CPU Fan on Windows 10? Now that you know why it is essential to control your CPU fan let’s look at how you can do it on your Windows 10 PC.\nStep 1: Download the Fan Control Application\nThe first step is to download and install the Fan Control application on your Windows 10 PC. There are several free applications available on the internet, such as SpeedFan, HWMonitor, and Open Hardware Monitor. You can choose any one of these applications depending on your preference.\nStep 2: Launch the Fan Control Application\nAfter installing the Fan Control application, launch it on your PC. The application will scan your PC for the hardware components and display them on the screen.\nStep 3: Configure the Fan Settings\nOnce the application has scanned your PC, you can configure the fan settings to regulate its speed. Click on the ‘Fan Control’ option, and a new window will appear. In this window, select the ‘Advanced Fan Control’ option to access more settings.\nIn the ‘Advanced Fan Control’ window, you can adjust the fan speed curve by dragging the points on the graph. You can set the fan speed at different temperature levels, ensuring that the fan spins faster when the CPU temperature rises and slows down when it cools down.\nStep 4: Save the Fan Settings\nAfter configuring the fan settings, click on the ‘Apply’ button to save these settings. You can also save these settings as a profile for future use.\nStep 5: Monitor the Fan Speed\nThe final step is to monitor the fan speed and temperature of your PC. Most Fan Control applications display real-time temperature and fan speed readings on the screen, allowing you to keep an eye on the CPU’s temperature and fan speed.\nConclusion By following these simple steps, you can easily control your CPU fan on Windows 10 and enhance your PC’s performance while reducing the noise produced by the fan. It is a simple hack that can significantly improve your PC’s usability and make your work environment more comfortable.\nSo, what are you waiting for? Give it a try and see the difference it makes to your PC’s performance.\nThis article explains how to take charge of CPU fan control in a Windows 10 computer. This involves going inside the PC case, so wear an anti-static wristband. Alternatively, touch something metal like the PC case before and periodically during your investigation. This grounds you and prevents static from shorting out any components.\nWhat to Know\nDetermine what kind of CPU you have and what kind of connector (3-pin, 4-pin, etc.) it uses.Easiest: From the BIOS, choose a fan type (DC or PWM), set mode, and set temperature threshold.Speedfan is a popular third-party software option for controlling a CPU. What Type of CPU Fan Do You Have? Before you can officially take control of your CPU fan speed, you need to make sure that its connector lets you do so:\nTurn off your PC and disconnect the power cable. Remove the left-hand side panel when viewing from the front. There should be some screws at the rear that when removed, let the panel pop off. In the majority of computers, the left-hand side panel is the one you will need to remove. If you happen to have a computer with a right-hand side panel (they’re pretty rare), the instruction are the same once the panel is removed. Find your CPU cooler. It will likely be in the top-third of your motherboard. The fan on it should have a cable that runs away from it. Metoc / Wikimedia The end of that cable will tell you everything you need to know. If it’s a chunky, four pin connector that plugs into a similar looking cable before routing to your power supply unit (PSU), it’s plugged in using a two or 4-pin Molex connector. If it’s a thinner cable that runs to your motherboard with a 3-pin female connector on the other end, it’s a DC fan. If it runs to a 4-pin female connector, it’s a PWM fan.\nTurn off your PC and disconnect the power cable.\nRemove the left-hand side panel when viewing from the front.

It will likely be in the top-third of your motherboard. The fan on it should have a cable that runs away from it.\nHere’s a quick explainer about those different types:\nMolex connectors take all their power from the PSU. They cannot be dynamically controlled and can only be limited using a resistor cable.3-pin DC connectors also run at full power, but your motherboard can limit the voltage going to them, thereby altering the speed.4-pin PWM (pulse width modulation) can be dynamically controlled by software and hardware very easily. Control CPU Fan in the BIOS The easiest way to adjust CPU fan speed is through the BIOS.\nEvery BIOS is different, so instructions may differ from computer to computer, but you need to look for a tab or screen associated with Hardware monitoring. In the screenshot below, it was listed as PC Health Status.\nLook for a section to do with the CPU Fan. Once there, try some of these settings below to see what adjustments you can make.\nSet the fan to your fan type (DC or PWM).Select what mode you want the fan to run at. Examples might include Full speed, Performance, Silent.Set a temperature threshold. Typically you don’t want a CPU to go over 70 degrees, so make sure that your fan runs fast once it gets that hot, and preferably starts to spin up quicker at lower temperatures. CPU Fan Control With Speedfan If your motherboard can dynamically control fan speeds, then you may be able to make more in-depth adjustments with Windows software. One of the most popular and long-lasting software suites is Speedfan.\nDownload Speedfan from the official website and install it like you would any other program. Spend some time getting to grips with the application. It can be a little opaque to start with and certain temperature settings may seem way off (ours recorded a temperature of 97 for “Auxtin1”) which suggests an erroneous reading because you don’t have a temperature sensor there. Speedfan is designed to be ubiquitous, so it hits all the bases, even if your system doesn’t support it. What that means is that you may see false readings for a number of different types of sensors that are not installed on your computer. Just look for the components that are installed and ignore the others. When you feel you’re ready to take some control, you can select Automatic fan speed to have Speedfan automatically control your system. Otherwise, select Configure then select the Advanced tab. Choose your CPU from the drop down menu. The labelling isn’t ideal, so you may need to play around to find the right one for your system. Find your CPU fan among the list based on what cable it connects to your motherboard and what port it connects to. Then set that to Manual. Alternatively, if you want to control every fan in your system, set them all to Manual. Select OK and head back to the main Speedfan page. Use the arrow keys next to your respective fan(s) to adjust the speed up and down. If it’s working correctly, you should see the RPM increase or decrease and hear your PC get louder or quieter, respectively. Fan Control in Windows 10 With a Fan Controller If you want more control over your CPU fan and other aspects of your system, a fan controller is a good bet. Cases like NZXT’s H-series i versions have a built-in link box which gives you software control over your CPU fan in much the same way as Speedfan, but in a more intuitive manner. It also adds support for RGB lighting and multiple fan configurations, profiles, and fan curves.\nBe aware that if you set your fan speeds too low, you may overheat your PC. So monitor temperatures carefully.\nDownload Speedfan from the official website and install it like you would any other program.\nSpend some time getting to grips with the application.

If it’s working correctly, you should see the RPM increase or decrease and hear your PC get louder or quieter, respectively.\nStandalone fan controllers can give you more tangible controls. Some, like the Thermaltake Commander FT, gives you touchscreen controls for your system’s various fans, where others have physical knobs and dials you can use to control them.\nYou’ll need to follow the included instructions for those, as their setup and management are unique to their respective designs.\nDo You Need Windows 10 Fan Control? If your PC is working just fine and you’re happy with how loud its fans are, you don’t need to adjust your CPU fan settings. Controlling the CPU fan speed in your PC (or all the fans, in fact) is a way to give you more control over your Windows 10 experience. You can make sure that the system isn’t too loud, with the fan only spinning up faster when your PC gets warm. Or you can have it cranking away at full tilt all the time to make sure your CPU stays cool, potentially giving yourself some headroom to overclock the CPU.\nFan speed control is about choice. If you want it, here’s how to get it.\nHow do I remove the CPU fan? First, you’ll need to remove any ducts or ventilation systems above the CPU fan. Disconnect the fan power wire from the motherboard by pulling on the connector cable, not the wire. Remove the heat sink from the processor by unlatching the clip holding the heat sink in place. This should require little upward force. How do I fix a CPU fan error? To fix a CPU fan error, move your computer somewhere cooler to reduce the effects of overheating. Clean its air vents of any dust and debris, and clean the CPU fan. If you installed the CPU fan yourself, ensure it’s in the correct location. You may need to replace a faulty CPU fan. How do I fix a loud CPU fan? To fix a computer fan that’s loud or making noise, start by cleaning the CPU fan with compressed air while ensuring the computer is upright and powered off. You should also clean the power supply fan and any case fans. You should also check Task Manager for processor-intensive programs that are driving CPU usage beyond its limits.

The fan on it should have a cable that runs away from it.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a quick explainer about those different types:</p><ul><li>Molex connectors take all their power from the PSU. They cannot be dynamically controlled and can only be limited using a resistor cable.3-pin DC connectors also run at full power, but your motherboard can limit the voltage going to them, thereby altering the speed.4-pin PWM (pulse width modulation) can be dynamically controlled by software and hardware very easily.</li></ul><h2 id=control-cpu-fan-in-the-bios>Control CPU Fan in the BIOS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#control-cpu-fan-in-the-bios>#</a></h2><p>The easiest way to adjust CPU fan speed is through the BIOS.</p><p>Every BIOS is different, so instructions may differ from computer to computer, but you need to look for a tab or screen associated with Hardware monitoring. In the screenshot below, it was listed as PC Health Status.</p><p>Look for a section to do with the CPU Fan. Once there, try some of these settings below to see what adjustments you can make.</p><ul><li>Set the fan to your fan type (DC or PWM).Select what mode you want the fan to run at. Examples might include Full speed, Performance, Silent.Set a temperature threshold. Typically you don&rsquo;t want a CPU to go over 70 degrees, so make sure that your fan runs fast once it gets that hot, and preferably starts to spin up quicker at lower temperatures.</li></ul><h2 id=cpu-fan-control-with-speedfan>CPU Fan Control With Speedfan<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cpu-fan-control-with-speedfan>#</a></h2><p>If your motherboard can dynamically control fan speeds, then you may be able to make more in-depth adjustments with Windows software. One of the most popular and long-lasting software suites is Speedfan.</p><ul><li>Download Speedfan from the official website and install it like you would any other program.</li><li>Spend some time getting to grips with the application. It can be a little opaque to start with and certain temperature settings may seem way off (ours recorded a temperature of 97 for &ldquo;Auxtin1&rdquo;) which suggests an erroneous reading because you don&rsquo;t have a temperature sensor there.</li><li>Speedfan is designed to be ubiquitous, so it hits all the bases, even if your system doesn&rsquo;t support it. What that means is that you may see false readings for a number of different types of sensors that are not installed on your computer. Just look for the components that are installed and ignore the others.</li><li>When you feel you&rsquo;re ready to take some control, you can select Automatic fan speed to have Speedfan automatically control your system. Otherwise, select Configure then select the Advanced tab.</li><li>Choose your CPU from the drop down menu. The labelling isn&rsquo;t ideal, so you may need to play around to find the right one for your system.</li><li>Find your CPU fan among the list based on what cable it connects to your motherboard and what port it connects to. Then set that to Manual. Alternatively, if you want to control every fan in your system, set them all to Manual.</li><li>Select OK and head back to the main Speedfan page. Use the arrow keys next to your respective fan(s) to adjust the speed up and down. If it&rsquo;s working correctly, you should see the RPM increase or decrease and hear your PC get louder or quieter, respectively.</li></ul><h2 id=fan-control-in-windows-10-with-a-fan-controller>Fan Control in Windows 10 With a Fan Controller<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#fan-control-in-windows-10-with-a-fan-controller>#</a></h2><p>If you want more control over your CPU fan and other aspects of your system, a fan controller is a good bet. Cases like NZXT&rsquo;s H-series i versions have a built-in link box which gives you software control over your CPU fan in much the same way as Speedfan, but in a more intuitive manner. It also adds support for RGB lighting and multiple fan configurations, profiles, and fan curves.</p><p>Be aware that if you set your fan speeds too low, you may overheat your PC. So monitor temperatures carefully.</p><p>Download Speedfan from the official website and install it like you would any other program.</p><p>Spend some time getting to grips with the application.

If it&rsquo;s working correctly, you should see the RPM increase or decrease and hear your PC get louder or quieter, respectively.</p><p>Standalone fan controllers can give you more tangible controls. Some, like the Thermaltake Commander FT, gives you touchscreen controls for your system&rsquo;s various fans, where others have physical knobs and dials you can use to control them.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll need to follow the included instructions for those, as their setup and management are unique to their respective designs.</p><h2 id=do-you-need-windows-10-fan-control>Do You Need Windows 10 Fan Control?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#do-you-need-windows-10-fan-control>#</a></h2><p>If your PC is working just fine and you&rsquo;re happy with how loud its fans are, you don&rsquo;t need to adjust your CPU fan settings. Controlling the CPU fan speed in your PC (or all the fans, in fact) is a way to give you more control over your Windows 10 experience. You can make sure that the system isn&rsquo;t too loud, with the fan only spinning up faster when your PC gets warm. Or you can have it cranking away at full tilt all the time to make sure your CPU stays cool, potentially giving yourself some headroom to overclock the CPU.</p><p>Fan speed control is about choice. If you want it, here&rsquo;s how to get it.</p><ul><li>How do I remove the CPU fan?</li><li>First, you&rsquo;ll need to remove any ducts or ventilation systems above the CPU fan. Disconnect the fan power wire from the motherboard by pulling on the connector cable, not the wire. Remove the heat sink from the processor by unlatching the clip holding the heat sink in place. This should require little upward force.</li><li>How do I fix a CPU fan error?</li><li>To fix a CPU fan error, move your computer somewhere cooler to reduce the effects of overheating. Clean its air vents of any dust and debris, and clean the CPU fan. If you installed the CPU fan yourself, ensure it&rsquo;s in the correct location. You may need to replace a faulty CPU fan.</li><li>How do I fix a loud CPU fan?</li><li>To fix a computer fan that&rsquo;s loud or making noise, start by cleaning the CPU fan with compressed air while ensuring the computer is upright and powered off. You should also clean the power supply fan and any case fans. You should also check Task Manager for processor-intensive programs that are driving CPU usage beyond its limits.</li></ul><p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to remove any ducts or ventilation systems above the CPU fan.
