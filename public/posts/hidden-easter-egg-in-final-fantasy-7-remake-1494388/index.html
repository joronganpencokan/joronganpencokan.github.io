Among popular game titles, Final Fantasy 7 Remake stands out with its immersive storyline, breathtaking visuals, and challenging gameplay. But did you know that this game has a hidden Easter egg that can bring your gaming experience to another level? It’s time to unearth this secret and unleash your inner gamer. Follow this guide, and you will discover the tricks to access this hidden gem.\nStep 1: Reach the Secret Area\nThe first step to finding the Easter egg is to reach the secret area. You need to have access to Chapter 13 - A Way Out to proceed. In this chapter, you will play as Cloud, who will have new moves and weapons. Your primary objective is to escape from a high-security underground prison. However, you will encounter a room with numbers written on its walls. You need to memorize these numbers for future use.\nStep 2: The Puzzle Challenge\nAfter leaving the prison, you will find a green glowing door with a keypad lock. This door leads to a secret area where the Easter egg is waiting for you. To unlock the door, you need to input the numbers you saw on the walls earlier: 4, 36, 22, 9.\nOnce you input the code, the lock will open, and you will enter a room with a puzzle challenge. In this challenge, you will face a hologram of the famous Sephiroth. You need to use your instincts and strategies to outsmart Sephiroth and solve the puzzle. Once you complete the puzzle, you will receive your reward: a summoning materia that lets you call the powerful Cactuar to aid you in battle.\nStep 3: Unleash Your Inner Gamer\nNow that you have the Cactuar summoning materia, you can incorporate it into your gameplay and unleash your inner gamer. The Cactuar summon is a unique ability that deals massive damage to enemies, making it a powerful weapon in your arsenal. You can summon Cactuar during battles, and it will bring a smile to your face to see the adorable, spiky cactus dealing destruction to your foes.\nConclusion:\nThe Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a game that provides endless entertainment, excitement, and challenges for gamers worldwide. By following our guide and unearthing the hidden Easter egg, you will discover a new level of gaming experience. The Cactuar summon will add a unique and exciting touch to your battles, making the game even more fun and enjoyable. So, what are you waiting for? Grab your controller, enter Chapter 13 - A Way Out, and discover the secret Easter egg for yourself. Unleash your inner gamer and let the adventure begin!\nThere are many crazy fan theories about Final Fantasy games but this one seems to be quite believable. As revealed by VG247 around the release of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, there might be an Easter egg hinting at an interesting connection between two Final Fantasy games. Minor spoilers for Final Fantasy 7 Remake ahead.\nThe Easter egg in question is about a young scientist from Final Fantasy X-2. In, Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania GuideBook, Kazushige Nojima, who is the scenario writer of Final Fantasy VII, X and X-2, has commented about this young scientist who would become the founder of a big corporation in Final Fantasy VII. The scientist could be Shinra, who heads the Shinra Corporation as we know it.\nThis speculation is further strengthened by the fact that Shinra talks about harnessing the power of the Farplane to use it as an energy source in Final Fantasy X-2. Although there is not a great level of continuity in Final Fantasy games, this hidden Easter egg hints at Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy X existing as a part of the same universe.\nAdding more fuel to this theory is a photo you see in FF7 Remake. As you enter the museum inside the Shinra Headquarters, you will see an old sepia-toned photo. It’s a group photo of Shinra employees outside the Shinra factory. If you look closely, there is a man wearing a mask sitting in the front row. Check out this tweet by AllGamesDelta:\nAn easter egg in FFVII Remake officially connects the game’s universe to Final Fantasy X-2\nCheck out this group photo of the founders of Shinra Corp. Look who’s sitting right in the middlehttps://t.co/U6MlePTJe9 pic.twitter.com/9FVvVwWutO\n— AllGamesDelta (@AllGamesDelta_) April 8, 2020\nSuspiciously, It looks quite a bit like the mask worn by Final Fantasy X-2’s AI Bhed named, you guessed it, Shinra. Developer Yoshinori Kitase has mentioned that this connection is more of Kazushige Nojima’s ‘secret history’ which involves Shinra’s descendants going on to founding the Shinra Corporation. Nojima has previously suggested that the events of Final Fantasy 7 occur thousands of years later.\nIt is unknown if these theories are true or if Square Enix is just sprinkling this reference for all the theorists. It’s likely that it is just an Easter egg and doesn’t hold much greater meaning in the world of Final Fantasy.\n","wordCount":"867","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Melba Sanderson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/hidden-easter-egg-in-final-fantasy-7-remake-1494388/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unearth the Secret Easter Egg in Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Unleash Your Inner Gamer!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 17, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;867 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Melba Sanderson</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Title: Unearth the Secret Easter Egg in Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Unleash Your Inner Gamer!</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Playing video games is one of the modern hobbies that bring people into a fantastic world of adventure, challenge, and fun.
