Do you wish to make it look more personalized and unique but did not know where to begin? You are in luck because we have got just the solution for you. In this article, we will guide you through the simple and easy steps to install custom themes and give your GNOME shell a completely new look.\nFirstly, let us understand what GNOME shell is. GNOME shell is the graphical user interface of the GNOME desktop environment, which is the default desktop environment for many Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian. It is what you see when you log in to your desktop, and it includes the panels, menus, and visual effects.\nNow, let us look at how to install custom themes in GNOME shell:\nStep 1: Download a GNOME shell theme from a reliable source such as gnome-look.org, which offers a wide range of custom themes that you can choose from.\nStep 2: Extract the downloaded archive to a folder. You can use the Archive Manager to extract the files.\nStep 3: Move the extracted files to the ~/.themes directory. If this directory does not exist, you can create it by pressing Ctrl+H to show hidden files and folders in your home directory, and then creating a new folder called “.themes”.\nStep 4: Activate the new theme. To do this, launch the GNOME Tweak Tool, which is a graphical tool for customizing GNOME. If you do not have it installed, you can install it from your distribution’s software repository. Once installed, open GNOME Tweak Tool and go to the Appearance tab. Under the Shell Theme section, select the new theme that you have installed.\nStep 5: Enjoy the new look of your GNOME shell! You can further customize the theme by adjusting the settings available in GNOME Tweak Tool.\nIt is that simple! By following these easy steps, you can give your GNOME shell a completely unique and personalized look. Customizing your desktop environment is not just about aesthetics but can also improve productivity as it helps you feel more comfortable and at home when using your computer.\nIn conclusion, we hope that this article helped you understand how easy it is to install custom themes on GNOME shell. You can now explore and experiment with different themes until you find the one that suits you the best. So go on and start customizing your GNOME shell today!\nIt used to be very easy to install custom themes in Gnome 2, but if you have upgraded to Gnome Shell, particularly in Ubuntu Oneiric, you will find that there are not much customization options available for you. While Gnome Shell supports theming, there doesn’t seem to be an option for you to switch to the theme you want. For those who are tired of the default look in your Gnome Shell, here is how you can easily install and switch to a custom theme.\nGet your themes ready! Before we can switch theme, you need to have your custom themes ready. Places you can look for beautiful themes include Gnome-look and DeviantArt.\nThere are a few themes that you have to download, namely the Gnome Shell theme, GTK 3.x theme, icon theme and probably custom font (optional).\nIn case you are confused over the difference between the Gnome Shell theme and the GTK 3.x theme:\nGTK 3.x theme – the main theme that governs the panel/window border, color, background etc Gnome shell theme – the theme that governs the display in the Activity mode (when you click on the Activity button at the top left corner). Popular Gnome Shell Theme Here are some popular Gnome Shell themes:\nFaience\nDownload link\nAdwaita-White\nNote: The Adwaita GTK theme is the default theme for Gnome Shell in Ubuntu Oneiric. This Adwaita White Gnome Shell theme will go well with the default theme.\nLondon Smoke\nTron Legacy\nDownload link\nInstalling themes Once you have downloaded all the themes (Gnome Shell theme, GTK 3 theme, icon theme, and probably custom fonts), extract them to their respective location.\nExtract Gnome shell theme and GTK 3 theme to ~/.themes Extract icon theme to ~/.icons Extract custom font to ~/.fonts Note: ~/ is a shorthand for your home folder. So ~/.themes is referring to the /home/username/.themes folder.\nSwitching theme There are many ways to change a theme in Gnome Shell, but the easiest way is via the third-party application Gnome Tweak Tool.\nInstall Gnome Tweak Tool (for Ubuntu Oneiric):\nNext, open the Gnome Tweak Tool (search for “Advanced Settings”). On the left pane, click “Shell Extensions”.\nEnable the “User Themes Extension” option.\nNext, click the Theme option. Here, you can select your favourite Gnome Shell theme, GTK 3 theme and Icon theme (for a consistent look, keep the Window theme the same as the GTK+ theme).\nLastly, go to the Fonts option and change the default font to your custom font.\nThat’s it.\nWhat is your favourite Gnome Shell theme?\nDamien Oh started writing tech articles since 2007 and has over 10 years of experience in the tech industry.
