The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we work, and companies around the globe are adapting by conducting remote interviews. Although remote interviews may seem daunting, they can also bring a new level of convenience and flexibility to both job seekers and employers. With the right mindset and preparation, you can master the art of remote interviews and land your dream job. Here are some expert tips to help you ace your remote interview:\nPrepare Your Environment Before your remote interview, make sure that you choose a quiet, comfortable space where you will not be disturbed. Check your internet connection to ensure that it is stable and has a good signal. Test your camera and microphone to make sure that they are working properly. Additionally, make sure that there is adequate lighting and that you dress appropriately for the occasion.\nTest Your Technology Technology can be fickle, and glitches can occur unexpectedly. To avoid technical issues during your remote interview, practice beforehand. Conduct a mock interview with a friend or family member to test your connection, camera, and microphone. Even if your equipment is working well, it’s still essential to have a backup plan if your technology fails during your interview. Have a phone number, email address, or messaging platform available to contact your interviewer in case of any technical difficulties.\nPrepare Your Thoughts Traditional interviews and remote interviews have a lot in common: you need to be prepared to articulate your strengths, experience, and expertise during the interview. To improve your preparedness, research the company and its culture prior to your interview. Review the job description carefully, and study up on your potential employer and competitors. Additionally, you should prepare responses for potential questions and anecdotes highlighting your accomplishments.\nCommunicate Clearly Effective communication is key to any interview, and remote interviews are no exception. You must accurately communicate your opinions, your expertise, and your personality to your interviewer. Speak clearly and concisely, and avoid words or phrases you might use in informal settings. Additionally, pay attention to any questions asked of you and listen carefully to the interviewer’s answers to your questions.\nShow Your Personality Although remote interviews take place in a virtual setting, you should still strive to connect with your interviewer on a personal level. Be friendly, personable, and find ways to inject your personality into your responses. Remember, your interviewer wants to know why they should choose you for the job - think beyond your qualifications and credentials.\nBy following these expert tips, you can master the art of remote interviews and land your dream job. Preparation, communication, and a bit of personality can go a long way in securing the job of your dreams. With practice and perseverance, you’ll be sure to make a lasting impression on your next remote interview.\nNow that we’ve been operating remotely for a while, many employers have seen the positive benefits of having remote employees. Increased productivity is one of them. Many companies have decided to stay that way, so much that your next interview could be over Zoom. Don’t panic! We’ve got you covered. Here’s how to prepare for a remote interview over the phone or on video, brought to you by our sponsor, LinkedIn. Is your business hiring? LinkedIn is the easiest, fastest way to find qualified candidates. Tap or click here to post a job for free.\nDouble-check everything You wouldn’t show up to an in-person interview 10-15 minutes late, would you? Being on time is just as important for a virtual interview as in person. Showing up late looks unprofessional, which won’t help you score points with the person interviewing you. RELATED: Working from home? Eight tips for managing remote employees First, double-check your internet connection to ensure it’s stable before the interview. Run a speed test to be sure. Try the FCC’s speed test to ensure your internet is working fast enough to support your interview, whatever platform it may be on. Second, double-check you have the software needed to run the interview. If your remote interview is over Zoom, you’ll need to download the software first. Don’t wait until 10 minutes before your interview! Be sure you know how to use Zoom, or you may end up like this poor guy in this famous Zoom mishap. Finally, ensure all your equipment is working. Ensure your laptop is charged or plugged in before starting the meeting. Do a microphone check and video cam check to make sure everything is running smoothly, so there won’t be any hiccups during the session.\nDon’t assume your call is audio-only and dress accordingly Just like you wouldn’t show up to your interview late because punctuality is important, you wouldn’t show up to an interview in sweatpants either. Don’t assume your interview will be audio-only, even if it is over the phone. Dress like you would for a typical interview and look as professional as possible. If your interview is over Google Meets or Zoom, it’s important to consider your background and surrounding environment. Look for a neutral background, so nothing is distracting. If you live with others, ask them to leave the apartment or go into another room so you won’t have any disturbances. If you have pets, lock them up so they won’t bother you during the interview.\nHave a backup option What happens if your laptop fails during your interview? What if it breaks the hour before? Consider a backup solution before the day of your interview, just on the chance that a worst-case scenario happens. This may be as simple as downloading Zoom onto your phone if your laptop decides to go E.T. and phone home on the day of your remote interview.\nBe prepared to take notes Remote interviews are just like in-person ones. They are likely to throw a lot of information your way. Be prepared! Employers appreciate that. It looks like you didn’t expect anything of importance when you have to get up to get a paper and pen. Have them ready and by your side. Better yet, use them. It looks good to employers when you take notes. It shows you like to be prepared and are interested in what they have to say.\nLook into the camera You wouldn’t avoid eye contact in person, would you? Of course not. A camera is no different. Make eye contact with your employer throughout the conversation, and respond when they are talking. Avoid fidgeting or moving around. You don’t want to look too distracted.\nResearch the company beforehand Many remote interview tips are the same as in-person interview tips. That’s because simple skills like being punctual, appearing professional and being prepared matter in every environment. Before you log on to meet with your potential employer, research their company and understand what it stands for. You’ll want to be prepared for any possible questions they may throw your way, and they may ask you about the company to see if you’ll be prepared. All it takes is a few minutes of research to nail any questions they have to ask. With remote work likely here to stay, your next interview could very well be a video chat instead of an in-person meeting. These tips will help you look like a rockstar, no matter where you are interviewing.\nHire the best talent, the easy way If you’re a business owner looking for talented workers, LinkedIn has your back. Once you post your job on the world’s largest professional network, you can get matched with qualified candidates almost immediately. LinkedIn even lets you know which people would be perfect — even if they haven’t applied yet. What are you waiting for?
