Download it for free and start managing your partitions like a pro. You won’t believe how easy it is!\nGParted is a free disk partitioning tool that runs from outside of the operating system, meaning that you don’t need an OS installed to use it, nor will you ever have to reboot to apply any changes.\nAmong other things, you can delete, format, resize, copy, and hide any partition recognized by GParted.\nGParted Pros \u0026 Cons There’s very little to dislike about the GParted disk management tool:\nMore About GParted Data on one partition can be copied to any other partition, even one on a different physical drive Resizing a partition is simple with GParted because you can either resize it by sliding the space left and right for a smaller or larger partition or simply enter the size in manually Supports formatting to lots of different file systems, including common ones like NTFS, FAT, EXT, and HFS, but also less common ones like XFS, F2FS, BTRFS, JFS, Reiser4, and NILFS2 Lets you change the volume label Can create a new partition table; options include: aix, amiga, bsd, dvh, gpt, mac, msdos, pc98, sun, and loop You can manage the flag for a device, with these options: boot, diag, esp, hidden, irst, lba, lvm, palo, prep, and raid Drive error checking is supported A data recovery option can attempt to recover files by letting you copy them to other media On the main menu, when you first boot to GParted, there’s an option to run a free memory test with the included MemTest86+ tool How to Install GParted GParted must be properly extracted to a disc or a flash drive before you can use it. Get started by visiting the download page to get the ISO file. The download is the first link below the “Stable Releases” section.\nHas a familiar graphical interface that’s easy to use.\nDoesn’t require an operating system.\nNever requires a reboot to commit changes.\nQueues all changes until you’re ready to apply them.\nRelatively large download size.\nCan only be used after burning it to a disc or USB device.\nCan’t redo changes (only undo).\nSee How to Burn an ISO Image File to a DVD if you plan on using GParted from a disc, or How to Burn an ISO File to a USB Drive if you plan on using it from a USB device like a flash drive. One isn’t better than the other—it’s your choice.\nAfter GParted has been installed, you must then boot from it before the operating system starts up. If you’re not sure how to do that, see this tutorial for how to boot from a disc, or this one for instructions on booting from a USB device.\nOnce you’ve booted from your GParted disc or USB device, choose the first option called GParted Live (Default Settings). Most of you should be fine choosing Don’t touch keymap on the next screen you see.\nYou’ll then need to choose your language. The default is set to English, so just press the Enter key to continue, or you can choose a different language from the list. Finally, press Enter once more to start using GParted.\nThoughts on GParted We like disk partition programs like GParted because they work regardless of the operating system you’re using so that you can be running Linux, Windows, or a brand new hard drive with nothing installed yet.\nThe fact that GParted supports lots of file systems makes it one of the most versatile disk partition programs we’ve ever used. It’s always nice to see a software developer put the time and energy into features that only a few people might use but no doubt save the day for those couple of users.\nHowever, some things are clearly missing in GParted that we’ve seen in similar programs, like the ability to migrate an installed operating system to a different drive. However, as far as regular partitioning actions, like resizing and formatting, most things are well supported, making GParted a great choice for most.\nAlso, while we don’t think it’s a huge concern, we do find it odd that you can’t redo the changes you’ve made. GParted queues everything you want to do and only applies them when you decide to save them. You can undo any of these operations before you commit to them, but if you accidentally undo it, you can’t redo it. Again, it’s not a major issue at all, but of the programs we’ve seen that support undoing, they also let you redo changes.\nOverall, we think GParted is the best bootable disk partition program we’ve used, mostly because it provides a full user interface like you’d find in any Windows-based tool.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1227","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-06T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kevin Bearce"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/gparted-v1-4-0-6-review-free-partition-manager-tool-472263/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Manage Your Partitions with Gparted V1 4 0 6 - Our Honest Review of This Free Tool Will Shock You!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 6, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1227 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Kevin Bearce</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#gparted-pros--cons>GParted Pros & Cons</a></li><li><a href=#more-about-gparted>More About GParted</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-install-gparted>How to Install GParted</a></li><li><a href=#thoughts-on-gparted>Thoughts on GParted</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Title: You Won&rsquo;t Believe How Easy It Is to Manage Your Partitions with Gparted V1 4 0 6 - Our Honest Review of This Free Tool Will Shock You!</p><p>Are you tired of struggling to manage your partitions?
