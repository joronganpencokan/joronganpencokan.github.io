It can happen due to various reasons such as power outages, system crashes, abrupt shutdowns or even malware attacks. When you try to open the file again, you may get error messages like “Could not complete your request because the file is not compatible with this version of Photoshop” or “Unexpected end-of-file encountered”. You may spend hours or even days creating your artwork or design, and losing it due to a file corruption can be simply devastating.\nHowever, there is hope. Thanks to modern technology, there is a miracle tool that can repair and recover corrupted Photoshop files in a few clicks! It’s called the Stellar Repair for Photo software, and it’s a lifesaver for anyone who values their time, effort and creativity.\nHere’s how it works:\nStep 1: Download and install the software on your computer (it’s available for both Windows and Mac platforms).\nStep 2: Open the software and select “Add File” option to browse and add the corrupted Photoshop file that you want to repair.\nStep 3: Click on the “Repair” button and wait for the software to scan and analyze the file for any errors or damages.\nStep 4: Once the scan is complete, the software will show you a preview of the repaired file. You can compare it with the original file and see the differences.\nStep 5: If you’re satisfied with the results, click on the “Save” button to save the repaired file on your computer. You can also choose a different location or format for the file if you want.\nThat’s it! Your corrupted Photoshop file is now repaired and recovered, thanks to the Stellar Repair for Photo software. You can open it again in Photoshop and continue working on it as usual, without losing any of your precious data, layers or effects. It’s like a magic wand that saves your sanity and revives your lost artwork!\nSome of the key features of Stellar Repair for Photo software are:\nAdvanced algorithms that can repair multiple layers, color modes, and file formats (PSD, BMP, PNG, JPEG, etc.) Preview option that lets you see the repaired file before saving it Batch repair option that can fix multiple files at once User-friendly interface that requires no technical skills or expertise So, if you’re tired of losing your artwork due to frustrating Photoshop file corruptions, give Stellar Repair for Photo software a try. It’s a small investment that can save you a lot of time, money and headaches in the long run. Don’t let file corruptions ruin your creative passion and productivity. Use the miracle tool that fixes your corrupted Photoshop files and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with it!\nThis is a sponsored article and was made possible by Recovery Toolbox. The actual contents and opinions are the sole views of the author who maintains editorial independence even when a post is sponsored.\nAdmittedly, it doesn’t happen every day, but Photoshop files can become corrupted. Maybe your antivirus or firewall software mistakenly identifies a file as a threat. Perhaps the power went out halfway through saving, or an elderly hard drive hiccupped in the middle of a disk operation. Or loading and saving big files resulted in a truncated save. If you use some kind of file format interchange, your legacy versions of Photoshop may cough on things like smart objects.\nWhatever the reason, sometimes a PSD file just goes rogue and doesn’t open. What should you do?\nRehab for PSD Files PSD Repair Kit is a single-trick utility which takes corrupted files and turns them into something you can not just open again, but you can use and resave.\nIt’s simple to just choose your mangled file, then examine the file and determine which layers are causing problems with opening.\nYou can visually examine each layer in the file using the Picture tab to see which is which if you don’t properly rename your layers. Yes, we all do it, but this is another good reason why explicitly naming layers is a good idea. Write that down!\nWhen you’re done checking and unchecking layers to be included, then you can try a repair. This can take a while depending on the size of your file, but there is a progress bar to let you know roughly how long it will take.\nAfter that you can save the new file and even preview it directly in Photoshop. It’s simple and quick.\nYou can also try out the online version of the software at the linked website to upload and repair your PSD files. This works with all OS, including Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, etc. All you have to do is select a file, give your email address, complete a captcha, and then you can upload a file for repair.\nThe online service is cheaper than the program, costing only $10 per file. So if you are only looking to repair one Photoshop file, it would benefit you to do do so online, rather than purchase the program.\nWhy would I want it? At one end of the scale if you are a hobbyist, having mangled files is usually just an annoyance. But if you’ve worked on a piece over many days, it can be a catastrophe. At the top end, if you work professionally either full time or part time on Photoshop for clients, a corrupted file could mean losing a job or a contract.\nAlso, if you are using an older version of Photoshop (and lots of people do despite the really annoying Adobe Genuine Software popups which erroneously say they are invalid), then your tech support has long ago expired. If so, then PSD Repair Kit is a godsend.\nFor and against As for the pros and cons, in the plus column the software works with modern and legacy versions of Photoshop from version 3.0 and above and works with both PSD and 8BPS files. In fact, in general it’s very legacy-friendly and runs on Windows 98, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 and 10.\nAnother useful feature is that not only can you repair the PSD file, but you can also separate each layer of the PSD as a single JPG. This is handy if you can’t get it to work as a layered file. It’s a rarity but happens, and any extra options you can get to repair your file are all good.\nIn the minus column? Not that much, actually, because while it’s a single function piece of software and is a bit of a one-trick pony, it does that single job very well. It’s not pretty to look at, but personally we’d prefer that utilities are plain and simple tools and leave the pretty pictures to Photoshop.\nAll in all, PSD Repair Kit is a simple-to-use, effective piece of insurance for anyone who works with Photoshop, no matter how professionally and no matter how antediluvian and crumbly your old Photoshop is. In fact, the older your version number, the more likely this utility is to give you peace of mind.\nAnd you’re off! You can get the software PSD Repair Kit and try it for free. To buy it for personal use, it’s $27 and for business use it’s $45. For a small solid utility that does the trick and might save you from losing a job, it’s worth the price.\nPhil South has been writing about tech subjects for over 30 years.
