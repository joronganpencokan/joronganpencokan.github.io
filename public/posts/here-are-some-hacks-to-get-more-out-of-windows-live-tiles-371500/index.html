Windows has offered a range of features and tools, which can help its users enhance their productivity, including Windows live tiles. These tiles are a remarkable feature that helps users customize and manage their desktops according to their preferences. With these mind-blowing Windows Live Tile hacks, you can double your productivity and save time.\nUse Live Tiles to Stay Connected with Your Team If you are a team leader or a member of a team, staying connected with your team is essential. Using Windows live tiles, you can stay up-to-date with your team members and track their progress. You can add live tiles of your team members or project management systems to your desktop, which will help you stay on top of your game.\nCreate Live Tiles for Your Email, Calendar, and To-Do List Email, calendar, and to-do list are essential tools that help users manage their schedule and keep track of their tasks. Creating live tiles for these tools is an excellent way to stay organized and manage your time effectively. You can customize these tiles by adding colors, reminders, and other features that suit your needs.\nAdd News Feeds to Your Live Tiles Keeping up with the latest news and updates can be time-consuming, but it’s crucial in today’s world. By adding news feeds to your live tiles, you can stay informed without having to visit various websites or applications. You can choose news feeds that interest you the most and stay up-to-date without losing focus on your work.\nUse Live Tiles for Social Media Social media can be a distracting tool, but it’s also an essential platform for many businesses and professionals. By adding live tiles for social media apps such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, etc., you can stay on top of your social media accounts without losing focus on your work.\nCustomize Your Live Tiles Customizing your live tiles is an excellent way to personalize your desktop and make it more fun and enjoyable. You can add photos, stickers, logos, and other graphics to your tiles, making your desktop an extension of your personality.\nIn conclusion, using Windows Live Tiles can help you streamline your workflow, and with these hacks, you can double your productivity. So, start customizing your desktop according to your preference and watch how it makes a significant impact on your productivity level.\nFor a long time I’ve been neglecting Windows Live Tiles. While I was grateful to have seen their presence shrunk in Windows 10 from the screen-filling fuscia splatter that they were in Windows 8, I still didn’t really have much use for them, even though they were there every time I clicked the Start button in Windows.\nSeeing as I couldn’t outright get rid of the Live Tiles (or rather, I couldn’t be bothered to right-click and “Unpin from Start” every single tile in order to make the section disappear completely), I decided to customize them and make them work for me. Here are a few hacks to make Live Tiles useful for people – like me – who usually find them useless.\nTurn Your Favorite Websites into Live Tiles The bookmarks bar in your browser is all well and good, but wouldn’t it be so much better if you could access your favorite sites right from the Start menu? Of course it would.\nFrom Google Chrome\nTo grab a website from Chrome and turn it into a Live Tile, open the site, click the three-dotted menu icon at the top right -\u003e More tools, then “Add to desktop.”\nThat site should now appear as a thumbnail on your desktop but also under “Recently added” in the Start menu. In the Start menu you can now drag it over to the Live Tiles section. Unfortunately, the site icon doesn’t translate over to the live tiles, so you’re left with a generic Chrome icon instead.\nIf you want the actual site logo instead, then you’ll need to use the following.\nMicrosoft Edge\nYep, in order to get site icons, you’ll need to pin websites to your Start menu from Microsoft’s own browser. Open the website you want on Edge, click the menu icon at the top right, “Pin this page to Start,” then drag it over from “Recently added” to the Tiles section.\nAdd Gmail, Google Calendar and More as Live Tiles By default, the Calendar and Mail apps will prompt you to link your Windows account, which will then show up in your Live Tiles. But you can link your Gmail, or any other email account, to your Live Tiles instead.\nOpen the Windows Mail app, click “Accounts” in the pane on the left, then in the pane on the right click “Add account.” Enter all your details. When you’re done, your alternative email address should appear in the pane on the left under “Accounts.” Right-click it, click “Pin to Start,” and there it will be!\nIf this is a Gmail account, then “Gmail” should also automatically appear in the Windows “Calendar” app. To add your Google Calendar as a Live Tile, click the Start menu, type “Calendar,” right-click the Windows app, then click “Pin to Start.” Unlike with the Gmail app, info from within your Google Calendar will appear in the Live Tile.\nAdd Games to Windows Live Tiles Instead of booting up Steam to load up your favorite games or cluttering up your desktop with their icons, why not have them appear as Live Tiles, complete with live achievements information and your playtime. The Windows Store app Steam Tile does just that. Bear in mind that you’ll need to have your Steam ID handy and your Steam profile set to “Public” for this to work.\nOnce you start pinning your games to your Start menu, you might need to scroll down to find their icons. If they’re squares, right-click them and resize them to “Wide,” as that’s their native size, then organize them how you would like. If you don’t want to see the live achievements, etc., just right-click the tile More, then “Turn live tile off.”\nRemember that just above each section of live tiles you can click the empty space to create a title for it, which helps keep them organized.\nConclusion Maybe those Windows Live Tiles aren’t completely useless after all. Of course, if you really can’t stand them, you can always remove them one by one, then drag your Start menu in to go back to its more traditional look.\nHow are you finding Live Tiles? Found any benefits to them that we haven’t mentioned? Let us know in the comment section below.\nContent Manager at Make Tech Easier.
