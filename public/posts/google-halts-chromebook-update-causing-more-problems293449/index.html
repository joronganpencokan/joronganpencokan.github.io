The latest update was supposed to be released on Monday, but due to some unforeseen issues, Google had to suspend the update. This has left users in a helpless and frustrated state.\nGoogle’s Chromebook update was going to bring changes and improvements to the operating system. The update was set to include a new launcher, a redesigned app launcher, and a new settings menu, among other things. These features were highly anticipated by Chromebook users, who were eagerly waiting for the update to be released.\nHowever, Google stated that the issues encountered were serious and that the update could not be released until those issues were resolved. This announcement has left users questioning the reliability of Google’s software updates and their leadership in the technology industry. The lack of transparency and communication from Google has further instilled fear and uncertainty in users.\nMany users took to social media platforms to express their frustration and disappointment with the update’s suspension. Some users reported that their Chromebooks had not been working correctly since the update was supposed to be released. This has left users stuck with a faulty device and no clear timeline for when the issues will be addressed.\nAdditionally, many users also reported that they were not informed of the suspension or given any updates on the status of the update. This lack of communication and transparency from Google has left many users feeling neglected and devalued.\nThe suspension of Google’s Chromebook update has highlighted the importance of transparency, communication, and reliability in the technology industry. Users need to trust technology companies to provide them with updates that will improve their devices’ functionality and not cause more problems.\nIn conclusion, Google’s suspension of the Chromebook update has caused massive chaos and left users feeling helpless and frustrated. The lack of transparency and communication from Google has also raised serious concerns about the reliability of their software updates. It is vital for technology companies to prioritize communication and transparency to build trust with their users and avoid similar situations in the future.\nThe most recent update for Google’s Chromebooks was causing Chrome OS to slow down, but after the update was halted users noticed that they no longer can install Linux on their machines.\nChrome OS 91’s most recent update, version 91.0.4472.147, began slowing performance on Chromebook laptops, leading to Google pulling the update for the time being. Unfortunately, rolling back to a previous version (91.0.4472.114) has created a new problem. As reported by Chrome Unboxed, this change has broken the Linux container and will prevent attempts at installing Linux.\nIt seems the issue is tied to the version update process, itself. Since the 91.0.4472.147 update no longer appears as the latest version, users who are running or have reverted to 91.0.4472.114 will be told they have the latest version installed. This won’t cause problems by itself, however if you try to install Linux you’ll be told you need to update Chrome OS—and then you’ll be told you’re already running the latest version.\nChrome Unboxed goes on to report that Google has made fixing the 91.0.4472.147 a priority 1 bug, so a fix is definitely planned, but so far there’s no estimate for how long it will take. It’s also unclear if Google is aware of or plans on addressing the broken Linux container issue, or if the plan is to let it sort itself out when version 91.0.4472.147 is available again.\nIf you need to use Linux apps, Chrome Unboxed recommends using a Chromebook machine that either already has Linux enabled, or already has been updated to version 91.0.4472.147. If neither of those options is available, you’ll probably have to wait for Google to sort the problem out.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"656","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bryan Patch"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/google-halts-chromebook-update-causing-more-problems293449/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Massive Chaos Unveiled as Google Halts Chromebook Update - Users Left Helpless & Frustrated!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 20, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;656 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Bryan Patch</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Massive Chaos Unveiled as Google Halts Chromebook Update - Users Left Helpless & Frustrated!</p><p>Google&rsquo;s Chromebook update has been halted, and users are left in a state of massive chaos.
