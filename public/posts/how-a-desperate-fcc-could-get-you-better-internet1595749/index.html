According to insiders privy to the project, the FCC is designing a groundbreaking technology that would provide lightning-fast internet speeds to Americans across the country.\nThe internet is practically ubiquitous in the modern world, permeating every aspect of our daily lives. However, the effectiveness of this technology is often stymied by slow connections, leading to frustration and inefficiencies. This problem has worsened over the years, with COVID-19 only revealing the extent of the internet issues in America.\nThe FCC’s plan involves the use of a new technology, allegedly called “FastNet,” which would provide high-speed and high-capacity internet access to all Americans. FastNet would leverage billions of dollars in funding and private partnerships to provide universal internet access faster than we could ever imagine.\nThe Federal Communications Commission has experienced its fair share of hiccups and controversies over the years. However, the potential for FastNet to totally revolutionize the internet landscape can’t be understated. Many people have questioned the need for such technology, but with the growing demand for remote work, telemedicine, and online education, unlimited high-speed internet access has become imperative.\nThe FCC has gone to great lengths to keep the FastNet project under wraps. The design of the technology involves complex algorithms and extensive research in emerging technologies such as 6G. The technology’s infrastructure would come with intuitive design, making it user friendly for the average person.\nThe project’s funding is expected to come from existing partnerships and a new national infrastructure fund, which looks at expanding the country’s broadband network while also providing reliable internet access to unserved regions.\nAs with any big technological leap, FastNet is not without its detractors. Some are concerned about the cost of implementing this project, while others argue that the existing broadband network in America is already sufficient. However, the potential benefits of FastNet can’t be overlooked.\nIf the FastNet project becomes a reality, Americans could finally say goodbye to slow internet connections and buffering videos. Businesses could improve their operations, providing cost-effective remote work solutions that could save the company’s operational cost. Similarly, schools could offer online education sessions without worrying about connectivity issues affecting learning.\nIn conclusion, the FastNet project is a high-stakes venture that could change the internet landscape in America forever. The FCC has gone to great lengths to keep the project under wraps, but the potential benefits of high-speed, high-capacity internet could transform industries such as telemedicine, remote work, education, and more. We will wait and see what FastNet brings, but the FCC’s plan is certainly one to watch in the coming months.\nExperts say that the FCC’s recent attempts at crowdsourcing internet coverage data is an act of desperation as it fights to close the broadband divide.\nKey Takeaways\nThe FCC is now pushing for users to download and test their internet using its official internet speed test app.Experts say that the recent attempts to gain internet coverage data are a shot in the dark, but could provide cleaner information than ISP reporting.Some experts believe the FCC is now pushing for consumer interaction because of past issues with ISPs inflating their coverage numbers. The Federal Communications Commission recently has started pushing for users to provide information about their internet data speeds, even going so far as to release an app that you can use to measure your home internet connection.\nMuch of this move, experts say, is fueled by the FCC’s desperate attempts to provide more open and transparent information about the current broadband performance throughout the United States. “The FCC has resorted to crowdsourcing broadband speed data out of complete desperation,” Tom Paton, founder of BroadbandSavvy, told Lifewire in an email. “Without a significant regulatory overhaul, they have no way of verifying what speeds are available at every address in America, handicapping their ability to help people who are stuck with slow internet.”\nError and Inflation For years now, the FCC has relied on internet service providers (ISPs) to provide information about the country’s bandwidth. There are some problems with this method, though.\n“There is no law specifying that these measurements must be made using a certain methodology. There is no requirement for ISPs to report on how they actually measure broadband speeds, and the FCC does not audit the data—it basically takes ISPs at their word.” Paton explained.\nThe issue with taking ISPs at their word? Many of them have inflated their coverage numbers to make it look like they provide better speeds to neighborhoods than they actually do. Instead of breaking down the measurements more clearly, ISPs previously based their reports by zip code.\nThis meant that the ISPs could take entire neighborhoods and measure their connectivity based on the best connection in the area—even if it only went to one house.\nPerhaps one of the most prominent examples of the inflation that ISPs have used to bolster their coverage was when BarrierFree provided massively incorrect data to the FCC, claiming to have provided broadband services to more than 62 million users.\nThe inflated numbers were branded an error by the ISP, but with no real audit process in place, data like this has the potential to slip through and make its way into official reports.\nThere is no requirement for ISPs to report on how they actually measure broadband speeds, and the FCC does not audit the data.\nPaton says that although similar accusations have been levied against some of the more major ISPs in the country, this was one of the most egregious cases.\nThe primary way ISPs measure broadband coverage was updated in 2019, but other problems with the measurement system come from ISPs pushing the FCC to omit slower data speeds during reports.\nAnd Paton claims that the new system still allows ISPs to inflate coverage information by focusing on their advertised maximum speeds, despite the average speeds often being much slower.\nA Shot in the Dark? With so much attention focused on closing the broadband divide, it makes sense for the FCC to look into other methods of gathering the data it needs. Unfortunately, Paton says this data still suffers from some inconsistencies.\n“The creation of the FCC speed testing app is a shot in the dark because the data it reports back to the FCC could be affected by any number of factors influencing an individual’s internet speed at the time they run the test,” he told us.\nThere are a lot of variables to take into account when testing your internet speeds. Are you using Wi-Fi or are you hardwired? Is the connection to your neighborhood congested by others trying to access the internet when you are?\nIf you test during off-peak hours, you could provide a higher-than-normal speed to the FCC, which could lead to further skewed results. Because there are so many factors affecting your internet speed, Paton believes the FCC will need to clean up the data somehow before it can be used to properly measure broadband coverage. Still, it should provide clearer information than relying on ISPs turning in their own numbers.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1213","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Thomas Moore"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-a-desperate-fcc-could-get-you-better-internet1595749/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Secret FCC Plan to Revolutionize Internet Speeds - Say Goodbye to Slow Connections Forever!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 20, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1213 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Thomas Moore</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#heading></a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#error-and-inflation>Error and Inflation</a></li><li><a href=#a-shot-in-the-dark>A Shot in the Dark?</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>+++ title = &ldquo;Secret FCC Plan to Revolutionize Internet Speeds - Say Goodbye to Slow Connections Forever!&rdquo;</p><p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is working on a top-secret plan that could transform the internet landscape forever.
