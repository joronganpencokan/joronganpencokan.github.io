To find an IP address owner if you don’t know the IP address, use Register.com, GoDaddy, or DomainTools. How to Find Out Who Owns an IP Address Every internet protocol (IP) address used on the internet is registered to an owner. The owner may be an individual or a representative of a larger organization such as an internet service provider. Many websites don’t conceal their ownership, so you can look up this public information to find the owner. However, some services allow the owner to remain anonymous. As a result, their contact information and name are not easily found.\nARIN WHOIS service queries the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) for an IP address and displays who owns the IP address and other information such as a contact number, a list of other IP addresses in that range with the same owner, and dates of registration.\nFor example, for the 216.58.194.78 IP address, ARIN WHOIS says the owner is Google.\nIf You Don’t Know the IP Address Some services are similar to ARIN WHOIS, but they can search for the website owner even when the website’s IP address is unknown. Examples include Register.com, GoDaddy, and DomainTools.\nTo use ARIN WHOIS to find the owner of an IP address, convert the website to its IP address using a ping command in the Windows command prompt. Open the command prompt and type the following to find the website’s IP address:\nping websitename.com\nReplace websitename with the website you want to find the IP address for.\nAbout Private and Other Reserved IP Addresses Some IP address ranges are reserved for use on private networks or for internet research. Attempting to look up these IP addresses in Whois returns an owner such as Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). However, these same addresses are employed on many home and business networks worldwide. To find who owns a private IP address in an organization, contact their network system administrator.\nWhat is my IP address?
