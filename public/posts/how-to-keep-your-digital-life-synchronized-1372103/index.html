We have our laptops for work, our tablets for entertainment, and our smartphones for communication. We use numerous apps to manage our emails, calendars, contacts, and notes. With so many devices and apps, it can become overwhelming to keep everything in sync. But fear not, there is an ultimate hack that can simplify your life and keep everything in perfect sync.\nThe key to keeping everything in sync is to have a single platform that can manage all your devices and apps. Enter cloud technology. Cloud technology is a remote server that allows you to store and access your data from anywhere and on any device. It is the ultimate life hack for keeping your entire digital life in sync.\nThere are numerous cloud-based services available, but the most popular ones are Google Drive, iCloud, and Dropbox. These services allow you to store and access all your documents, photos, and videos online. They also provide syncing services which keep your documents and files updated across all your devices. These services not only save you time but also provide security to your data by keeping it safe from hardware failures, disasters, and crashes.\nIn addition to cloud-based services, there are apps that can manage your emails, contacts, and calendars. The most popular ones are Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail. These apps provide syncing services that keep your emails, contacts, and calendars updated across all your devices. They also have features like tags, filters, and labels that can help you organize your emails and contacts efficiently.\nMoreover, there are note-taking apps like Evernote and OneNote that can keep all your notes in sync. These apps allow you to create, edit, and access your notes on any device. They also have features like tags, notebooks, and reminders that can help you stay organized.\nBeyond cloud-based services and apps, there are also browser extensions that can help you stay synced with your bookmarks, passwords, and browser history. Extensions like LastPass, Pocket, and Xmarks allow you to access your bookmarks and passwords from any device. They also provide syncing services that keep your browser history updated.\nIn conclusion, keeping everything in sync is no longer a challenge with cloud technology. By using cloud-based services, apps, and browser extensions, you can manage your personal and professional life across all your devices. So why not give it a try and discover the ultimate hack to keeping your entire digital life in perfect sync?\nThis is a guest post from Anders Vinther (Easy-Email.net)\nThese days, most people use a variety of electronic devices every day – computers, smartphones, iPads – you name it. I think the only person left who only uses one computer is my mum.\nWe all know how difficult it is to keep your information up to date and readily available when we need it. If you’re anything like me, you don’t want to have to remember to update your USB key before you leave the office or email yourself from your work email address to your personal email address… most often you don’t even know what you will need.\nWouldn’t it be great if you could have all your files, bookmarks, emails, passwords, contacts and calendar up to date, no matter where you are or which computer or device you are using? Here is the complete guide to synchronizing your digital life. Set it up once and then forget about it, it’s all automatic! It will take a bit of time to get it organised up front, but it will save you so much time from then on.\nFirst of all we need to answer the question: what are the building blocks that make up your digital life?\nI have narrowed it down to:\nDocuments Email Contacts and Calendar Internet Bookmarks Passwords 1. Synchronize Documents You want to create a document on your office computer, save it before you go home, and then edit it on your home computer at 3am in the morning when you have had that brilliant brain wave.\nYou also want to be able to get that missing document while you are visiting a client – even if you didn’t bring your computer.\nHow you do it There are a number of different file synchronization options available. Dropbox is my preferred choice. It has been discussed at length here, so I will keep it short.\nYou install a small program on your computer. A new folder is created and everything you place in this folder is automatically synchronized with every other device you own. And you can also access your files from an internet browser by logging on to the Dropbox site.\nIt is dead easy to use! You can even share folders with other people, so there’s no need to keep emailing each other different versions of a document.\nWhere to get it \u0026 price: Go to www.dropbox.com and sign up.\nYou get the first 2GB for free. 50 GB is $9.99/month, 100 GB is $19.99/month.\n2. Synchronize Email Email is here to stay (just ask the Google Wave people). It is still the essential means of communication. And that will not change in the near future.\nIMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is the key here. IMAP is a techonology which enables you to synchronize your email with a server instead of downloading it to your computer. And this means you can access all your email from other computers and smartphone too. By storing a local copy on your laptop you can also work with your email offline.\nThere are many ways of doing this. I recommend you make use of Gmail’s excellent service. You can create a free Gmail account and use this as a central synchronization hub. The benefit of using Gmail is that they support a wide range of mobile devices, so you can get your email on your smartphone too. Another benefit is Gmail’s ability to collect and send email from your other email accounts too, whether webmail or another email client.\nAll modern email clients support IMAP (some better than others).\nIn short, the steps for setting up synchronization via IMAP are:\nCreate a Gmail account and enable IMAP (in the settings). Configure Gmail to collect and send email from your other email addresses. Setup your email clients (Outlook, Apple Mail, Thunderbird, Windows Live Mail etc) to connect to your Gmail account using IMAP. Setup your email clients to send email from your other email addresses too. Setup your mobile devices to talk to your\tGmail account. IMAP is a technology and is supported by most (if not all) email clients. So you can use your favorite email client or even a combination of email clients.\nYou can get a free Gmail account at www.gmail.com.\nIf you would like detailed instructions on how to set this up, you’ll find easy to follow, illustrated guides at Easy-Email.net (free for 1 email address, $37 for multiple email addresses).\n3. Synchronize Contacts \u0026 Calendar We meet more people than ever before. And we have more ways of communicating with those people than ever before. So we need to keep on top of our contact information.\nAnd as we become busier and busier we need our calendar available at all times too.\nThere are many ways to synchronize your contacts and calendars. Most of these are sufficient for point to point synchronization, so if you only ever use one computer and one phone it is easy to keep both synchronized. However once the number of computers increase, it becomes more difficult to keep everything in sync.\nAs with email, the best way to avoid headaches is to use Gmail as a central synchronization hub. Gmail can synchronize with most devices.\nWhere to get it \u0026 price Mobile devices:\nA good starting point for contact sync between Gmail and your phone is here: www.google.com/mobile/sync Goosync: www.goosync.com (Free Service, Lite Service £8.99/year, Premium Service £19.95/12 months) For Outlook 2003, 2007 and 2010:\nCompanion Link: www.companionlink.com ($39.95) Plaxo: www.plaxo.com (45€) Soocial: www.soocial.com (Free limited service or $3.99/month or $39/year) gSyncit: www.daveswebsite.com/software/gsync ($19.99 per computer) Thunderbird:\ngContactSync: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/8451/ (free) Zindus: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/6095/ (free) Google Contacts: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/7307/ (free) Google Calendar Tab: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/70768/ (free) Lightning: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/2313/ (free) Provider for Google Calendar: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/4631/ (free) Apple Mail:\nBuilt in functionality in latest releases of Apple Mail (free) If you would like detailed instructions on how to setup synchronization of contacts and calendar between your email client and Gmail, you can get easy to follow, illustrated guides from Easy-Email.net ($10 or $1 in combination with an Advanced Guide). Available for Outlook 2003, 2007, 2010, Apple Mail and Thunderbird.\n4. Synchronize Internet Bookmarks How many times have you been searching for that site you know you bookmarked only a couple of days ago? Only to find that you bookmarked it on your other computer!\nGreat news! Xmarks is still alive and kicking! (It was touch \u0026 go for a while)\nHow you do it: You simply install xmarks in all your internet browsers, setup an account and forget about it. Easy!\nXmarks can even remember which tabs you had open! (Premium version)\nGo to www.xmarks.com.\nFree for Internet Browsers, $12 per year for mobile devices/premium version.\n5. Manage and Synchronize Passwords Worried about identity theft? Can’t remember your passwords? Re-using passwords and user names across different web sites?\nYou create an account with Lastpass. Whenever you sign up for a new site, Lastpass will offer to generate a strong password for you and store it securely so only you can access it. Next time you visit the site, Lastpass will fill in the login information for you. This is much more secure than storing login details in your browser. Not only have you increased your security considerably, but you have also made your life easier!\nYou simply install Lastpass on all your computers and your user names and passwords will automatically be synchronized everywhere. You can even access them via the internet.\nNow you only need to remember one password.\nWhere to get it \u0026 price: Create an account at www.lastpass.com.\nFree for Internet Browsers, $1 per month for mobile devices.\nExtra Tip for Small Businesses We run a small two man band business. We write the Easy-Email guides and run the web site. In the company we use Dropbox, Easy-Email and Lastpass to share everything company related. This means we can work on the same documents, respond to each others email when one is away and have easy access to all our company logins for our 40+ web sites. No problem!\nConclusion I hope this helps save you hassle and increase your efficiency. As mentioned, we use all of these tools daily in our business and I’d hate to think how much time we would waste if we had to go back to how we used to work before.\nSo go ahead and get your missing pieces of the puzzle set up – then you can kick back and enjoy the freedom to compute from anywhere.\nDamien Oh started writing tech articles since 2007 and has over 10 years of experience in the tech industry.
