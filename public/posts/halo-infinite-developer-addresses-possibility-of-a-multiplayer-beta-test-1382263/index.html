Halo Infinite Beta Test Confirmed by Developers Fans of the Halo series, get ready to don your Spartan armor and get back into the fight! 343 Industries, the developers of Halo Infinite, have just announced that a beta test of the highly anticipated game will be available for players to try out soon. This is exciting news for fans of the series who have been eagerly anticipating the next installment in the classic first-person shooter franchise.\nHalo Infinite is the sixth main entry in the Halo series and is set to take place after the events of Halo 5: Guardians. The game features an open-world environment and a new story that will see players teaming up with series protagonist, Master Chief, to take on a new enemy known as the Banished.\nThe beta test will be available to all registered Halo Insider members and will allow players to try out a selection of the game’s multiplayer modes. This will give players an opportunity to experience the game’s updated graphics, new weapons, and updated gameplay mechanics before the full game releases later this year.\nSo, how can you get in on the action? First, you will need to sign up for the Halo Insider Program on the official Halo website. This will allow you to receive updates on the game’s development, as well as participate in beta tests like the one confirmed by the developers. Once you have signed up, you will need to complete several surveys and provide feedback on previous Halo games to be eligible for the beta test.\nOnce the beta test is live, participating Halo Insider members will be able to download and play the game for free. While the exact start date of the beta test has yet to be announced, it’s expected to come shortly before the official release of the game later this year.\nIn conclusion, the announcement of the Halo Infinite beta test has set the gaming world abuzz with excitement. Fans of the series can’t wait to try out the new game and get a taste of the updated gameplay mechanics, weapons, and graphics. If you’re a fan of the series, sign up for the Halo Insider Program now to ensure that you don’t miss out on this exciting opportunity to help beta test one of the most highly anticipated games of the year. With a new enemy to take on and an open world to explore, Halo Infinite promises to be an epic addition to the beloved franchise. So, get ready to master the battle and become a true Spartan warrior!\nThere is no doubt that Halo Infinite is one of the most anticipated titles coming out this year, and although the campaign gameplay of the title was shown on the occasion of the Xbox Games Showcase, in the last few days some interesting details have emerged on the last effort of 343 Industries.\nHowever, a developer of the American software house has recently addressed many of the concerns regarding Halo Infinite, including the possibility of releasing a beta version of the multiplayer mode.\nDuring an interview with Halo Waypoint, John Junyszek, Community Manager of 343 Industries, said that due to the health emergency caused by COVID-19, the entire production process was slowed down. So, although the team is still working hard on the project, he does not rule out the possibility of offering its players a practical gaming experience, before the release of the project.\nIn that sense, the developer discusses the following whether there will be a multiplayer beta test:\nIn recent news, a retailer has listed in its database that the Halo Infinite’s multiplayer will be free-to-play and it will run at 120 FPS.\nAt this time we’re honestly not sure what is going to be possible in terms of flighting but we still hope to have an opportunity for broader public hands-on before release. And, as we’ve previously stated, we’ll be relying on flighting and continued feedback and community partnership well beyond launch as we grow and evolve the game together.\nRecall that Halo Infinite will release during the Christmas holidays of 2020, even if no official release date has been announced at the moment, on Xbox Series X, PC, and Xbox One.\n","wordCount":"712","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-29T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-29T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tammie Curnow"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/halo-infinite-developer-addresses-possibility-of-a-multiplayer-beta-test-1382263/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Get Ready to Master the Battle!
