This game is a online multiplayer game themed around social deduction, where players join together to reveal the imposters on the spaceship. What makes this game unique is that it’s centered around teamwork and communication skills. Players need to detect imposters and work together to accomplish their tasks, leading to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when the team succeeds. And this is what keeps players coming back for more.\nGoose Goose Duck Mallard Manor Map Guide Now let’s get to the meat of the matter - the map guide. The map is divided into various sections, each with its pathways and rooms. For a beginner, it can be confusing to navigate across the map. However, follow these tips, and you’re sure to get better and familiar with the map in no time!\nThe Lounge The Lounge is where the game begins, and all players collect for their first meeting. It has four doors leading out to different sections. This room also features a vent, which imposters can use for teleportation. To prevent the imposters from escaping unnoticed, always keep an eye out for anyone suspicious leaving or entering the vent.\nThe Meeting Room The Meeting room is where players gather to vote on the suspected imposters.

You may need to investigate what they’re up to.\nThe Kitchen The Kitchen is where players go to complete the cooking task. It has three entrances leading to different sections of the Manor. This room has a ventilation system that is a possible escape route for imposters. Watch out for anything that seems out of place in this room.\nThe Viewing Deck The Viewing deck is a wide-open space with a great view. It is also the easiest area to surveil in the game. Just keep an eye out for anyone who appears to be standing idle or leaves as soon as they notice you.\nThe Engine Room The engine room of the spaceship features various tasks, but remember to be careful - this room also contains vents used by imposters to travel quickly. Keep track of who goes in and out of the room.\nFinal Thoughts Goose Goose Duck Mallard Manor is undoubtedly an enjoyable game to play, even for beginners.
