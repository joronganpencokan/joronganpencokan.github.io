Here’s The Crucial Step You NEED To Follow To Secure Your Device!\nJailbreaking your iPhone has become increasingly popular over the years as it allows users to access new features and functionality that they otherwise would not have had access to. However, with great power comes great responsibility. Jailbreaking your iPhone also opens up new vulnerabilities to cyber attacks and hacking attempts, so if you’re going to go down that road, there is a crucial step that you need to follow to secure your device.\nBefore we dive in, let’s quickly go over what jailbreaking is. Jailbreaking is the process of removing the restrictions imposed by Apple on their iOS operating system. This allows you to install third-party apps, customize the look and feel of your phone, and access features that would not otherwise be available. However, by doing so, you also remove the security measures put in place by Apple to protect your device from malicious attacks.\nNow, onto the crucial step you need to take to secure your jailbroken device - installing a reputable antivirus app. An antivirus app will scan your device for any malicious software, viruses, or other malware that may have made its way onto your device. Since jailbreaking removes Apple’s security features, your device is more vulnerable to these types of attacks, and thus, it’s essential to have an antivirus app installed to protect your device.\nHere are some antivirus apps that you can consider installing on your jailbroken iPhone:\nAvast Security \u0026 Privacy - This app offers a range of features, from malware protection to a VPN, password management, and more.\nNorton Security - Norton is a well-known brand in the antivirus and security industry, and their app for iOS offers malware protection, safe browsing, and device recovery features.\nMcAfee Mobile Security - McAfee offers comprehensive protection against malware, phishing, and other cyber threats. Their app also includes a VPN and device optimization features.\nBitdefender Mobile Security - Bitdefender offers real-time protection against malware and other cyber threats. Their app also includes anti-phishing features and a VPN.\nBy installing one of these antivirus apps on your jailbroken iPhone, you’re taking a crucial step to ensure that your device is secure and protected from cyber attacks. It’s also essential to keep your device and apps updated, only download apps from trusted sources, and avoid risky behavior, such as clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown files.\nIn conclusion, jailbreaking your iPhone gives you access to new features and functionality, but it also removes the security measures put in place by Apple to protect your device. To ensure that your jailbroken iPhone is secure, it’s crucial to install a reputable antivirus app, such as Avast Security \u0026 Privacy, Norton Security, McAfee Mobile Security, or Bitdefender Mobile Security. By doing so, you can enjoy the benefits of a jailbroken iPhone while keeping your device protected from cyber threats.\nLet me start this article by telling you about a person who was successful in attacking the vulnerabilities of phones on T-mobile Netherlands last year. There was not really a grave malicious intent on the side of the hacker except that he just wanted the people–whose iPhones were hacked–to know how vulnerable their gadgets were and he wanted them to pay 5 Euros to gain security for their iPhones. The hacker took advantage of the known root password (i.e. alpine) to get into jailbroken iPhones.\nThere are so many advantages which come when you jailbreak your iPhone. Some of them include the use of Twidget which enables you to view your tweets on lock screen and the use of Winterboard to let you manage the themes in your iPhone. Additionally, jailbreaking your iPhone will give you total control over your iPhone file system. However, once your iPhone is jailbroken, it will become vulnerable and less secure; you will need to take extra measure to retain its security.\nOne reason why the hacker was able to get into the iPhones of the victims is because they haven’t changed the default password after they had them jailbroken. Considering the fact that “alpine” is the default password of the root directory, and that the whole world knows about this, you should take some time to change it into your own password which no one knows about–except you.\nPerhaps, the reason why people leave their password unchanged after jailbreaking their iPhone is because they do not know how. If you are one of them, then this would be the guide you are looking for…\nChange the Root Password of your iPhone Before anything else, I assume you had your iPhone jailbroken…\nOpen Cydia and install MobileTerminal app; you will need this to launch the Terminal app.\nLaunch the Terminal app. Key in this command:\nNow, key in the default password:\nBy doing this, you will be able to log in as the “root” user. It means that you will be able to access everything inside your iPhone while using this user. Also, always remember that the passwords will not be shown/echoed on screen.\nOnce you have done all of the above, you are ready to proceed to this next step. Key in this command:\nThis command will let you change the password for the “root” user. After you key it in, you will then be prompted to type and confirm your new password.\nAnd that’s it! I am sure you will find this tutorial easy enough to follow. But anyway, let me remind you that you also need to have a strong password; what’s the use of having a password if anyone can easily crack it, right?\nChoose a Strong Password This one may not be new to you. However, there are still people who do not know how to create a password which is harder to crack. The fact is, majority of the people use their birthdays, surnames or a combination of their first and last names plus their birthdays. Believe me, those passwords can be easily cracked even by a grade-schooler. Here is a quick guide for you to come up with a really good password;\nAlways use a combination of Numbers, Letters and Characters. Capitalize some of the Letters randomly. Have as many characters as possible in your password. A minimum of six characters would be good enough. Never ever use your First Name, Last Name, Birthday or the names of your family and friends. More often, people know more about you than you think they do. If possible, use a string of characters which you can easily type without even looking at the keyboard. Do not use any actual word because crackers have dictionaries which contain millions of possible passwords that they can easily run to crack your password. Never ever use the word “password.” Always find an easy way to remember your passwords. Writing them down is always the worst option you can have. Above all, never ever give your password to anyone. More often, we treat our iPhones as diaries which hold some of our personal information which we do not want to be exposed to anyone we don’t know. Therefore, making them more secure is the best thing we can do to protect our privacy. I hope this article is helpful enough.
