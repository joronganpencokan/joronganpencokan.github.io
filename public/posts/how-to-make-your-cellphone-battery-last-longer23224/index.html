In today’s world, we rely on our cellphones for almost everything, from communication to entertainment, work, and finance. However, one frustrating problem that most people face with their cellphones is poor battery life. Running out of battery power can be a source of stress, particularly when you need your phone the most.\nLuckily, there are several ways to extend your phone battery life without spending a fortune on extra battery packs or replacing your cellphone. Below are some secrets to help you improve the battery life of your phone and avoid those frustrating moments of dead batteries.\nAdjust Screen Brightness and Timeout Settings One of the biggest drains on your phone’s battery is the screen, particularly when it’s set to high brightness levels and stays on for extended periods. The longer the screen stays on, the more power it drains from your battery.\nTo save your phone’s battery life, adjust your screen brightness settings to a lower level, and ensure the screen time-out settings are set to a short duration. This will help you conserve your phone’s power while also improving the longevity of your battery life.\nDisable and Uninstall Unused Apps Apps consume a significant amount of power, particularly those that run in the background or have push notifications. Some of these apps can drain your phone’s battery even when you’re not using them. Therefore, it’s essential to disable and uninstall apps that you’re not using.\nTo disable apps on your phone, navigate to ‘settings,’ and select ‘apps.’ From there, select the app you want to disable and click the ‘disable’ button. To uninstall apps, select ‘manage apps’ or choose the app you want to remove and click ‘uninstall.’\nTurn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth When Not in Use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are useful features on your phone that can drain your battery life when not in use. Therefore, it’s important to turn them off when you’re not using them.\nTo disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, navigate to the ‘settings’ menu and select ’network connections.’ From there, switch off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. This will help preserve your battery life and extend its longevity.\nUse Power-Saving Mode Most smartphones come with power-saving modes, which are designed to reduce power consumption and preserve battery life. When enabled, power-saving mode will optimize your phone’s settings and reduce its performance, allowing you to use your phone for longer periods.\nTo enable power-saving mode, navigate to the ‘settings’ menu and select ‘battery.’ From there, click on ‘power-saving mode’ and activate it. This will help you extend your phone’s battery life and avoid the frustration of dead batteries.\nCharge Your Phone Properly Finally, charging your phone properly can help extend its battery life. Avoid charging your phone with high-powered adapters, as they can cause overheating and reduce the lifespan of your battery.\nInstead, use the charger that came with your phone, and don’t overcharge your phone. Disconnect it from the charger once it’s fully charged to avoid damage to your battery.\nIn conclusion, extending your cellphone’s battery life is possible with some simple changes to your phone’s settings and usage habits. By adjusting your phone’s brightness and timeout settings, disabling and uninstalling unused apps, turning off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when not in use, using power-saving mode, and charging your phone properly, you can improve the longevity of your phone’s battery life and never worry about dead batteries again!\nThis article explains seven of the most effective things you can do to avoid walking around with an adapter looking for a place to recharge.\nWhat to Know\nTurn off unused features \u003e turn off Wi-Fi in wireless networks \u003e reduce screen brightness.Or turn off push notifications \u003e disable data-fetching \u003e turn on Do Not Disturb.Turn on Airplane mode \u003e use paid apps instead of ad-supported apps \u003e don’t let phone get too warm. Turn Off Features Not in Use Turn off Bluetooth. Disable GPS when not in use. Shut down Wi-Fi. You might even consider disabling your hotspot features. These are some of the biggest battery drains on smartphones because they are always looking for possible connections, networks, or information. Turn off these features in your phone’s settings except when you need them to save power.\nSome phones, such as Android smartphones, have widgets that offer toggles to turn these features on or off so you can switch on Bluetooth when you’re in the car for hands-free driving or GPS navigation and then turn it off to save your phone’s battery life.\nTurn On Wi-Fi When You Can Connect to a Wi-Fi Network Having Wi-Fi turned on drains your battery if you’re not using it, but if you’re on a wireless network, it’s more power-efficient to use Wi-Fi than to use cellular data, so switch to Wi-Fi instead of your mobile network when you can to save your phone’s battery life. For most people, that means when you’re at your house, use Wi-Fi, but when you aren’t near any Wi-Fi networks, turn Wi-Fi off to keep your phone running longer.\nAdjust the Display Screen Brightness and Screen Timeout As with laptops and TVs, the screen on your phone drains a lot of its battery life. Your smartphone probably auto-adjusts its brightness level, but if your battery starts dipping to levels that make you anxious, adjust the screen brightness lower to conserve battery life.\nAnother setting to look at is the screen timeout. That’s the setting for when your phone’s screen automatically goes to sleep—1 minute, for example, or 15 seconds after not getting any input from you; the shorter the time frame, the better the battery life. Adjust to your level of patience.\nTurn Off Push Notifications and Data-Fetching One convenience of modern technology is having everything delivered instantly, as it happens. Emails, news, the weather, celebrity tweets—you are constantly getting updates. Besides being bad for your sanity, the constant data-checking depletes your phone battery. Adjust the data-fetching intervals and push notifications in your phone’s settings and apps.\nNews apps and social media apps regularly check in the background for new information. Set those to check manually or hourly. If you don’t need to know the second every email comes in, changing your email push notifications to manual can make a difference in your phone’s battery life.\nAt the very least, you can turn on Do Not Disturb to prevent the screen from waking up each time your phone gets an alert.\nDon’t Waste Battery Life Searching for a Signal Your poor phone is low on battery, and it’s trying to find a signal. When you’re in an area with a weak cellular signal, turn cellular data off by going into Airplane mode. Airplane mode turns the cellular and data radio off on most phones, but it leaves Wi-Fi access on for some devices.\nBuy Apps Instead of Using Free, Ad-Supported Versions Shelling out a couple of bucks for apps you use may be worth it. Research suggests free, ad-supported apps drain battery life. In one case, 75 percent of an app’s energy consumption was used just to power the ads. Even in the case of Angry Birds, only 20 percent of the app’s energy use may go to actual gameplay.\nThe other option is to use an ad blocker to see if it reduces the drain on your battery.\nKeep Your Phone Cool Heat is the enemy of all batteries, whether it’s your phone’s battery or your laptop’s. You might be able to eke out a bit more life from your phone if you take it out of a hot case or your pocket, don’t leave it overheating in a hot car, and can manage to find other ways to keep it cool.\nAs a last resort, turning your phone off when it is not in use can cool it down and conserve the battery.\nHow long should the average phone battery last? Cellphone batteries typically last between 3-5 years. To maximize your battery’s lifespan, avoid extreme temperatures and avoid completely draining the battery to 0% or fulling charging it to 100%. How do I check my Android battery’s health? To check your battery health on Android, use a third-party app such as AccuBattery. Tap Settings \u003e Battery \u003e Battery Usage to learn which apps are using the most power. How do I make my phone charge faster? To make your phone charge faster, turn on Airplane Mode or power down your phone. If your device supports it, use USB-C chargers that speed up charging time. Don’t use your phone when it’s charging.
