With a user base of over 1 billion people, it’s no wonder that many of us find ourselves constantly checking our feeds, notifications and messages. But what if you need to log out of your Instagram account from a public computer or device? Don’t worry, it’s much simpler than you might think.\nStep 1: Open Instagram on your device.\nFirst things first, make sure you have the Instagram app downloaded on your device or open the website in a browser. Once the app or website is open, you’ll need to locate your profile picture located in the bottom right corner of your screen.\nStep 2: Locate and access your account settings.\nOnce your profile picture has been located, tap on it, which will take you to your account settings. This page will show you all of your profile information, posts, and any other settings.\nStep 3: Scroll down to the “Log Out” button.\nIf you’re using the app on your mobile device, scroll down until you see the “Log Out” button located at the bottom of your account settings. If you’re using the website, you’ll want to click on the three lines in the top right-hand corner of the screen to access your settings, followed by clicking on the “Log Out” button at the bottom of the page.\nStep 4: Confirm the log-out process.\nOnce you’ve located the “Log Out” button, tap or click on it to confirm. You’ll be prompted to confirm the action and will be automatically logged out of your current session. You can go ahead and close the app or website at this point, knowing your account has been securely logged out.\nSimple, right? Logging out of your Instagram account is an easy way to protect your personal information if you happen to log in on a public device or computer. Follow these simple steps the next time you need to log out, and you’ll be sure to safeguard your account while also satisfying your social media addiction.\nSocial media is something everybody likes and we spend a considerable amount of our time on it, and why not! It helps us to stay connected with the world. But with the rise in the popularity of social media platforms, they are being more prone to hacking as well. And therefore these platforms keep adding new security features like a remote log out, two-factor authentication, etc. to them. But unlike Facebook and Gmail, Instagram doesn’t provide any feature to remotely log out of your Instagram account on other devices. However, we have a workaround using which you can easily log out of Instagram remotely on other devices.\nThere are many situations when you would like to remotely log out your Instagram account from another device. For instance, when you have logged into your Instagram account on your friend’s device and forgot to log out. Or if you have a doubt that your account is being misused or hacked by someone. No matter what the situation is, the method given below will help you in signing out of Instagram from everywhere. It can be achieved from the Instagram app on Android and iPhone as well as from its website.\nCheck If Your Account Is Hacked Before actually signing out from Instagram on other devices you can confirm if your account is being used by someone or not. For that, you can check for some suspicious activity on your account which you have not done.\nFor example, likes or comments on someone’s posts, or photos being posted on your account without your permission. To check whose post you’ve liked you can go to Settings \u003e Account \u003e Posts You’ve Liked.\nOther than that, you can check the account activity to know about the time you spent on Instagram for the past 7 days. For that, you can go to Settings \u003e Account \u003e Your Activity.\nWith this feature, you can get an idea if someone is using your Instagram account or not by looking at the usage pattern of your account. However, if you could not find any evidence of anyone using your account, you can still logout of Instagram on another device, because why take the risk?\nRemotely Log Out Of Instagram On All Devices Using App On Android And iPhone The procedure is the same for the iPhone as well as for Android devices.\nOpen the Instagram app on your device.\nNext, open your profile by tapping on the profile icon at the bottom right corner. Now tap on the hamburger icon at the top right and select Settings.\nNow scroll down and look for the Security option and tap on it. Next, tap on Password. Now you need to change the password of your Instagram to log out of all the devices.\nEnter the old password and then type in the new one. Finally, tap on the done. (tickmark icon)\nThat’s it. You will be logged out of all the devices including apps as well as from desktop apart from the current device you are using.\nFrom Desktop On Instagram Website If you are a desktop user then you can use the below steps to sign out of your Instagram account from someone’s device.\nLog in to your Instagram account from the browser and visit your profile page.\nNext, click on the gear icon next to the Edit profile option. and choose Change Password.\nNow, enter your old and new password and click on Change Password to change it.\nAs soon as you do it, you will be logged out of all the devices.\nSecure Your Instagram Account You can not just simply rely on the remote sign out all the time for the security of your account. That being the case, you can secure your Instagram account once in for all by enabling two-factor authentication. This feature ensures that only you get to log into your account as it sends a unique OTP each time you try to log in on your registered phone number.\nConclusion As there is no official feature to remotely log out from other devices on Instagram, still the method mentioned above is a perfect workaround. Moreover, you can secure your Instagram account by enabling two-factor authentication on it. Also, it is recommended to use a strong secure password for your account and keep changing it at regular intervals. It reduces the chances of your account getting hacked.
