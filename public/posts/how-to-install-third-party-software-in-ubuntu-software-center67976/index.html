It provides users with a wide range of software applications that are available for free download. However, installing software on Ubuntu can be complicated for new users. In this article, we’ll show you how to unlock the secret to installing top-rated software on Ubuntu in seconds.\nStep 1: Use the Terminal to Install Software The easiest way to install software on Ubuntu is to use the terminal. You can open the terminal by pressing “Ctrl + Alt + T” or by searching for it in the Ubuntu dash. Once the terminal is open, you can use the following command to install software:\nsudo apt-get install [software name]\nReplace [software name] with the name of the software you want to install. For example, if you want to install GIMP, the popular image editor, you can type:\nsudo apt-get install gimp\nPress enter and enter your password if prompted. The terminal will then download and install the software for you.\nStep 2: Use Ubuntu Software Center Another way to install software on Ubuntu is to use the Ubuntu Software Center. You can access it by clicking on the Ubuntu Software icon in the dash. Once it’s open, you can search for the software you want to install and click on the “Install” button. Ubuntu Software Center will download and install the software for you.\nStep 3: Use External Repositories Sometimes, the software you want to install is not available in the Ubuntu Software Center or the default repositories. In this case, you can use external software repositories to install the software. To add an external repository, you need to open the terminal and use the following command:\nsudo add-apt-repository [repository URL]\nReplace [repository URL] with the URL of the repository you want to add. Once the repository is added, you can use the apt-get command to install the software from the repository.\nConclusion: Installing top-rated software on Ubuntu is easy if you know the right steps. You can use the terminal, Ubuntu Software Center, or external repositories to install the software of your choice in seconds. By following these simple steps, you can unlock the secret to installing top-rated software on Ubuntu and take your computing experience to the next level.\nAfter written thousands of Linux articles, one of the complaints that I always heard about Linux is that you have to use the command line to install applications. Most people don’t like Windows, but they were afraid to move to Linux because of the command line. In Windows, they can install an application by double clicking the exe file, but in Linux, they have to use the command line. So is it true that the command line is the only way to install applications in Linux?\nThe answer is NO. Most Linux distro comes with its own package manager where you can search for the applications you want and install them in a few clicks. In Ubuntu, the equivalent of a package manager is the Ubuntu Software Center, though it is more of a marketplace than a package manager. However, as good as these package managers seem, there is one problem: they only contain applications that are in their repository. If you want to install a third party application not in the default repository, you won’t be able to find and install the application from the package managers.\nIn Ubuntu, here are a few ways to install third party software from the Ubuntu Software Center.\nDeb file The good (and bad) thing about Linux is that there are many ways to install an application. You can compile from source, install from repository, or install using the deb/rpm package. Ubuntu supports the deb format and Ubuntu Software Center is the default handler for deb file. That means, after you have downloaded the deb file, all you have to do is to double click it and it will open up in Ubuntu Software Center. You can then view the application detail and install the application.\nThis is by far, the easiest way to install third party application in Ubuntu. However, not all applications are available in the deb format. This brings us to the next method: installing via PPA.\nLaunchpad PPA A good number of applications are hosted in Launchpad. This means that you can easily add the PPA and install the application in your computer. The classical way of installing application via PPA in the terminal is to use the commands:\nThis is basically a three steps process:\nAdd the PPA to your repository. Update the system Install the application In Ubuntu, we can replicate the above three steps using GUI.\n1. Add PPA to your repository Open the “Software \u0026 Updates” application in Ubuntu. Click the “Other Software” tab, follow by the “Add” button.\nCopy the PPA (should be in the format: “ppa:developer/xyz“) and paste it into the field. Click “Add Source”.\nOnce the PPA is added, you can close the “Software \u0026 Updates” application.\nNote: Other than Launchpad PPA, you can also add other repository here. It should be of the format like “deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu raring main“.\n2. Update the system Open the “Software Updater” application. It should automatically update the system. If not, click “Check now”.\n3. Install the application Now, you can open Ubuntu Software Center and search for the application that you want to install.\nYou can also click the arrow beside the “All Software” tab to narrow down to the particular PPA so as to make your search easier.\nConclusion Until Ubuntu Software Center comes with the ability to add PPA and refresh the repository within itself, we still have to depend on three different applications to install third party PPA application in Ubuntu Software Center. Personally, I prefer to use either the .deb file or the command line in the terminal as they allow me to be more productive. What about you? Do you prefer to use Ubuntu Software Center, or the command line?\nDamien Oh started writing tech articles since 2007 and has over 10 years of experience in the tech industry.
