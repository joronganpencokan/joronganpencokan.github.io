Have you ever found yourself struggling to complete tasks on your Android device due to the seemingly endless distractions that come with it? Whether it’s checking social media, replying to messages, or answering calls, it can feel like you’re not accomplishing anything at all. Multitasking is a concept we have all heard about, but how often do we actually take advantage of it?\nFortunately, mastering the art of multitasking on your Android device can be a game-changer when it comes to productivity and efficiency. In this article, we’ll be sharing some tips and tricks to help you transform your life and get the most out of your Android device.\nUnderstand the Power of Split-Screen Mode One of the most notable features of Android devices is the ability to use split-screen mode. This feature allows you to display two apps on your screen simultaneously. To enable this feature, simply open two apps that you want to use and tap on the square button at the bottom of your screen.\nBy using split-screen mode, you can finish tasks much faster, such as taking notes while browsing the internet, taking a call while responding to a message, or even watching a tutorial video while using an app. This, in turn, can help you be more efficient and reduce the time it takes to finish your tasks.\nUtilize Keyboard Apps that Support Multitasking Multitasking isn’t just about using multiple apps at once; it’s also about getting things done faster. If you’re someone who types a lot on your Android device, you’ll love keyboard apps that support multitasking.\nFor instance, Gboard by Google has the ability to multitask, allowing you to search the web or find GIFs right from the keyboard itself. Similarly, SwiftKey Keyboard provides quick access to your clipboard, enabling you to easily paste recently copied text without having to switch between apps.\nExperiment with Widgets Widgets are an excellent way to streamline your productivity and make multitasking a breeze. By adding widgets to your home screen, you can quickly access important tasks without having to open an app. For example, you could add a widget for your calendar that allows you to see your upcoming appointments or a widget for your to-do list that shows your current tasks.\nAndroid devices offer a wide range of widgets that can be customized to your liking, making multitasking much more efficient and accessible.\nLearn to Prioritize Ultimately, the key to successful multitasking lies in prioritizing. Identify the tasks that are most important and need to be completed first. By focusing on the most critical tasks, you can work towards crossing them off your list faster and with more efficiency.\nTake advantage of tools such as notifications, reminders, and alarms to help you stay on top of your tasks. By doing so, you can transform your Android device into a powerful multitasking tool that allows you to accomplish more in less time.\nConclusion In conclusion, multitasking can be a powerful tool when used effectively on an Android device. By using split-screen mode, keyboard apps that support multitasking, widgets, and learning to prioritize, you can transform your productivity and efficiency in no time. Try incorporating these tips and tricks into your daily routine and see how much more you can accomplish with your Android device today!\nAndroid is one of the most versatile operating systems around, but something it’s always seemingly lacked – synonymous as it is with mobile devices – is proper multitasking functionality. It just doesn’t seem all that convenient on a small screen, but the reality is that there are now apps and low-key Android features that make it more palatable as a multitasking device than ever.\nSo here we’re going to show you the things you can do and download to multitask properly on your Android device.\nUse that Recent Apps Button Maybe this one’s aimed more for the elder Android users, with the young ones finding the benefits of that third navigation bar button besides “Back” and “Home” bleedingly obvious. But the amount of times I’ve seen less experienced Android users hitting the Home button, then manually navigating to the previous app they were just using has inspired me to take a stand.\nQuite simply, if you’re flicking between a few apps on rotation during a session (say Google Docs or a note-taking app while researching something on Chrome), then teach yourself to navigate between them using the Recent button in the navigation bar. It’ll save you a ton of time in the long run over going back to the home screen each time.\nA neat secret feature of the Recent button is that double-tapping it toggles between the two most recent apps you opened.\nSplit Screen The next step is to try out the split-screen feature that has been in Android since the days of 7.0 Nougat. To enable split-screen, open the first app you want to use in split-screen, then press the Recent button in the navigation bar, tap the app’s icon above its window thumbnail, and tap “Split screen.”\nThat app will now be shifted to take up about a quarter of the screen at the top, and you can then either select another app from the Recent list, or press the Back button and manually pick another app for the original one to share the screen with. Once you pick another app, it will automatically take up half the screen, sharing it with the original app.\nNote that split-screen works with auto-rotate, so you can also view two apps by holding your phone horizontally\nSplit Screen Launcher Building on Android’s built-in split-screen feature, Split Screen Launcher makes it that bit more robust. The best thing Split Screen Launcher does is let you pick pairings of apps that you most frequently use together, then create a home screen shortcut to instantly open those two apps in split-screen.\nIt’s already a very well-made app but still a work-in-progress, as it’s still in early access. That means there may be even more handy multitasking features inbound!\nFluid Navigation Gestures If you’re up for downloading a third-party app, then you can’t go too wrong with this one. Fluid Navigation Gestures makes it even quicker to navigate between apps using an overlay at the edges of your screen.\nWhile many of the actions involve functions you can already do on your phone in other ways, there are a few extra gestures here that are particularly noteworthy. The “Previous App” and “Next App” actions do something you can’t otherwise do on Android by seamlessly switching between apps without the Recent Apps screen.\nThe Toggle Split-Screen gesture is also handy, again skipping past the Recent Apps screen to enable the split-screen function right away.\nIf you’re looking for more ways to optimize navigation gestures, read our list of the best navigation gesture apps for Android. Or if you’re a mobile gamer, these are the best iOS and Android games coming out in 2020.\nContent Manager at Make Tech Easier.
