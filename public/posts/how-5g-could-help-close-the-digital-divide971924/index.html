However, with a significant percentage of underprivileged communities worldwide lacking exposure to high-speed internet services, bridging this digital divide appears to be challenging. Revolutionary 5G technology may hold the key to closing this gap, and in this article, we will explore how it can help disadvantaged communities.\n5G technology is the latest iteration of mobile data technology aimed at providing faster, more reliable, and higher-quality wireless communication. With its low latency, high bandwidth, and high-speed connectivity, 5G is capable of delivering consistent internet coverage, as well as improved operational and security services.\nHow 5G Technology can Benefit Disadvantaged Communities\nEnhances Access to Healthcare Services – One of the most significant challenges facing underprivileged communities is access to healthcare services. Telemedicine, a critical service facilitated by 5G technology, can potentially help provide medical aid to remote and socio-economically deprived areas where the nearest hospital is miles away. With this technology, patients can consult with doctors, receive remote diagnoses and even have virtual consultations.\nFacilitates Education – Education is another fundamental need for progress and development. The 5G network could revolutionize learning opportunities in underserved communities by providing remote access to quality education. This could open doors to global education resources and give underprivileged children a chance to access quality education in subjects like technology or medicine, which may not have been available before.\nEnables Inclusive Economic Growth – 5G has the potential to spur job creation and improve economic participation opportunities for people living in underserved and marginalized communities. With faster internet speeds, it is easier and more efficient to access online job portals, create online businesses, and facilitate e-commerce. This can lead to employment opportunities and foster inclusive economic growth.\nGiven the current COVID-19 pandemic, the potential of the 5G technology is also being realised with remote working and e-commerce becoming ever more important.\nLasting Benefit – 5G technology is an investment in long-term infrastructure. With its far-reaching benefits, it is sure to have a lasting impact on the lives of people living in disadvantaged communities. 5G is expected to remain relevant for the next decade, making it a sustainable investment for the underserved communities.\nClosing words\nThe world must come together to ensure that everyone gains access to the latest technologies, and 5G is one of the most promising of all. Its ability to provide high-speed connectivity and improved operational efficiency has the potential to transform the lives of underprivileged communities worldwide. Inclusive growth and access to quality healthcare and education are key to achieving global progress, and 5G technology is poised to play a significant role in making that possible.\nNew technology from Qualcomm will help pave the way for more accessible broadband internet, experts say.\nKey Takeaways\nQualcomm announced a new 5G Fixed Wireless Access platform that could help bring stable internet to more users.New devices will make use of the technology to provide increased coverage range for 5G connections.Advancements like this can be used to help push broader access to stable internet connections with gigabit-capable speeds. Getting reliable internet access in rural or marginalized communities has always been difficult, thanks to the increasing costs of laying new cable or fiber wire. Qualcomm’s new second-generation 5G Fixed Wireless Access platform aims to deliver fiber-capable speeds without the need to lay miles of wire. Experts believe this could help narrow the digital divide even more by giving additional users access to reliable and faster internet.\n“A lot of the attention around 5G has to do with cell phones,” Peter Holslin, a writer at HighSpeedInternet.com and an expert in 5G connectivity. told Lifewire via email.\n“This is a big step forward when it comes to 5G technology because it gives cellular companies the platform necessary to make 5G home internet a commercially viable product on a wide scale.”\nThe Gap The broadband divide—sometimes referred to as the digital divide—is a term used to refer to the gap between those who have reliable broadband internet access and those who don’t. Over the years this gap has closed, though there are still large numbers of customers who either don’t have access at all or who only have access to slower speeds.\nAccording to The State of Broadband 2019 report, an estimated 57.8% of global households had access to the Internet at home as of 2018. This divide has only been made more apparent over the course of 2020, though, as kids within rural areas found themselves traveling miles to pick up and drop off work, or even completing their homework while connected to Wi-Fi hotspots set up in parking lots.\nWhile the FCC believes the gap is closing, others believe it isn’t closing fast enough, with Microsoft estimating in 2018 that nearly 163 million Americans were not using the Internet at broadband speeds. This isn’t an easy matter to solve, though, especially when factoring in the costs of expanding or upgrading internet service areas, which often requires internet service providers (ISPs) to dig trenches and lay miles of cable or fiber wire capable of carrying the internet connection to your home. Atlantech.net estimated that the cost of fiber wire itself ranged anywhere from $1 to $6 per foot back in January 2020. At that cost, laying fiber for just two additional miles outside of a current service area would cost the provider a minimum of $10,560 for the materials alone, before installation. It’s an expensive process, which often leads to certain areas being less likely to get upgraded or even accessible internet through traditional ISPs.\nBuilding a Bridge “The problem is getting this high-speed fiber connectivity; digging the trench, bringing it to the last mile, and sometimes—depending on if you’re in a city, a suburb, or a rural place—that last mile is 50 meters or maybe even a kilometer,” Gautam Sheoran, senior director of product management at Qualcomm, explained on a call with Lifewire.\nBut, what if there was a way to move beyond the expensive costs of laying new fiber cables, and instead deliver stable, broadband access through wireless connections? That’s the basic idea behind Qualcomm’s new Fixed Wireless Access platform.\nWhile the FCC believes that the gap is closing, others believe that it isn’t closing fast enough.\nWorking in tandem with some of the company’s other recently announced advances, like the Snapdragon X65 Modem-RF, Qualcomm’s Fixed Wireless Access platform can get users access to gigabit speeds over much longer distances, without costing ISPs as much to expand. “Qualcomm’s 5G Fixed Wireless Access is basically a prototype for a modem/router that you can install in your house to get Wi-Fi over a fixed-wireless connection from 5G transmitters outside,” Holslin told us.\n“It can pick up signals on a wide array of 5G bands, so it’s more versatile than if it was limited to millimeter-wave 5G bands (which are super fast but can only reach devices within eyeshot of a 5G tower).”\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1178","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-25T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-25T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Paul Brady"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-5g-could-help-close-the-digital-divide971924/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionary 5G Technology Set to Bridge Gap for Disadvantaged Communities- Find out How!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-25 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 25, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1178 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Paul Brady</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#heading></a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#the-gap>The Gap</a></li><li><a href=#building-a-bridge>Building a Bridge</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Revolutionary 5G Technology Set to Bridge Gap for Disadvantaged Communities- Find out How!</p><p>In a world driven by technology, it is essential for everyone to gain access to it.
