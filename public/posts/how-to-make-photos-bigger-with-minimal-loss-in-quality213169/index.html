Want to increase the size of your photos without sacrificing their quality? You’re not alone. In today’s world, photos play a crucial role in different fields, from personal to commercial use. Therefore, it is essential to know how to increase photo size without compromising their quality. In this article, we will look at the secret art of increasing photo size without sacrificing quality.\nUse Image Upscaler Tools One of the easiest ways to increase the size of your photo is by using image upscaler tools. These tools use advanced algorithms to enhance and enlarge your images without blurring or degrading their quality. Some of the best image upscaler tools include:\nLuminar AI: This tool uses artificial intelligence to create stunning images without sacrificing their quality. It resizes your images while preserving their details and textures.\nTopaz Gigapixel AI: This tool uses machine learning to enlarge your photos without losing their quality. It can upscale your image up to 6 times its original size.\nAdobe Photoshop CC: This popular tool has several features that allow you to resize your images without losing their quality. It has an advanced algorithm that adds pixels to your image without compromising its sharpness.\nUse Interpolation to Resize Your Images Interpolation is a mathematical technique that allows you to increase the size of your photos without losing their quality. It works by adding new pixels to your image based on the existing pixels. Interpolation methods include:\nBilinear: This method uses the average color of the four nearest pixels to compute a new pixel value. It is the fastest method but not as accurate as other methods.\nBicubic: This method uses the neighboring 16 pixels to compute a new pixel value. It is slower than bilinear but produces sharper images.\nLanczos: This method uses a complex combination of pixels to compute a new pixel value. It produces the sharpest images but is slower than the other methods.\nShoot in Raw Shooting in RAW mode allows you to capture the maximum amount of data from your camera’s sensor. RAW images contain more information, which allows you to resize your image without losing its quality. RAW images have a much larger file size than JPEG images, which can be a disadvantage.\nConclusion Increasing the size of your photo without losing its quality is essential in today’s digital world. The above-discussed techniques utilize the latest technologies to enhance your images’ sizes while preserving their quality. Using these techniques, you can see a significant difference in the quality of your photos. Whether you are a professional photographer or someone who enjoys taking pictures for personal use, mastering the art of increasing photo size without compromising quality is a valuable skill to have.\nOne of the most commonly asked questions concerning graphics software is how to increase the size of an image without getting blurred and jagged edges. New users are often surprised when they resize an image and find that the quality is severely degraded. Experienced users are all too familiar with the problem.\nThe reason for the degradation is because bitmapped or raster image types are limited by their pixel resolution. When you attempt to resize these types of images, your software either has to increase the size of each pixel (resulting in a jagged image) or it has to “guess” at the best way to add pixels to the image to make it larger.\nNot long ago, there weren’t many options for increasing resolution other than using your editing software’s built-in resampling methods. Today, we are faced with more possibilities than ever. Of course, it’s always best to capture the resolution you need right from the beginning. If you have the option to rescan an image at a higher resolution, by all means, you should do that before resorting to software solutions. And if you have the money to put into a camera capable of higher resolutions, you might find that money is better spent than if you were to put it into a software solution.\nHaving said that, there are times when you may have no other choice than to resort to software.\nResizing vs. Resampling Most software only has one command for both resizing and resampling. Resizing an image involves changing the print dimensions without changing the total pixel dimensions. As the resolution is increased, the print size becomes smaller, and vice versa. When you increase resolution without changing pixel dimensions, there is no loss in quality, but you must sacrifice print size.\nResizing an image using resampling, however, involves changing the pixel dimensions and will always introduce a loss in quality. That’s because resampling uses a process called interpolation for increasing the size of an image. The interpolation process estimates the values of the pixels the software needs to create based on the existing pixels in the image. Resampling via interpolation results in serious blurring of the resized image, especially in areas where there are sharp lines and distinct changes in color.\nAnother aspect of this issue is the rise of the smartphone, the tablet, and the corresponding focus on the device pixel. These devices contain two to three pixels in the same space occupied by one pixel on your computer screen. Moving an image from your computer to a device requires you to create multiple versions of the same image (e.g. 1X, 2X and 3X) to ensure they display correctly on the device. Does one increase the size of the image or increase the number of pixels?\nCommon Interpolation Methods Photo editing software generally offers a few different interpolation methods for calculating new pixels when an image us upsampled. Here are descriptions of the three methods available in Photoshop. If you don’t use Photoshop, your software probably offers similar options although they may use slightly different terminology.\nBicubic is the slowest but produces the best estimation of new pixel values.Bilinear is faster than bicubic but does a poorer job. Both bicubic and bilinear interpolation result in a blurred image, especially when upsampling.Nearest Neighbor doesn’t use interpolation. It simply takes the value of the neighboring pixels and adds new pixels without averaging them. This is when you get the jaggies or stair-step effect. Note that there are more than just these three methods of interpolation and even using the same method in different software may produce different results. Photoshop offers the best bicubic interpolation of any other software that we have compared.\nOther Interpolation Methods A few other image enhancement programs offer other resampling algorithms that claim to do a better job even than Photoshop’s bicubic method. Some of these are Lanczos, B-spline, and Mitchell. A few programs that offer these alternate resampling methods are Qimage Pro, IrfanView (a free image browser), and Photo Cleaner.\nIf your software offers one of these resampling algorithms or another one not mentioned here, you should certainly experiment with them to see which one gives you the best results. You may even find that different interpolation methods produce better results depending on the image used.\nStair Interpolation Some folks have discovered that you can get better results when upsampling by increasing the image size in several small increments rather than one extreme step. This technique is referred to as stair interpolation. One advantage to using stair interpolation is that it will work on 16-bit mode images and it requires no additional software other than a standard photo editor, such as Photoshop.\nThe concept of stair interpolation is simple: Rather than using the image size command to go directly from 100% to 400%, you would use the image size command and only increase, say, 110%. Then you would repeat the command as many times as it takes to get to the size you need. This can be tedious if your software does not have some automation capability.\nIf you use Photoshop 5.0 or higher, you can purchase Fred Miranda’s stair interpolation action for $15 US. You’ll also find more information and image comparisons. Since this article was originally written, new resampling algorithms and software technologies have been developed which make stair interpolation essentially obsolete.\nGenuine Fractals LizardTech’s Genuine Fractals software (formerly from Altamira Group) attempts to break through image resolution limitations with its award-winning resolution-on-demand technology. Genuine Fractals is available for Windows and Macintosh. It operates as a plug-in to Photoshop and other Photoshop plug-in compatible image editors. With it, you can encode low to medium resolution files to a scalable, resolution-free format called STiNG (*.stn). These STN files can then be opened at any resolution you choose.\nUntil recently, this technology was your best bet for increasing resolution. Today, cameras and scanners have gotten better and come down in price, and the investment in Genuine Fractals is not as easily justified as it once was. If you have the option of putting your money into better hardware rather than software solutions, it’s usually the better way to go. Still, for extreme upsampling, Genuine Fractals is pretty amazing. It also offers other benefits such as smaller encoded files for archival and storage.\nAlien Skin Blow Up Although Genuine Fractals was the early leader in upscaling technology, Alien Skin’s Blow Up plugin for Photoshop is worth a look if extreme enlargements are something you require. Blow Up supports most image modes, including high bit-depth images. It can resize layered images without flattening, and options to resize in place, or as a new image.\nBlow Up uses a specialized sharpening method and simulated film grain to improve the appearance of extreme enlargements.\nThe Bottom Line When evaluating these methods for increasing resolution on your own, try to avoid getting caught up with how the images look on-screen. Your printer capabilities are going to play a big factor in the final results. Some comparisons may appear distinctly different on screen, but barely discernible when printed. Always make your final judgment based on the printed results.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1677","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-02T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Karen Goodman"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-make-photos-bigger-with-minimal-loss-in-quality213169/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Master the Secret Art of Increasing Photo Size Without Compromising Quality</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 2, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1677 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Karen Goodman</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#use-image-upscaler-tools>Use Image Upscaler Tools</a></li><li><a href=#use-interpolation-to-resize-your-images>Use Interpolation to Resize Your Images</a></li><li><a href=#shoot-in-raw>Shoot in Raw</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li><li><a href=#resizing-vs-resampling>Resizing vs. Resampling</a></li><li><a href=#common-interpolation-methods>Common Interpolation Methods</a></li><li><a href=#other-interpolation-methods>Other Interpolation Methods</a></li><li><a href=#stair-interpolation>Stair Interpolation</a></li><li><a href=#genuine-fractals>Genuine Fractals</a></li><li><a href=#alien-skin-blow-up>Alien Skin Blow Up</a></li><li><a href=#the-bottom-line>The Bottom Line</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>+++
