If you want move on from uploading game videos to actually live streaming your own gameplay on YouTube, all you need is a decent computer and internet connection, a verified YouTube account, and a free video encoder program that’s compatible with YouTube.\nGetting set up to stream games on YouTube is a little complicated, but you only have to go through the entire process one time. After that, you’ll be able to start streaming at any time with the push of the button.\nWe’ll show you two methods to stream games on YouTube, including both XSplit and OBS, and also how to stream at any time without any additional software.\nWhat You Need to Get Started With YouTube Game Streaming YouTube makes it extremely easy to live stream your webcam, but streaming a game is a little more complicated. To stream on YouTube Gaming, you need:\nA verified YouTube account: If your YouTube account isn’t verified, you won’t be able to stream. Don’t worry, the verification process is easy. A computer: You can use a Windows, Mac or Linux computer to stream, and you can use a desktop or a laptop. The important thing is that the computer must be powerful enough to encode video in real time while you’re also playing a game. Broadband internet: Your internet connection needs to have enough upstream bandwidth to upload high definition video in real time. An encoder program: This program records your gameplay, encodes it into a format that’s suitable for streaming, and uploads it to YouTube. Without an encoder, you can’t stream on YouTube Gaming. Two free options are Open Broadcast Studio (OBS) and XSplit Broadcaster. If you want to talk to your viewers, or insert live video of yourself on top of your games, you’ll also need a headset or microphone and a webcam.\nHere’s where you can download the OBS and XSplit Broadcaster encoders:\nDownload OBS for Windows, MacOS and Linux Download XSplit Broadcaster for Windows How to Verify Your YouTube Account Before you can live stream on YouTube, you need to verify your account. If you don’t have an account at all, you’ll need to first navigate to the main YouTube site and click Sign In. Since you don’t have an account, you’ll need to click on Create an account and follow the instructions.\nIf you have a YouTube account, and it isn’t verified, you’ll need to verify it before you can stream.

Choose to receive a voice message or text message. Enter your phone number, and click Submit. Wait for the voice or text message, and enter the code.

There used to be an easy way to access this control panel from YouTube Gaming, but that method was removed when YouTube Gaming was folded back into YouTube.

In the Basic Info section, enter a title and description for your stream. In the Encoder Setup section, click Reveal. Write down the Stream name/key, which appears when you click Reveal.

You do have to sign up for an XSplit account when you install the program, but you don’t need to pay for a subscription. If you prefer open source software that’s totally free, skip this section and use OBS instead.\nNavigate to YouTube.com/live_dashboard.\nThere used to be an easy way to access this control panel from YouTube Gaming, but that method was removed when YouTube Gaming was folded back into YouTube.

Without an encoder, you can&rsquo;t stream on YouTube Gaming. Two free options are Open Broadcast Studio (OBS) and XSplit Broadcaster.</li></ul><p>If you want to talk to your viewers, or insert live video of yourself on top of your games, you&rsquo;ll also need a headset or microphone and a webcam.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s where you can download the OBS and XSplit Broadcaster encoders:</p><ul><li>Download OBS for Windows, MacOS and Linux</li><li>Download XSplit Broadcaster for Windows</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-verify-your-youtube-account>How to Verify Your YouTube Account<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-verify-your-youtube-account>#</a></h2><p>Before you can live stream on YouTube, you need to verify your account.
