Facebook has become one of the most popular social networking sites with approximately 2.8 billion monthly active users. However, what if you find out that someone has blocked you on Facebook? This can be a big shock for anyone, but thankfully, there are ways to tell if someone has blocked you on Facebook in 2023!\nCheck For Their Profile The first step to figuring out if someone has blocked you on Facebook is to search for their profile. If you try to search for their profile and nothing comes up, it’s likely they have blocked you. However, this could also mean that they have deactivated their account or have changed their privacy settings. So, before jumping to conclusions, try to find their profile using different methods, such as looking through friends’ profiles or searching for their name in Facebook groups.\nCheck The Messenger If you’re still unsure whether someone has blocked you on Facebook, try checking the messenger. If you were previously in a conversation with them, you should be able to see the conversation history. However, if they have blocked you, you will not be able to see any of your previous conversations with them. This is a clear sign that they have blocked you on Facebook.\nCheck Your Mutual Friends Another way to tell if someone has blocked you on Facebook is to check your mutual friends. If you have mutual friends with the person, try looking through their profiles to see if you can find any information. If you can no longer see their posts or comments on mutual friends’ posts, this could be another sign that they have blocked you.\nAsk A Friend If you’re still unsure whether someone has blocked you on Facebook, try asking a friend who is also friends with them. Ask your friend to look at the person’s profile and see if they can see any posts or comments by you. If they can’t, then it’s highly likely that you have been blocked.\nIn conclusion, you can tell if someone has blocked you on Facebook by following these steps. However, it’s important to remember that just because you can’t find their profile, it doesn’t necessarily mean they have blocked you. They could have just deactivated their account, changed their privacy settings, or simply decided to unfriend you. So, before jumping to conclusions, make sure to check all possible avenues.\nTo tell whether someone blocked you on Facebook or deactivated their account, try to search for them on your Friends’ list. If they have deactivated their account, their profile is still there. If they deleted their account, you won’t find their profile. It’s one of the many ways to check it.\nWas there some misunderstanding and now you see that the number of friends has gone down on your Facebook account?\nWell, it happens a lot of times when our real-life interactions/behavior reflect on social media platforms. And please note that it may not always be the case of getting blocked but sometimes the user may delete or deactivate their Facebook account to get rid of the complications and irritation of social networks.\nIn this article, we mention a few ways which can be used to tell if someone blocked you on Facebook or deactivated the account. So without further ado, let’s jump right into the tutorial.\nAlso Read: How To Post A Story On Facebook Page\nHow To Tell If Someone Blocked You On Facebook Or Deactivated Their Account? Check Recent Conversation Open the conversation that you might have had earlier with that person on Facebook chat. If their profile picture is visible to you but you cannot go to their profile by clicking on their profile pic then it is a sign that you are blocked by them.\nMoreover, you won’t be able to send messages to that person as well.\nTo confirm, you can open this conversation in the messenger. If you can see their pic but the message box is disabled then it means that you have been blocked.\nHowever, if the person has not blocked you but left Facebook by deactivating their account then obviously you cannot message or visit their profile similar to blocking.\nBut in the case of deactivation, you will not see their profile pic in the conversation as well. You may also see Facebook user (read here about what Facebook user means).\nHowever, keep in mind that only seeing a blank profile image does not mean the person got their profile deactivated; read our post about the blank Facebook profile to learn about all possible reasons for that.\nThis is the main difference between someone blocking you or deactivating their account.\nDo Facebook Search Try searching the person in question using the FB search bar at the top.\nEither you won’t find the person in search suggestions or even if you find them you won’t be able to visit their profile. If you get the following message “Sorry, this content isn’t available right now“, you have been blocked or the person might have deactivated their account.\nAlso, the person may have simply set their privacy settings so that their profile became unsearchable.\nCheck Friend List Of A Mutual Friend Visit the profile of a mutual friend. Open the friend list from their profile. If you are not able to find the suspected person in their friend list, it means that you have been blocked, most likely. Note: Even if the friend has a hidden Friend list still you can access your mutual friends on Facebook.\nAsk A Friend You may also ask a friend to check if they can see the suspected person’s profile.\nIf they are able to view the profile then surely you are on that person’s Block list on Facebook. It may be possible that the person has also blocked your friend as well. To be sure you can ask some other person to check the profile of that person.\nIf another person is also not able to access the profile of that user then most probably the account is not active anymore.\nBonus Tip: Determine Whether You Are Blocked On Facebook Or Account Is Deactivated After checking the above steps follow this tip to tell if someone blocked you or the user has deleted/deactivated the Facebook account.\nOpen Facebook and go to Settings. Under Settings select Blocking. Enter the name of the person under Block users whom you suspect has blocked you and press Enter or click Block.\nIf you find that person’s name on searching then you are blocked. On the other hand, if you cannot find that user in the list after searching then it is highly likely that the user has deactivated their Facebook account and not blocked you.\nVideo With Steps Also, you can check our video:\nHow To Know If Someone Has Blocked You On Messenger (Video) It might also happen that someone just wants to ignore you on the Messenger and does not want to unfriend or block you from Facebook. You can follow the steps below to check if someone is ignoring you on the messenger or not.\nOpen the Messenger app on your phone. Now search for your friend who you think has blocked you on messenger.\nOnce you find the friend, tap on that friend’s name to see your chatting history. Now try to send them a message by typing a message in the text box at the bottom of the screen and then tap on Send.\nIf the message goes through and you see a check inside a circle icon. Then it means the person has not blocked you from Facebook and messenger. When they read your message the check icon will be changed with their profile icon as shown here.\nHowever, if the person has blocked you only on the messenger, then your message will go through but the other person won’t receive it. This means that either they have blocked you on the messenger or they don’t have an active internet connection.\nTo confirm that your friend has not received the message you can look at the check under the circle icon. If the circle is filled with color then it means that the message is received. But, if the check under the circle icon is empty then it means that your friend has not received the message yet.\nIf you can see that the person is active now on the messenger but still the message is not received, then they have definitely blocked you on the messenger.\nOn opening the chat conversation with your friend if you see the message “You can’t reply to this conversation“. Then it means that either you have been completely blocked from Facebook by your friend or they have deactivated the account. You can confirm this by following the steps shown in the previous method.\nAlso, check out this video:\nAlso Read: How To Change Name On Facebook Without Waiting For 60 Days\nWrapping Up We hope that the methods mentioned helped you to tell if someone blocked you on Facebook or not. It’s important to know because having too many people blocked you on Facebook can send you to Facebook Jail and this can have unpleasant consequences.\nWhat happens when someone blocks you on Facebook? When someone blocks you on Facebook, you won’t be able to see their profile or find them using Facebook search. You also won’t be able to send them messages on Facebook.\nWhen someone blocks you on Facebook can they still see your profile? If someone blocks you on Facebook, they can still see your profile. However, you cannot see their profile. They are completely “invisible” to you but on their side, they can still look at your posts, etc.\nHow can you unblock yourself from someone’s Facebook? To unblock yourself from someone’s Facebook, the only way to do it is to go ask that person to revert the block. You cannot do it in any other way.\nShare it with your friends if you found it helpful. Drop a comment if you have any queries.\n","wordCount":"1710","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Victoria Jimenez"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-know-if-someone-blocked-you-on-facebook-in-2023-491776/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You Won't Believe How To Tell If Someone Blocked You On Facebook In 2023!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 20, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1710 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Victoria Jimenez</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#how-to-tell-if-someone-blocked-you-on-facebook-or-deactivated-their-account>How To Tell If Someone Blocked You On Facebook Or Deactivated Their Account?</a><ul><li><a href=#check-recent-conversation>Check Recent Conversation</a></li><li><a href=#do-facebook-search>Do Facebook Search</a></li><li><a href=#check-friend-list-of-a-mutual-friend>Check Friend List Of A Mutual Friend</a></li><li><a href=#ask-a-friend>Ask A Friend</a></li><li><a href=#bonus-tip-determine-whether-you-are-blocked-on-facebook-or-account-is-deactivated>Bonus Tip: Determine Whether You Are Blocked On Facebook Or Account Is Deactivated</a></li><li><a href=#video-with-steps>Video With Steps</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#how-to-know-if-someone-has-blocked-you-on-messenger-video>How To Know If Someone Has Blocked You On Messenger (Video)</a></li><li><a href=#wrapping-up>Wrapping Up</a><ul><li><a href=#what-happens-when-someone-blocks-you-on-facebook>What happens when someone blocks you on Facebook?</a></li><li><a href=#when-someone-blocks-you-on-facebook-can-they-still-see-your-profile>When someone blocks you on Facebook can they still see your profile?</a></li><li><a href=#how-can-you-unblock-yourself-from-someones-facebook>How can you unblock yourself from someone&rsquo;s Facebook?</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>You Won&rsquo;t Believe How To Tell If Someone Blocked You On Facebook In 2023!</p><p>In the age of social media, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine a world without Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
