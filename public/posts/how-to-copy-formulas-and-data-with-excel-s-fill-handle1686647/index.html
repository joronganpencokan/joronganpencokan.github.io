With this knowledge, you can now boost your productivity, save time, and impress your colleagues with your newfound skills. So go ahead and give it a try – you won’t be disappointed!\nExcel’s fill handle is a multipurpose, small black dot or square in the bottom right corner of the active cell that can save you time and effort when it is used to copy the contents of one or more cells to adjacent cells in a worksheet.\nWork With the Excel Fill Handle The fill handle works in conjunction with the mouse. Fill handle uses include:\nThese instructions apply to Excel for Microsoft 365 and Excel versions 2019, 2016, 2013, and 2010.\nCopying data and formatting Copying formulas Filling cells with a series of numbers, such as odd or even numbers Adding the days of week or month names to a worksheet Adding custom lists of commonly used data, such as department names or report headings, to a worksheet Try this easy example within your own Excel spreadsheet.\nHighlight the cell(s) containing the data to be copied or, in the case of a series, extended. Place the mouse pointer over the fill handle. The pointer changes to a small black plus sign (+). Press and hold down the left mouse button, then drag the fill handle to the destination cell(s). Copy Data Without Formatting When you copy data with the fill handle, by default, any formatting applied to the data is copied as well. You can copy data without copying the formatting. After copying data with the fill handle, Excel displays the Auto Fill Options button below and to the right of the newly filled cells.\nHighlight the cell(s) containing the data to be copied or, in the case of a series, extended.\nPlace the mouse pointer over the fill handle. The pointer changes to a small black plus sign (+).\nPress and hold down the left mouse button, then drag the fill handle to the destination cell(s).\nSelecting the AutoFill Options button opens a list of options that include:\nCopy cellsFill formatting onlyFill without formattingFlash fill Selecting Fill without formatting will copy data with the fill handle but not the source formatting.\nCopy Formulas Formulas copied using the fill handle will automatically update to use data in their new location if you created them using cell references.\nCell references are the column letter and row number of the cell where the data used in the formula is located, such as A1 or D23. As an example:\nInstead of entering the actual numbers into the formula in H1 to create this formula,\n= 11 + 21\nuse cell references instead, and the formula becomes:\n=F1 + G1\nIn both formulas, the answer in cell H1 is 32, but because the second formula uses cell references, you can copy it using the fill handle to cells H2 and H3, and it will give the correct result for the data in those rows.\nAutomatically Fill Cells If Excel recognizes the cell contents as part of a series, it will auto-fill other selected cells with the next items in the series. To do so, you need to enter enough data to show Excel the pattern, such as counting by twos, that you want to use.\nHere is a prime example of Excel’s auto-fill feature:\nType the number 2 in cell D1 and press the Enter key. Type the number 4 in cell D2 and press Enter. Select cells D1 and D2 to highlight them. Click and hold down the mouse pointer on the fill handle in the bottom right corner of the cell D2. Drag the fill handle down to cell D6. Cells D1 to D6 should contain the numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. Add Preset Content to Cells Excel also has preset lists of names, days of the week, and months of the year, that can be added to a worksheet using the fill handle. As an example, here is how you might add the days of the week within your worksheet.\nType the number 2 in cell D1 and press the Enter key.\nType the number 4 in cell D2 and press Enter.\nSelect cells D1 and D2 to highlight them.\nClick and hold down the mouse pointer on the fill handle in the bottom right corner of the cell D2.\nDrag the fill handle down to cell D6.\nCells D1 to D6 should contain the numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.\nType Sunday into cell A1. Press the Enter key on the keyboard. Click on the cell A1 again to make it the active cell. Place the mouse pointer over the fill handle in the bottom right corner of the active cell. The mouse pointer will change to a small black plus sign (+) when you have it over the fill handle. When the mouse pointer changes to the plus sign, click and hold down the mouse button. Drag the fill handle to cell G1 to auto-fill the days of the week from Monday to Saturday. Add a Custom List to the Fill Handle Excel also allows you to add your own lists of names such as department names or worksheet headings for use with the fill handle. You can add a list to the fill handle by typing in the names manually or by copying them from an existing list in a worksheet.\nExcel also contains a pre-set list of the short forms for the days of the week such as Sun, Mon, etc. as well as both full and short month names — January, February, March, and Jan, Feb, Mar that can be added to a worksheet using the steps listed.\nType Sunday into cell A1.\nPress the Enter key on the keyboard.\nClick on the cell A1 again to make it the active cell.\nPlace the mouse pointer over the fill handle in the bottom right corner of the active cell.\nThe mouse pointer will change to a small black plus sign (+) when you have it over the fill handle.\nWhen the mouse pointer changes to the plus sign, click and hold down the mouse button.\nDrag the fill handle to cell G1 to auto-fill the days of the week from Monday to Saturday.\nSelect the File tab of the ribbon. Select Options to bring up the Excel Options dialog box. Select the Advanced tab in the left-hand pane. Scroll to the General section of the options list in the right-hand pane. Select the Edit Custom List button in the right-hand pane to open the Custom List dialog box. Type the new list in the List entries window. Select Add to add the new list to the Custom Lists window in the left-hand pane. Select OK twice to close all dialog boxes and return to the worksheet. Import a Custom AutoFill List From a Spreadsheet If you are looking to import custom autofill lists based on the content on your spreadsheets, follow these steps for a more hands-on approach:\nSelect the File tab of the ribbon.\nSelect Options to bring up the Excel Options dialog box.\nSelect the Advanced tab in the left-hand pane.\nScroll to the General section of the options list in the right-hand pane.\nSelect the Edit Custom List button in the right-hand pane to open the Custom List dialog box.\nType the new list in the List entries window.\nSelect Add to add the new list to the Custom Lists window in the left-hand pane.\nSelect OK twice to close all dialog boxes and return to the worksheet.\nHighlight the range of cells in the worksheet containing the list elements, such as A1 to A7. Follow steps 1 to 5 above to open the Custom List dialog box. The range of cells previously selected should be present in the form of absolute cell references, such as $A$1:$A$7 in the Import list from cells box at the bottom of the dialog box. Select the Import button. The new AutoFill list appears in the Custom Lists window. Select OK twice to close all dialog boxes and return to the worksheet. Highlight the range of cells in the worksheet containing the list elements, such as A1 to A7.\nFollow steps 1 to 5 above to open the Custom List dialog box.\nThe range of cells previously selected should be present in the form of absolute cell references, such as $A$1:$A$7 in the Import list from cells box at the bottom of the dialog box.\nSelect the Import button.\nThe new AutoFill list appears in the Custom Lists window.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1884","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bridget Crowe"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-copy-formulas-and-data-with-excel-s-fill-handle1686647/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You've been using Excel the wrong way!

You can add a list to the fill handle by typing in the names manually or by copying them from an existing list in a worksheet.</p><p>Excel also contains a pre-set list of the short forms for the days of the week such as Sun, Mon, etc. as well as both full and short month names — January, February, March, and Jan, Feb, Mar that can be added to a worksheet using the steps listed.</p><p>Type Sunday into cell A1.</p><p>Press the Enter key on the keyboard.</p><p>Click on the cell A1 again to make it the active cell.</p><p>Place the mouse pointer over the fill handle in the bottom right corner of the active cell.</p><p>The mouse pointer will change to a small black plus sign (+) when you have it over the fill handle.</p><p>When the mouse pointer changes to the plus sign, click and hold down the mouse button.</p><p>Drag the fill handle to cell G1 to auto-fill the days of the week from Monday to Saturday.</p><ul><li>Select the File tab of the ribbon.</li><li>Select Options to bring up the Excel Options dialog box.</li><li>Select the Advanced tab in the left-hand pane.</li><li>Scroll to the General section of the options list in the right-hand pane.</li><li>Select the Edit Custom List button in the right-hand pane to open the Custom List dialog box.</li><li>Type the new list in the List entries window.</li><li>Select Add to add the new list to the Custom Lists window in the left-hand pane.</li><li>Select OK twice to close all dialog boxes and return to the worksheet.</li></ul><h2 id=import-a-custom-autofill-list-from-a-spreadsheet>Import a Custom AutoFill List From a Spreadsheet<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#import-a-custom-autofill-list-from-a-spreadsheet>#</a></h2><p>If you are looking to import custom autofill lists based on the content on your spreadsheets, follow these steps for a more hands-on approach:</p><p>Select the File tab of the ribbon.</p><p>Select Options to bring up the Excel Options dialog box.</p><p>Select the Advanced tab in the left-hand pane.</p><p>Scroll to the General section of the options list in the right-hand pane.</p><p>Select the Edit Custom List button in the right-hand pane to open the Custom List dialog box.</p><p>Type the new list in the List entries window.</p><p>Select Add to add the new list to the Custom Lists window in the left-hand pane.</p><p>Select OK twice to close all dialog boxes and return to the worksheet.</p><ul><li>Highlight the range of cells in the worksheet containing the list elements, such as A1 to A7.</li><li>Follow steps 1 to 5 above to open the Custom List dialog box.</li><li>The range of cells previously selected should be present in the form of absolute cell references, such as $A$1:$A$7 in the Import list from cells box at the bottom of the dialog box.</li><li>Select the Import button.</li><li>The new AutoFill list appears in the Custom Lists window.</li><li>Select OK twice to close all dialog boxes and return to the worksheet.</li></ul><p>Highlight the range of cells in the worksheet containing the list elements, such as A1 to A7.</p><p>Follow steps 1 to 5 above to open the Custom List dialog box.</p><p>The range of cells previously selected should be present in the form of absolute cell references, such as $A$1:$A$7 in the Import list from cells box at the bottom of the dialog box.</p><p>Select the Import button.</p><p>The new AutoFill list appears in the Custom Lists window.</p><p>Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/heart-shaped-island-location-guide-where-to-find-the-heart-shaped-island-in-fortnite-1357182/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>You won't believe where Fortnite's elusive Heart Shaped Island is hiding - Let us reveal the secret location!</span></a>
