This game has been praised for its open-world, mythical world-building, challenging boss fights, and unique play style. However, navigating the world of Elden Ring can be a daunting task. With numerous paths to take and hidden secrets to uncover, it’s easy to lose your way. That’s why we’ve created this ultimate guide to help you unveil the secret starting path in Elden Ring.\nUnderstanding the World of Elden Ring\nBefore we delve into the guide, let’s talk about what Elden Ring is and what makes it unique. Elden Ring is an action-packed RPG game created by From Software, known for titles such as Dark Souls and Bloodborne. The world of Elden Ring is an open world, filled with mythical creatures, formidable foes, and vast lands waiting to be explored. Each area has a unique lore and history, with hidden secrets that the player can uncover by exploring the world. One of the unique features of Elden Ring is its open-world design, allowing you to take any path you desire.\nChoosing Your Starting Path\nWhen you first start the game, you’ll be presented with several options for your starting path. Each of these paths has a distinct starting location and skill set. Below is a breakdown of the starting paths available in Elden Ring.\nThe Knight: The Knight is a beginner-friendly class with a balanced and versatile play style. They start with a shield and sword, making them ideal for players who prefer a defensive play style.\nThe Mage: The Mage’s starting play style is focused on magic, with a variety of spells at their disposal. Mages start with a magic staff and light armor, making them more fragile than other classes.\nThe Thief: The Thief is a class with a stealthy play style that focuses on quick strikes and evasion. Thieves start with a dagger and light armor, making them agile and elusive.\nThe Barbarian: The Barbarian is a class with a heavy-hitting play style that focuses on brute force. Barbarians start with a large two-handed axe and heavy armor, making them slow but incredibly powerful.\nStarting Path Tips and Tricks\nEach starting path has its strengths and weaknesses, so it’s essential to choose the path that suits your play style. Once you have selected your starting path, you’ll be taken to your starting location. Below are some starting path tips and tricks to help guide you through your first few steps in Elden Ring.\nExplore Your Starting Location: Each starting location has hidden secrets, including valuable loot and hidden paths. Take your time to explore, look for hidden paths and triggers, and grab any loot you find.\nLevel Up: Start leveling up early as it will give you an advantage in battles. You can level up by using the souls you collect from defeating enemies.\nChoose Your Battle System: Elden Ring offers two battle systems, a traditional one and a new real-time strategy (RTS) battle system. Choose the one that best suits your play style.\nTake Your Time: Elden Ring is a challenging game, and it’s easy to get frustrated. Take your time, learn enemy patterns, and remember that death is not the end. You’ll respawn at the last checkpoint, allowing you to try again.\nNavigating the Mythical Realms of Elden Ring\nNavigating the world of Elden Ring can be daunting for a first-time player. However, armed with the right tools and knowledge, it can be an exhilarating experience. Always remember to take your time, explore, and experiment with your play style. With this ultimate guide, you should be equipped to unveil the secret starting path in Elden Ring and navigate its mythical realms.\nEdlen Ring gives you the freedom of finding your own path and unraveling the story yourself. But there are areas you are better off avoiding in the beginning especially if you are low level. For example, going East from your starting location in Limgrave is a no-no, if you don’t want to make your game difficult right from the beginning. On the opposite spectrum of things, there is a specific path you can follow to get powerful right in the beginning. So today we will look at what we believe is the best starting path in Elden Ring to get OP early.\nHow to Get OP Early in Elden Ring? To get OP early in Elden Ring you need to follow a specific Game Progress Route to get +4 Weapon, tons of runes, double healing, powerful spirit companion, improved armor, and unlock all important in-game features early. All of these can be done without even killing a single enemy as per the path curated by YouTube channel Boomstick Gaming. We used the path suggested by him, and we can vouch that his video works 100%.\nWe will break down the locations with what you earn from each of the locations and also provide screenshots of the game progress path for your convenience here.
