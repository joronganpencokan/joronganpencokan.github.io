Yes, you read that right! The Console Messages feature is a powerful tool that every Mac user should know about.\nWhat is Console Messages?\nConsole Messages is a feature built into your Mac’s operating system that records all system messages and events. It’s like a log of everything that happens on your computer, which can help you troubleshoot problems quickly.\nHow to Access Console Messages?\nTo access Console Messages, follow these steps:\nOpen your Applications folder, and then go to Utilities. In the Utilities folder, click on Console to open it. Once you have opened the Console, you will see a list of system messages and events that have occurred on your Mac. What can Console Messages Do?\nThere are many advantages to using Console Messages on your Mac. Some of the most significant benefits are:\nTroubleshooting Problems: Console Messages can help you troubleshoot all kinds of problems on your Mac, from software and network issues to hardware problems. The Console messages will give you a detailed account of everything that happened on your Mac, including the error messages, which can help you pinpoint the problem quickly.\nMonitoring System Performance: Another significant benefit of using Console Messages is that it can help you monitor your Mac’s system performance. You can use it to see how much CPU, RAM, and disk space your system is using, and what processes are running.\nIdentify Malicious Activity: Console Messages can even help you identify malicious activity on your Mac. If a virus or malware is trying to hide in the background, the Console messages will let you know by presenting its activity logs.\nDebugging Programs: Lastly, Console Messages can help developers troubleshoot software that they are developing. If you are a developer, then Console Messages will give you an extensive list of error messages to help you resolve any issues that you face during the development of your software.\nIn Conclusion\nIn summary, Console Messages is an incredibly powerful tool that every Mac user should know about. From troubleshooting problems to monitoring system performance and identifying malware, Console Messages can do it all. So next time you encounter an issue with your Mac, open up Console Messages, and solve the problem in seconds!\nIf you’ve just recovered from a system crash, you might be told to check the Console for error messages. But what do those Console messages mean, and how can you interpret the logs to troubleshoot your Mac?\nWhat Is the Console? Console is the application that collects log messages from your computer for user review. It collects errors, warnings and standard “here’s what I did” log messages from system and user applications. It’s a fantastic resource for troubleshooting. It should be your first stop after your computer experiences a random restart, kernel panic or application crash.\nYou can find the Console application with “Applications -\u003e Utilities -\u003e Console.app,” or by typing “Console” into the Spotlight or Launchpad search bars.\nGetting Acquainted with Console When you first open Console, you’ll be confronted by a torrent of real-time log messages. Most of these are unimportant, mundane application reports describing what the application is doing at that moment. It’s not material that’s typically important for the user to know, but if you want to find it, that’s where it lives.\nYou can toggle off Console’s stream of consciousness by clicking the “Now” button in the upper-right or by scrolling up.\nThis will “freeze” Console messages at the current moment, but new messages will continue to come in at the bottom of the queue. You just won’t be auto-scrolled to them.\nTo remove currently visible messages from the Console, click the “Clear” button in the menu bar. This will let you focus on just what’s happening now. The view will be reloaded soon after you click Clear, and new log messages will begin to appear.\nBut we don’t really care about these standard log messages. We’re interested in seeing the problems. To see only log messages about problems, click “Errors and Faults” below the menu bar.\nIf you look at the search bar in the upper-right of the window, you’ll notice that Errors and Faults is really just a saved search. You can create your own searches by manipulating the search bar.\nIf you’ve made a custom search you like and want to save it to the filter bar, click the “Save” button.\nInterpreting Console Messages to Troubleshoot Your Mac The most important types of console messages are errors and faults, which we filtered for above.\nThese reports tell you when something has gone wrong in the world of your computer and may or may not require addressing. Faults, the most serious console message, get red dots, while errors, which are more like warning messages, get yellow dots.\nThe process column will tell you the name of the application or system process that sent the error. Some will be familiar, and others will be foreign to you. The most serious faults are typically spawned by the “kernel” process.\nTo learn more about a specific message, click on it and check out the info pane at the bottom of the window.\nEvaluating Individual Faults and Errors The info window returns a lot of cryptic information for non-expert users. On the top we see the process that spawned the error message, along with the specific sub-process in parentheses. If you click the “Show” link next to the subsystem and category, you can reveal the Activity ID, Thread ID and PID. PID is the identification number of the process. The Thread ID can describe which part of the process caused the problem, but it’s most useful to the creators of the software. Activity ID will almost always be zero.\nBelow all that identifying information we see the actual log message. In this case I can see that IOReturn is complaining that it can’t unlock the IOAccelSurface2 because the surface is not locked. It’s not important if you don’t know what this means right way, but it often gives you a unique phrase to search. Googling this error leads me to believe it’s a bug with TeamViewer but not critically important.\nConclusion: When Should I Check the Console? Console is most useful when your system has just experienced an error. Maybe an application failed to open and you received a System Report window about it. Or maybe you just rebooted following a kernel panic. Inspecting the Console will help you dig up the cause of the problem and take the necessary steps to fix it.\nAlexander Fox is a tech and science writer based in Philadelphia, PA with one cat, three Macs and more USB cables than he could ever use.\nOur latest tutorials delivered straight to your inbox\n","wordCount":"1167","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lucille Perkins"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-make-use-of-console-messages-to-troubleshoot-your-mac-1116506/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't believe what this hidden feature on your Mac can do!
