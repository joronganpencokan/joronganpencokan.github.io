It connects all the elements of a computer, including the processor, memory, and storage, to one another. A motherboard acts as a bridge that allows different components to communicate with each other and work together properly.\nFor someone with little knowledge of computers, motherboards can look like a maze of circuits and wires that are daunting to understand. But in this article, we’ll unveil the mind-blowing secrets of how a motherboard works and get ready to be amazed!\nStructure of a Motherboard\nThe motherboard is a flat square board that is typically made up of layers of fiberglass and copper. In general, it is divided into several zones. Each zone has its own function and connects various components that make a computer system work.\nThe primary zones of a motherboard are:\nThe CPU socket The CPU socket is where the processor is placed. It is the most critical part of a motherboard as it controls the flow of data between different components.\nRAM slots The RAM slots are the spaces where the memory of a computer is placed. These slots vary in number - some motherboards may have two, while others may have four or more RAM slots.\nThe PCIe slots The PCIe slots are where expansion cards are placed. These cards can be used to add additional functionality to a computer or upgrade its performance. Components like graphics cards, sound cards, and network cards are commonly installed in PCIe slots.\nThe SATA ports The SATA ports are where the storage drives of a computer are connected. These can be solid-state drives (SSDs), hard disk drives (HDDs), or hybrid drives.\nThe power connectors Motherboards require power to function, and power connectors provide the needed power to the motherboard, processor, and other components.\nThe I/O ports The I/O ports provide connectivity options to the outside world, allowing users to connect with different devices. Typically, a motherboard would have USB, Ethernet, and audio ports.\nHow Does a Motherboard Work?\nIn simpler terms, the motherboard acts as a central hub, connecting different hardware components and establishing a link between the software and hardware of the computer.\nThe processor, also known as the brain of the computer, manages all the functions of the motherboard. It communicates with the RAM, which allows for fast and efficient data processing. The hard drives, SSDs, and other storage drives are all connected to the SATA ports, allowing for file storage and retrieval.\nThe motherboard’s BIOS (Basic Input Output System) is the first thing that is loaded when a computer is turned on. This is a program that tells the computer how to start and initializes the hardware components, so they work correctly with each other.\nThe motherboard’s firmware, such as UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), provides an interface between the BIOS and the operating system, allowing communication between the hardware and software components.\nClosing Thoughts\nIn conclusion, a motherboard is an essential component of a computer system as it connects all the hardware components and allows the software to interact with them. With its complex network of circuits and zones, it’s easy to see why so many people consider motherboards to be a mystery. However, with a little understanding, the simplicity and elegance of the motherboard’s design can be appreciated, leaving one amazed and inspired!\nYou have probably heard of a motherboard and know what one is, but do you really know how it works?\nThink of a motherboard as the headquarters of a large company. Without the headquarters, who is supposed to delegate tasks to the remaining employees? And that’s exactly what the motherboard is for. It is the central hub of a computer that connects everything together.\nHere’s an in-depth look at what a motherboard is and how it functions.\nWhat Is a Motherboard? A motherboard is a circuit board with various components that work in unison to make a computer function.\nWe’ve established that a motherboard is the headquarters of a large corporation. But surely, the headquarters is not the only vital aspect to making a company successful. Just like there are different branches of a company, a motherboard has different parts within it that work together to transmit data to each other.\nForm Factor The form factor is basically how a motherboard is formed, or how it physically looks regarding its specifications (namely size, shape, and layout).\nTake McDonald’s for instance. While all McDonald’s restaurants operate the same way, some are set up differently. Some have play centers, fancy self-ordering touch screens, and unbroken ice cream machines.\nIt’s the same with form factors. While all motherboards operate the same way, different models have different kinds of ports, dimensions, and mounting holes. Popular form factors include:\nATX: The prom queen of form factors, the ATX is a popular choice and features large dimensions (most being 12 x 9.6 inches) microATX: A smaller version of the standard ATX with fewer parameters Mini-ATX: Smaller than the micro version, these are designed for mobile CPUs Mini-ITX: Smaller than an ATX board (6.7 x 6.7 inches), the mini-ITX form factors are quiet and don’t use a lot of power Nano-ITX: In between a Pico and Mini-ITX, this works well with thin devices Pico-ITX: Really tiny with a 3.9 x 2.8 in. dimension size and holds up to 1 GB Other discontinued form factors include BTX, LPX, and NLX.\nChipset The chipset allows data to flow between various components, namely the CPU, peripherals, ATA drives, graphics, and memory.\nIt can be divided into these two categories:\nNorthbridge: Located on the “north” side of a chipset, it “bridges” together the following components: CPU, RAM, and PCIe Southbridge: Located on the “south” side of a chipset, it “bridges” together the following components: BIOS, USB, SATA, and PCI Think of a chipset like the CEO of a large company, with the Northbridge and Southbridge acting as the CFO and COO.\nIn business these three C’s (or the C-Suite) work together within the headquarters of a company to delegate tasks to their subordinates. In the case of motherboards, the C-Suite is comprised of the big bosses that make sure information is flowing between the subordinates (like the BIOS, CPU, RAM, etc.).\nCPU Socket This is basically a little habitat for the CPU to rest in. A CPU is a small square with a bunch of pins and connectors underneath it that help to interpret and transmit data carried out by the northbridge part of a chipset.\nThink of the CPU like the overachieving office assistant to a CFO/COO. The office assistant resides in its own cubicle (or in this case, the CPU socket) to execute various kinds of tasks.\nIt’s like a CFO/COO telling an office assistant to schedule meetings, make phone calls, and go on coffee runs. The office assistant, or CPU, carries out these kinds of tasks (but in a more mathematical kind of way, as the CPU reads input and output instructions).\nHaving a high-quality CPU (and office assistant for the matter) is important to the overall speed and efficiency of a computer.\nSlots Think of slots like different branches/departments of a company.\nMost companies have departments for things like marketing, human resources, accounting, research, etc.\nSlots are like these kinds of departments for a motherboard, with branches like:\nMemory/DIMM Slots: Used for holding memory/RAM PCI: Connects expansion cards like video, network, and sound cards PCIe: A modern version of PCI but with a different interface that can work with almost any kind of expansion card USB: Used for USB connectors like flash drives, although not very common SATA: Used for optical/hard disk/solid-state drives Data Bus All of the components mentioned above would not work in unison without the necessary data buses that connect everything together.\nThink of data buses as a form of communication.\nSo in a large company, if the CFO/COO wants to tell an office assistant what to do, how would they go about it? Email? Phone? An in-person conversation? It doesn’t matter as long as there is some form of communication going on.\nIt’s the same idea with a motherboard. All of the components transmit data to one another through data buses.\nPutting Them Together: How It All Works When you turn your computer on, power is sent from the power supply on to the motherboard.\nData is transferred via data buses and goes through the northbridge and southbridge part of the chipset.\nThe northbridge part bridges data to the CPU, RAM, and PCIe. The RAM begins to send inputs to the CPU, which “interprets” these actions as an output. Data to the PCIe is then transferred to an expansion card, depending on which type you have.\nThe southbridge part bridges data to the BIOS, USB, SATA, and PCI. Signals to the BIOS allow your computer to boot up, while data to the SATA “awakens” your optical, hard disk, and solid-state drives. Data from the SATA is used to power up your video, network, and sound cards.\nIn short, a motherboard serves as the headquarters of a computer which transmits data via data buses. These data buses go through the northbridge and southbridge parts of a chipset, which then venture off into other components like the CPU, RAM, PCI, PCIe, etc.\nEverything works together like a successful corporation, albeit in a more binary sort of way.\nImage Credit: Dave Crosby, gcg2009, VIA Gallery, Jarek Kulik, Marlon J.
