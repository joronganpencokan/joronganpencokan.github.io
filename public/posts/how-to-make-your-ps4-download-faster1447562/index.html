Are you tired of waiting hours for your favorite games to download on your PS4? Do you wish there was a way to speed up the process and start playing more quickly? If so, you are not alone. Many gamers struggle with slow download speeds, which can be frustrating and time-consuming. Fortunately, there are several easy steps you can take to improve your PS4 download speeds and enjoy seamless gaming today!\nStep 1: Improve Your PS4’s Internet Connection The first step to lightning-fast download speeds is to improve your PS4’s internet connection. The PS4 relies on a stable, fast internet connection to download games quickly. If your internet connection is slow or unreliable, this can significantly affect your download speeds.\nTo improve your PS4’s internet connection, you can try the following:\nConnect your PS4 to your router via an ethernet cable for a stable, wired connection. Move your router closer to your PS4 to improve signal strength. Turn off other devices that may be using your internet connection while you’re downloading games. By taking these steps to improve your internet connection, you can significantly speed up your PS4 download speeds.\nStep 2: Close Applications and Games When your PS4 is running multiple applications and games simultaneously, this can slow down your download speeds. It’s essential to close any applications or games that you’re not using while you’re downloading games. This will free up your PS4’s system resources and allow your PS4 to focus on the download process.\nTo close applications on your PS4, simply press the PlayStation button on your controller to bring up the Quick Menu. From there, you can select the application you want to close and press the Options button on your controller. Then, select Close Application to free up system resources and improve your download speed.\nStep 3: Put Your PS4 in Rest Mode One of the most effective ways to speed up your PS4 download speeds is by putting your PS4 in Rest Mode. When your PS4 is in Rest Mode, it can continue to download games and updates in the background, even when you’re not using it.\nTo put your PS4 in Rest Mode, simply go to Settings \u003e Power Saving Settings \u003e Set Features Available in Rest Mode. From there, ensure that the following settings are enabled:\nStay Connected to the Internet Enable Turning On of PS4 from Network Enable Automatic Downloads and Uploads Once you have enabled these settings, simply put your PS4 in Rest Mode by holding down the PlayStation button on your controller and selecting Rest Mode. Your PS4 will then continue to download games and updates in the background, allowing you to enjoy lightning-fast download speeds.\nWith these simple steps, you can unlock the secret to lightning-fast PS4 download speeds and enjoy seamless gaming today!

It also includes simple tips to increase download speed on all versions of the PlayStation 4, including the PS4 Pro and PS4 Slim model.\nWhat to Know\nDownload in Rest Mode: Settings \u003e Power Save Settings \u003e Set Functions Available in Rest Mode \u003e Stay Connected to the Internet .Switch DNS: Settings \u003e Set Up Internet Connection \u003e Use Wi-Fi \u003e Custom \u003e Automatic \u003e Do Not Specify \u003e Manual \u003e enter IP address.Use a proxy server: Settings \u003e Network \u003e Set Up Internet Connection \u003e Use Wi-FI \u003e Custom \u003e Router \u003e Automatic or Do Not Specify \u003e Server’s IP and port number. Simple Ways to Increase PS4 Downloads Speed How fast your PS4 can download games, movies, and other software depends largely on your internet connection. That said, here are some basic best practices to abide by to speed up your PS4 downloads:\nDownload one thing at a time: Avoid downloading multiple items simultaneously. Don’t play online during downloads: It will slow down both your game and the download. Pause and Resume: If your download seems stuck at a certain percentage, try pausing and resuming the download to see if that fixes it. Install the latest version of the PS4 system software: You should automatically be prompted to download PS4 system updates when they become available, but if you somehow missed an update, you can get it by navigating to Settings \u003e System Software Update. How to Download in Rest Mode One of the best ways to relieve the burden of waiting for a download is to let it run while your PlayStation 4 is in Rest Mode. Rest Mode is a low-power state in which the console is off, but some functions (like charging controllers and peripherals via USB) can still run.\nHere’s how to tell your PlayStation 4 to finish downloads when you aren’t using it.\nFrom your main dashboard with all of your games, scroll up and to the right and select the toolbox icon to open the Settings. Select Power Save Settings. Choose Set Functions Available in Rest Mode. Check the box next to Stay Connected to the Internet so your console can continue downloading while at rest. Optimizing Your Internet Settings for Faster PS4 Downloads Slow PS4 downloads are usually caused by poor internet connections rather than problems with the console itself. Internet issues can stem from malfunctioning hardware or the limitations set by your internet provider. Depending on your internet plan, you may be limited in how much data you can download at once. If you notice your internet is chronically slow, consider upgrading to a better plan or switching providers.\nFrom your main dashboard with all of your games, scroll up and to the right and select the toolbox icon to open the Settings.\nSelect Power Save Settings.\nChoose Set Functions Available in Rest Mode.\nCheck the box next to Stay Connected to the Internet so your console can continue downloading while at rest. Your modem and router also have limitations on how much data they can handle at once. Even if you’re paying for a top tier internet plan, you can only fully utilize it if your hardware is capable of supporting it. You can check with your internet provider to make sure you have the right equipment for your internet package.\nOptimizing your internet and Wi-Fi settings doesn’t just mean paying for faster internet; there are several free tricks you can try to improve the efficiency of your connection:\nRouter location: Determine the best place for your wireless router. It should be in a central location with no nearby obstructions. Download when no one else is using the internet: A crowded Wi-Fi network can slow down your PS4 downloads, so if another user is downloading something at the same time, both downloads will suffer. Circumvent the router: To get around Wi-Fi issues, you can connect your PS4 directly to your modem via an Ethernet cable for faster downloads. Switching DNS Servers for Faster PS4 Downloads Adjusting your console’s DNS settings is an effective way to speed up PS4 downloads. DNS servers translate human-friendly web addresses into IP addresses, which is why they’re called the phone books of the internet. To switch DNS servers:\nOpen Settings. Select Network. Open Set Up Internet Connection. Select Use Wi-Fi if your console is connected to a wireless network, or choose Use a LAN Cable if your console is connected directly to your modem. Select Custom to change your DNS settings. If you’re using a Wi-Fi network, you’ll be asked to choose your network from a list. You should now be on the IP Address Settings screen. Select Automatic. Choose Do Not Specify. Select Manual to directly edit your DNS IP addresses. You’ll be prompted to enter primary and secondary IP addresses for your DNS server of choice. Either of these options should give you a significant boost over the default settings: Google: 8.8.8.8 (Primary); 8.8.4.4 (Secondary)OpenDNS: 208.67.222.222 (Primary); 208.67.220.220 (Secondary) You can experiment with different DNS servers to see which one works best for your location. ﻿ Once finished, select Next at the bottom of the screen to move on to your MTU settings. On the next screen, select Automatic. Do not try to lower your console’s default MTU number. This solution no longer increases the speed of PS4 downloads. From the Proxy Servers page, select Do Not Use. On the next screen, select Test Internet Connection to see if your download speeds have improved. Results can differ between tests, so run a few to get a closer idea of how fast your connection is. Speed Up PS4 Downloads With a Proxy Server If you’re still unsatisfied with the speed of your PS4 downloads, you can set up a proxy server on your laptop or desktop computer to aid the process.\nOpen Settings.\nSelect Network.\nOpen Set Up Internet Connection.\nSelect Use Wi-Fi if your console is connected to a wireless network, or choose Use a LAN Cable if your console is connected directly to your modem.\nSelect Custom to change your DNS settings.\nIf you’re using a Wi-Fi network, you’ll be asked to choose your network from a list.\nYou should now be on the IP Address Settings screen.

Windows users can try CCProxy for free; Mac users can try SquidMan. Launch your proxy server and obtain its IP and port numbers. If you’re using CCProxy, this information can be found in the options menu. Set up a new internet connection on your PS4. Navigate to Settings \u003e Network \u003e Set Up Internet Connection \u003e Use Wi-FI \u003e Custom, then select your router.

If you notice your internet is chronically slow, consider upgrading to a better plan or switching providers.</p><p>From your main dashboard with all of your games, scroll up and to the right and select the toolbox icon to open the Settings.</p><p>Select Power Save Settings.</p><p>Choose Set Functions Available in Rest Mode.</p><p>Check the box next to Stay Connected to the Internet so your console can continue downloading while at rest. </p><p>Your modem and router also have limitations on how much data they can handle at once. Even if you&rsquo;re paying for a top tier internet plan, you can only fully utilize it if your hardware is capable of supporting it. You can check with your internet provider to make sure you have the right equipment for your internet package.</p><p>Optimizing your internet and Wi-Fi settings doesn&rsquo;t just mean paying for faster internet; there are several free tricks you can try to improve the efficiency of your connection:</p><ul><li>Router location: Determine the best place for your wireless router. It should be in a central location with no nearby obstructions.</li><li>Download when no one else is using the internet: A crowded Wi-Fi network can slow down your PS4 downloads, so if another user is downloading something at the same time, both downloads will suffer.</li><li>Circumvent the router: To get around Wi-Fi issues, you can connect your PS4 directly to your modem via an Ethernet cable for faster downloads.</li></ul><h2 id=switching-dns-servers-for-faster-ps4-downloads>Switching DNS Servers for Faster PS4 Downloads<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#switching-dns-servers-for-faster-ps4-downloads>#</a></h2><p>Adjusting your console&rsquo;s DNS settings is an effective way to speed up PS4 downloads. DNS servers translate human-friendly web addresses into IP addresses, which is why they&rsquo;re called the phone books of the internet. To switch DNS servers:</p><ul><li>Open Settings.</li><li>Select Network.</li><li>Open Set Up Internet Connection.</li><li>Select Use Wi-Fi if your console is connected to a wireless network, or choose Use a LAN Cable if your console is connected directly to your modem.</li><li>Select Custom to change your DNS settings.</li><li>If you&rsquo;re using a Wi-Fi network, you&rsquo;ll be asked to choose your network from a list.</li><li>You should now be on the IP Address Settings screen. Select Automatic.</li><li>Choose Do Not Specify.</li><li>Select Manual to directly edit your DNS IP addresses.</li><li>You&rsquo;ll be prompted to enter primary and secondary IP addresses for your DNS server of choice. Either of these options should give you a significant boost over the default settings:</li><li>Google: 8.8.8.8 (Primary); 8.8.4.4 (Secondary)OpenDNS: 208.67.222.222 (Primary); 208.67.220.220 (Secondary)</li><li>You can experiment with different DNS servers to see which one works best for your location.</li><li>﻿</li><li>Once finished, select Next at the bottom of the screen to move on to your MTU settings.</li><li>On the next screen, select Automatic.</li><li>Do not try to lower your console&rsquo;s default MTU number. This solution no longer increases the speed of PS4 downloads.</li><li>From the Proxy Servers page, select Do Not Use.</li><li>On the next screen, select Test Internet Connection to see if your download speeds have improved.</li><li>Results can differ between tests, so run a few to get a closer idea of how fast your connection is.</li></ul><h2 id=speed-up-ps4-downloads-with-a-proxy-server>Speed Up PS4 Downloads With a Proxy Server<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#speed-up-ps4-downloads-with-a-proxy-server>#</a></h2><p>If you&rsquo;re still unsatisfied with the speed of your PS4 downloads, you can set up a proxy server on your laptop or desktop computer to aid the process.</p><p>Open Settings.</p><p>Select Network.</p><p>Open Set Up Internet Connection.</p><p>Select Use Wi-Fi if your console is connected to a wireless network, or choose Use a LAN Cable if your console is connected directly to your modem.</p><p>Select Custom to change your DNS settings.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re using a Wi-Fi network, you&rsquo;ll be asked to choose your network from a list.</p><p>You should now be on the IP Address Settings screen.
