Find Out the Right Way to Hold It Now! iPads have become essential devices for most people today. They are used daily for work, school, communication, entertainment, and even as e-readers. However, have you ever considered that you may be holding your iPad incorrectly? Holding your iPad incorrectly can lead to poor posture, muscle strain, and even discomfort. So, what is the right way to hold your iPad?\nAvoid Holding Your iPad with One Hand One of the most common mistakes people make when holding their iPad is holding it with one hand. This technique may seem convenient, but it can lead to muscle strain, particularly in the hand and wrist. Holding the iPad with one hand can also cause you to hunch over, leading to poor posture, particularly if you hold it for an extended period.\nUse Both Hands to Hold Your iPad The correct way to hold your iPad is by using both hands. Start by holding the iPad in landscape mode with both hands on each side of the device. Hold the iPad securely but avoid squeezing it too hard as it can cause discomfort. To support the device, use your fingertips, not your palms.\nKeep Your iPad Close to Your Body When using your iPad, ensure that it is close to your body. Avoid holding it away from your body, as this will cause you to strain your arms and shoulders. Holding your iPad close to your body will provide support and prevent muscle strain, giving you a comfortable viewing experience.\nUse a Stand or Case Using a stand or case can also help you hold your iPad correctly. A stand will provide support and help you maintain a neutral posture when working or reading, while a case will provide a comfortable grip that can prevent the iPad from slipping.\nIn conclusion, holding your iPad correctly is essential to avoid discomfort and strain on your muscles. By using both hands, keeping your iPad close to your body, and using a stand or case, you can enjoy your device without worrying about the pain that comes with holding it incorrectly. So, next time you reach for your iPad, remember to hold it the right way!\nThis article explains the different ways to correctly hold your iPad and the different benefits of each method. These instructions apply to all iPad models.\nWhat to Know\nPortrait: Hold the iPad with the shorter sides on top and bottom. This means the camera is on top.Landscape: Hold the iPad with the longer side on top and bottom. The volume buttons should be at the top.Photo or video: Have Home button at bottom or right of display to align back-facing camera to top of iPad. How to Hold the iPad in Portrait Mode Portrait mode, which means holding the iPad with a shorter side on top, works well for browsing the web or checking Facebook. Apple designed the iPad to make websites display better in portrait mode, which is how you typically hold your phone when browsing the web. When you hold it this way, keep the Home Button at the bottom, which puts it below the screen.\nThis orientation makes it easier to reach the Home button. It also puts the camera at the top, which makes placing video calls with FaceTime easier. It’s also the best orientation for taking selfies.\nIf the Home button is at the bottom, that puts the volume buttons at the upper-right and the suspend button on the top of the iPad. Holding the iPad upside-down may seem to work fine because the iPad flips the screen, but if the suspend button is at the bottom of the screen, it is easy to accidentally trigger it if you rest the iPad on a table or your lap.\nHow to Hold the iPad in Landscape Mode Landscape mode, which means holding the iPad with a longer side on top, is usually for games and watching videos. It can also make the text on the screen more prominent and comfortable to read without having to turn on Accessibility options.\nWhen using Landscape mode, the Home button is to the right of the display. The volume buttons are on top of the iPad, and the lock button is in the upper-left corner. It also conveniently leaves nothing on the bottom. Just like when you hold the device in portrait mode, keeping buttons off of that side of the iPad stops you from accidentally triggering them.\nThe iPad operates no matter how you orient it. But these positions make the buttons more accessible and let you rest the tablet on a surface without accidentally changing the volume or locking the device.\nHow to Hold the iPad While Taking Photos or Capturing Video These rules of placing the Home Button either at the bottom of the display in Portrait mode or to the right of the screen in Landscape mode also apply when taking photos or videos with the iPad. Having the Home Button at the bottom or to the right of the display aligns the back-facing camera to the top of the iPad.\nIf the camera is at the bottom of the iPad, it is easier to accidentally get your fingers in the way when you hold the tablet. If you grip the iPad in the middle and hold it near your chest or face, your hands and wrists might interfere with the rear-facing camera.\nWant to use Landscape mode or Portrait mode, but find your iPad is stuck in one orientation? Find out what to do when your iPad doesn’t rotate.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"947","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-26T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-26T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sarah Thayer"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-hold-the-ipad-correctly544805/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Are You Holding Your iPad All Wrong?
