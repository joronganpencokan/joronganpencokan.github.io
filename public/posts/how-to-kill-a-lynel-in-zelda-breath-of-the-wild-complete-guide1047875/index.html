With their size, power, and intimidating presence, encountering a Lynel can be a daunting experience for any adventurer. But fear not! With the right strategy, you can take down these beasts and claim their valuable loot. In this complete guide, we’ll reveal the ultimate Lynel-slaying strategy in Zelda: Breath of the Wild. So if you’re ready to conquer the wild, read on!\nStep 1: Be Prepared\nBefore facing a Lynel, it’s vital to be prepared. Bring along the right gear and items to aid you in battle. Here’s what you’ll need:\nArmor: Wear armor with high defense ratings. The best armor for facing Lynels is the Barbarian Armor set, which increases your attack power. Weapons: Use weapons that are made of sturdy materials, such as metal or Guardian parts. Lynels are tough opponents, and you’ll need weapons that can withstand their attacks. Arrows: Bring plenty of arrows (at least 20-30) that deal high damage, such as bomb arrows. Food: Cook dishes that boost your attack power and defense, such as Mighty or Tough recipes. Also, bring along cooked meals that will restore your health during battle. Elixirs: Make elixirs that give you resistance to fire and electricity. Lynels can use both types of attacks, and being immune will give you a significant advantage. Step 2: Scout Your Opponent\nBefore engaging a Lynel in battle, take the time to scout your opponent. Watch their movements and attacks, and take note of their weaknesses. Lynels have different elemental weaknesses (ice, fire, and electricity) depending on their color. For example, Red Lynels are weak to ice, while Silver Lynels are weak to fire.\nStep 3: Engage in Battle\nNow that you’re prepared and have scouted your opponent, it’s time to engage in battle. Here’s the ultimate Lynel-slaying strategy:\nShoot the Lynel in the face: Start the battle by using your Bow to shoot the Lynel in the face. This will stun them and give you time to attack. Mount the Lynel: When the Lynel is stunned, run up to them and jump on their back. You can mount them by pressing the attack button repeatedly. Attack with your melee weapon: While mounted on the Lynel, attack them with your melee weapon. Be careful not to exhaust your weapon’s durability too quickly. When the Lynel starts to shake, jump off before they throw you off their back. Use your Bow and Arrow: During the battle, use your Bow and Arrow to damage the Lynel from a distance. Aim for their elemental weak spot to deal extra damage. Use bomb arrows to create explosions that deal significant damage to the Lynel. Use your Runes: You can also use your Runes (Stasis or Magnesis) to stun the Lynel briefly. This will give you time to attack or flee if necessary. Dodge and parry: Lynels have powerful attacks that can deal massive damage. Learn their attack patterns and dodge or parry them using your Shield. Step 4: Collect the Loot\nAfter you’ve defeated the Lynel, collect their valuable loot. Lynels drop rare items, such as Lynel Horns, Guts, and Hooves, which you can use to upgrade your armor and cook powerful dishes.\nIn conclusion, with the right preparation and strategy, you can defeat Lynels and claim their loot in Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Remember to be prepared, scout your opponent, and use your Bow and Arrow, melee weapons, and Runes in battle. With these tips, you’ll be able to unleash the ultimate Lynel-slaying strategy and conquer the wild like a true adventurer!\nAfter mentioning BoTW Lynel locations in the previous guide, we have come up with another guide explaining you how to defeat a Lynel in Zelda. Before we delve deeper into how to beat Lynel in Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you will have to be very active and get prepared before you decide to fight with Lynel. Their move set is varied including physical strikes, archery, and magic.\nGet Prepared to Defeat Lynel Be sure to have a lot of health items (Hint: Cook any fruit + big hearty radish for max heart restoration plus multiple temporary hearts), fairies, and defense or attack elixirs. Yes, Lynel in Zelda have potential to cause tremendous amount of damage to you.\nIn order to be saved or reduce Lynel’s attack damage, You will have to get max upgraded armor (★★★★) or max upgraded jewelry (eg. Amber Earrings). In order to get them, you need to get unlocked all four Great Fairy Fountains.\nGet Close to Lynel When you get closure to Lynel, it will have a heavy swing, a cross slash, or jump back and runs towards you. What all you can do is to stop him to use your Stasis rune as she charges to land a few good strikes (this doesn’t last long, so be quick). Now, wait until it runs past you and then attack it from from behind so when it reanimates, you aren’t in the way of its weapon.\nNotably, staying close to Lynel and mastering Perfect Parry is key Lynel Combat. Undoubtedly, using shield and one handed weapon is the safest combination which you must use against a Lynel.\nIf you managed to execute a Perfect Perry, you will be able to open up the Lynel’s defense and can cause huge damage to him. The process might take a little bit time but it is worth.\nNote: While using a shield, you should use a single -handed sword. Using The Master Sword is highly recommended.\nIf you create distance between you and Lynel it may give him invitation to showcase its archery skills and you’d better believe they are pinpoint accurate. We would recommend you not to challenge him from a distance.\nBe smart while fighting with Lynel If you are expert and feels confident with a bow, hitting in the head of Lynel with stun it. Using a bow that fires multiple arrows simultaneously makes this a tad easier. Using Ice Arrows or stasis will freeze the Lynel temporarily. If you get close enough, you mount it and cause additional damage!\nDuring the fight, the Lynel may trigger some fire magic that will either send three fire blasts your way or create an explosion. So be safe and maintain some distance while fighting. If there is a natural obstruction (i.e. a rock), put it between you and the Lynel during these fire attacks, if you can.\nIf the grass catches fire, it will creates an updraft that you can use by jumping into it and pressing x to active your paraglider. You can then use Y to nock an arrow and launch an airborne assault (aim for its head)!\nWhen the lynel is defeated or killed, it drops its weapons and some body parts that are needed for armor upgrades. Lynel weapons are powerful and durable, so you will surely want to try them out!\nMore Tips to Beat Lynel In order to identify which color the Lynel is, you can use the Camera rune before you get close to it. Backflip dodging the Lynel’s swipe attack will trigger a Flurry Rush. If the Lynel is charging without its weapon drawn, what best you can do is to use your shield (hold ZL), and it will back off – buying you more time for your Stasis to recharge. An alternative to the shield counter is timing a sidestep correctly, which will trigger a Flurry Rush. When the Lynel starts charging its stomp attack (while stationary), sprint out of the area of effect, or shoot arrows in its head to stun it. That’s all you must know to beat Lynel in Zelda.\n","wordCount":"1304","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-28T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alejandro Burrows"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-kill-a-lynel-in-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-complete-guide1047875/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unleash the Ultimate Lynel-Slaying Strategy in Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Conquer the Wild with This Complete Guide!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 28, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1304 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Alejandro Burrows</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#get-prepared-to-defeat-lynel>Get Prepared to Defeat Lynel</a><ul><li><a href=#get-close-to-lynel>Get Close to Lynel</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#be-smart-while-fighting-with-lynel>Be smart while fighting with Lynel</a><ul><li><a href=#more-tips-to-beat-lynel>More Tips to Beat Lynel</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Unleash the Ultimate Lynel-Slaying Strategy in Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Conquer the Wild with This Complete Guide!</p><p>Lynels are one of the most formidable enemies in Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
