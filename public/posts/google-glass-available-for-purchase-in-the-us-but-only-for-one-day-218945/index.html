Google Glass is Back for ONE DAY Only in the US – Don’t Miss Out! Are you ready to catch the latest edition of Google Glass? Well, hold on to your hats as this time, Google Glass is back for only ONE DAY in the US. The updated version of Google Glass, dubbed the “Enterprise Edition 2” was originally released in May 2019 but it was only available to businesses through authorized resellers.\nOn the surface, the Enterprise Edition 2 looks very similar to its predecessor, the Google Glass Explorer Edition, which was released back in 2013. However, the Enterprise Edition 2 is packed with new and improved hardware and software, including an upgraded camera, an improved battery life, faster charging, and a better display.\nSo why is Google Glass only back for one day and available to the public? Unfortunately, the one-day sale is only for the original Google Glass Explorer Edition, with the hardware and software that was released back in 2013. Nonetheless, it’s still an exciting opportunity to own a piece of technological history.\nThe original Google Glass Explorer Edition had a limited release, only sold for a limited amount of time at a whopping $1,500 each. Despite being heavily criticized for its privacy issues, the ability to take pictures and videos of others without their permission, and the overall “awkwardness” of wearing the device, the Google Glass was still an impressive technological achievement.\nFlash forward to 2021, and Google Glass has come a long way. The Enterprise Edition 2 has been heavily redesigned for business applications, and is no longer intended for consumer use. It has been designed to improve efficiency for workers by enabling hands-free use, and is targeted at specific industries such as logistics, manufacturing, and healthcare.\nWhile the one-day sale of the original Google Glass Explorer Edition may be a little disappointing for some technologies enthusiasts, it’s an exciting opportunity to own a piece of tech history. Who knows, you could be one of the few people on the planet who owns a Google Glass Explorer Edition.\nSo, what’s the catch? The original Google Glass Explorer Edition is only available for one day, on Friday, April 16th, starting at 10 am EST. This is a limited time sale, and there are only a limited number of devices available. If you want to get your hands on one, you’ll have to act fast.\nIn conclusion, if you’re a tech enthusiast, don’t miss out on this exciting opportunity to own a piece of technological history. The Google Glass is back for one day, and you could be one of the lucky few to own one. Mark your calendars for Friday, April 16th at 10 am EST, and don’t miss out on this limited time sale.\nOn Tuesday, April 15th, and only for one day, Google is planning to get Glass on the hands of as many people as possible. According to the Google+ account for Glass, the search giant will open up and make available Google Glass for purchase. The promotional offer to become an Explorer is limited for one day, only U.S. customers will be able to make a purchase, and everyone will have to pay $1,500 plus tax to get the kit.\nGoogle is even bundling Glass with a pair of shades or frame. Although anyone will be able to purchase a Google Glass on April 15th, you’ll have to make your purchase as early as possible as “the number of spots available is limited” — Google says.\nThis is a big chance for many customers that wanted to become an Explorer for a long time. Previous Glass Explorer programs were very limited, back in 2012 Google opened up pre-order for the first time, then other marketing campaigns came along to make Glass available; they involved knowing the right person to get a referral or getting into the wait list. However the next campaign comes to show that Google is getting closer to release Google Glass to the masses — although this one it’s just for one day.\nFor more information visit this page: http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one/\nUpdate: U.S. customers will able to purchase Google Glass starting Tuesday, April 15th, 2014 at 9am EDT. But remember that it’s a 24 hours limited time only.
