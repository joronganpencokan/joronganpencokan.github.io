Perhaps you’ve upgraded from an older version of Windows and found that some of your favorite features are no longer there, or maybe you’ve just noticed that your new PC is missing some functionality. Whatever the reason, don’t worry - getting your missing Windows 10 features back is easier than you think!\nStep 1: Check for updates\nFirst, make sure that your operating system is fully up-to-date. Microsoft has been pushing out regular updates for Windows 10 since its release, and many of these updates include new features and functionality. To check for updates, go to “Settings” \u003e “Update \u0026 Security” \u003e “Windows Update.” From here, you can check for updates and install any that are available.\nStep 2: Use the Windows 10 built-in features\nWindows 10 includes a number of built-in features that may be able to replace some of the missing functionality you’re looking for. For example, the “Task View” feature introduced in Windows 10 can be used as a replacement for the “Alt + Tab” window switcher from previous versions of Windows. Similarly, the “Snap Assist” feature can be used to snap windows to specific areas of the screen.\nTo access these features, simply use the search bar in your taskbar to search for the feature you want to use. For example, type “Task View” into the search bar to access that feature.\nStep 3: Download third-party software\nIf you can’t find a built-in replacement for the feature you’re missing, don’t worry - there’s likely a third-party software solution available. A quick Google search for the missing feature should reveal a number of options for software that can do what you need.\nFor example, if you’re missing the classic Windows 7 Start menu, you can download a third-party Start menu replacement like Classic Shell or Start10. If you’re missing Windows Media Center, you can download the Kodi media center software instead.\nStep 4: Customize Windows 10 to your liking\nFinally, remember that Windows 10 is highly customizable. There are a number of ways you can tweak the operating system to work exactly the way you want it to.\nFor example, you can use the “Personalization” menu to change your desktop background, taskbar color, and more. You can also use the “Ease of Access” menu to configure accessibility options like high-contrast mode and narrator.\nIn conclusion, getting your missing Windows 10 features back is surprisingly easy. With a little bit of effort, you can restore the functionality you loved from previous versions of Windows or find new, third-party solutions that work just as well. So don’t give up on Windows 10 just because of a missing feature - you have plenty of options for getting what you need!\nWell, Windows 10 updates are good, but they often ruin things for a desktop user. After installing a new Windows 10 update, users often face problems like glitches, bugs, system crashes, BSOD errors, and more.

Under the Taskbar Settings, enable the option ‘Use Smaller taskbar buttons’. Once done, you will see the Windows search bar on the taskbar.\n3. Restore the missing taskbar If you cannot find the taskbar, make sure that it’s not hidden. Maybe the Windows 10 update has enabled the ‘Auto Hide’ feature of the taskbar.

If the taskbar pops up, right-click on the taskbar and select ‘Taskbar settings.’ On the taskbar settings, disable the ‘Automatically hide the taskbar in desktop mode’ option.\nYou can also right-click on the taskbar and select the ‘Lock the taskbar option.
