There are quite a few options, but some popular ones include:\nAnyFont iFont Fonteer These apps allow you to install custom fonts on your iPhone, and they can also modify existing fonts.\nStep 2: Find the Font You Want to Install Once you’ve downloaded a font app, you’ll need to find a font you like. There are plenty of sites where you can download fonts for free, such as FontSpace, DaFont, or 1001 Fonts. You can search for different styles, such as script, sans-serif, and serif fonts. Once you’ve chosen the font you want, download it to your iPhone.\nStep 3: Install the Font App To install fonts on iOS 13, you’ll need to install the font app first. Once you’ve downloaded the app, open it, and select the font you want to install. Follow the instructions to install the font, which may vary depending on the app you’re using.\nStep 4: Use Your New Font Now that you’ve installed a new font, it’s time to use it. Go to the Settings app on your iPhone and tap on Display \u0026 Brightness. From there, select the option for Fonts. Here, you’ll see a list of all the installed fonts on your iPhone. Tap on the font you want to use, and it will automatically apply to your iPhone’s system font.\nStep 5: Enjoy Your New Look Congratulations, you’ve successfully installed a new font on your iPhone! Enjoy your new unique look, and experiment with different fonts to find the perfect one for you.\nIn conclusion, installing new fonts on iOS 13 is an easy and fun way to personalize the look of your iPhone. With a wide variety of font apps and free font downloads, the possibilities are endless. So, go ahead and transform your iPhone’s look today!\nInstalling fonts on the iPhone has long been something owners could do but iOS 13 took that functionality to the next level. During Apple’s introduction of iOS 13 and iPadOS, the company introduced custom fonts for your devices. It remains a rather limited feature in that it isn’t system-wide, but it’s definitely a step in the right direction. Apple, long known for its walled garden, has been hesitant to provide its customers with deep internal access to its software. Previously, apps available in the App Store were able to work some magic and install fonts, but iOS 13/iPadOS mark the first time Apple is officially supporting installation. Here’s how to get your own fonts on Apple’s latest software.\nFind the Font Manager Before you get into installing custom fonts, you need to know where to find them. Let’s start with the most important thing to know. Custom fonts can only be installed in a small group of apps. When we say small, we mean small. As of right now, custom fonts are really only going to be good for Apple’s own apps like Mail, Keynote, Numbers and Pages. Adobe has promised support for custom fonts in their Photoshop and Illustrator apps in the future. Now, that’s not to say that custom fonts cannot be used in third-party apps. They can but not as part of the default interface.\nNow that we have that covered, how do you find the font manager? Let’s start with Mail.app as it’s a good starting point.\nTo access the font menu, begin drafting an email and tap anywhere in the body of the message. When you do that, the keyboard pops up.\nIn the very top row at the far right is a “\u003c” symbol. Tap on it. Now you’ll see a bunch of options. Find the one on the left which is “Aa”. Tap on that.\nA menu will appear that replaces the keyboard with another bunch of options. Find “Default Font” in the left column and click on it. Once you do that, you’ll see all of the available font options you can choose from that can appear in the Mail app.\nAfter you install new custom fonts, they will appear automatically in this list.\nDownload Custom Fonts from App Store Once we know how to install custom fonts, we then need to find them. Fortunately, this is as easy as going to the App Store. There is a number of popular app options to install custom fonts including Adobe’s Creative Cloud, which can add 1,300 additional fonts for free. Apps like Font Diner and Fonteer also provide custom font selections.\nInstalling Custom Fonts To make things easy, start with the Adobe Creative Cloud app to begin installing custom fonts. To get going, just follow the below steps.\nOpen Adobe’s app on your iPhone or iPad as long as you have iOS 13.1 or later installed on your device.\nGo to the “Fonts” tab in the app.\nTap “Install Fonts”.\nAn iOS system menu will appear. Tap on “Install” to begin the installation process.\nYou can now look at the entire list of font options. When you find a font you would like to add, click “Install Fonts” and add each font individually. With 1,300 fonts available, there are plenty of unique options so feel free to peruse the whole list.\nOnce the fonts are downloaded, they are automatically installed on the device. There is really nothing else you need to do at this point.\nManaging Custom Fonts No matter which app you use, all of your custom fonts are managed in the same place. This goes for both iPhone and iPad. To find the fonts, head over to “Settings -\u003e General -\u003e Fonts”. From here you can see all of your existing custom fonts. What happens if you want to delete a font? That is easy. From the Font menu under settings, simply swipe left on any font in the list and then tap “Delete”. Once you hit delete, it will immediately be removed from the device. If you would prefer to delete multiple fonts at once, tap “Edit” in the top right corner and select which fonts you want to remove. When you make your selection, tap “Remove” at the bottom of the screen.\nConclusion Unfortunately, Apple’s font installation process shows just how much more progress we need to make in breaking down its walled garden. It would be excellent if fonts could be installed and used in every app and menu throughout your device. That might happen at some point too. For now, Apple continues to take baby steps in the right direction with device personalization. Hopefully, this is just a glimpse of the type of freedom that will come in future iOS software releases.\n12 of the Best Siri Shortcuts for iOS Power UsersHow to Set Live Wallpapers on an iPhone David is a freelance tech writer with over 15 years of experience in the tech industry.
