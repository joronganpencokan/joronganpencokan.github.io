Transcription can be a tedious and time-consuming process, but luckily, technology has made it easier than ever to convert audio files to text. And the best part? It’s surprisingly easy to do!\nThere are now a plethora of tools and software available that can convert your audio files to text quickly and accurately. But before we dive into the different options available, let’s explore why you might need to convert an audio file to text in the first place.\nWhy convert audio files to text?\nTranscribing audio files to text is crucial for a variety of reasons. It can be useful for:\ncaptioning videos for the deaf or hard-of-hearing creating subtitles for foreign languages transcribing notes from an interview or lecture creating a text archive of a podcast or radio show generating a searchable transcript for content creators However, transcribing audio files manually can be a time-consuming and tiring task. That’s why audio to text conversion software has become so popular in recent years, offering a fast and efficient alternative.\nHow to convert audio files to text\nThere are many different audio to text conversion tools available, ranging from free online services to high-end software suites. Here are some of the most popular options:\nOnline transcription services: Websites like Rev.com and GoTranscript.com offer paid transcription services that can convert your audio files to text quickly and accurately. All you need to do is upload your audio file and wait for your transcript to be delivered.\nTranscription software: Companies like Dragon Speech Recognition and Transcribe.com offer software packages for audio to text transcription. These programs use artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to transcribe audio files in real-time.\nAutomatic transcription tools: There are many free online tools available that offer automatic transcription services. These tools use AI-generated transcripts, but they may not always be 100% accurate.\nNo matter which option you choose, audio to text conversion has become much easier and more accessible than ever before.\nTips for successful audio to text conversion\nWhile audio to text conversion can be a fast and easy process, there are a few tips you can follow to ensure the best results:\nChoose high-quality audio files: While most conversion tools can handle lower quality audio files, you’ll get the best results if you use high-quality files with minimal background noise.\nEdit your transcription: Even the best algorithms can make mistakes, so it’s essential to review and edit your transcripts to ensure accuracy.\nConsider using human transcription services: While AI has come a long way, human transcribers are best suited to handle complex dialogue or conversations.\nIn conclusion, audio to text conversion is a lifesaver for anyone who needs to transcribe audio files quickly and accurately. With a variety of online services and software packages available, there’s no excuse for not trying it out. And who knows? You might just be surprised by how easy it is!\nThere are so many uses out there for text-to-speech software and speech-to-text software. Whether you want to narrate stories, give dictation or use voice search, these apps help. You may also need to convert an audio file to text. It; could be about documenting the text notes of an interview or transcribing a video for uploading on YouTube.\nHere are several options to help you achieve audio-to-text conversion in quick and easy steps.\n1. Office 365/Word Microsoft Word has some handy built-in functions for transcribing audio files. Instead of holding a speaker up to your PC microphone and playing it that way, Word can directly transcribe straight from your audio files.\nOf course, you need an Office 365 or Office subscription for this to work (though there are some workarounds to get Office working for free, even if temporarily). Of all the options on this list, this is the cleanest, and from our experience, the most accurate way to transcribe audio on your PC.\nTo transcribe using Word, sign in to Office 365 on your browser and open a new Word document.\nClick Home, then the drop-down icon next to ‘”Dictate” (or the microphone icon) and “Transcribe.”\nClick “Upload audio,” then select the file you want to transcribe and wait for the process to finish.\nYou can then click “Add to document” at the bottom and choose the desired format for the transcription in your Word document.\n2. Google Docs Alternatively, you can convert audio to text using Google’s free cloud-based word processing software, Google Docs, which can also convert audio to text. Again, have your audio files playing loud and clear either on your PC or nearby device.\nIn Google Docs, go to “Tools -\u003e Voice typing” to turn on dictation. For Microsoft Word you need to turn on dictation/online speech recognition on macOS or Windows 10, then press the keyboard shortcut you set to turn on dictation (Win + H in Windows 10, Command key twice in Mac) and open Word.\nOnce you’ve set up dictation or voice typing, turn it on, open your word-processing software, then play the audio file into your PC microphone (or just play it on your PC so your mic picks it up).\n3. Bear File Converter If you want a simple audio-to-text conversion for brief notes, Bear File Converter has a decent option. Based on the Baidu recognition engine, it can do a proper job converting a clear audio with few distracting noises. However, the online software is not very accurate in converting MP3 song files to text. Also, the online software does not record for longer than three minutes.\n4. 360Converter If you’re looking for slightly better results online in audio-to-text conversion, 360converter offers a simple dashboard tool. It supports both audio and video. The results can be downloaded as a word file or PDF. There are limitations for the freeware, however. While the software is good enough to transcribe conversations and prerecorded speeches, you won’t get professional results.\n5. Sobolsoft If you’re aiming for professional results in MP3-to-text conversion, Sobolsoft offers better output. There are no time limits in terms of output and intuitive options which allow you to convert multiple files and split the timelines. The results are far better than previous options. However, you need to make a purchase beforehand, although a free trial is available.\n6. InqScribe Although it does not directly convert audio to text, InqScribe is an intuitive digital transcription tool which makes the manual entry as easy as possible. With this software, you can quickly insert timecodes anywhere in the transcript and work the rest just like a word processor. You can assign keyboard shortcuts and insert snippet variables to drop frequently-used text with a single keystroke. A complete product user guide is available at this link.\nInqScribe is not free, but a 14-day free trial is available without the need to enter payment methods.\nConverting audio to text is still a manual job in the music industry, and studios hire professional transcribers for accurate results. YouTubers usually add subtitles and captions on a video-editing software. However, the above solutions enable a degree of automation.\nFor more acoustic tips on Windows, see our guide for fixing your headphones when they’re not working.
