Do you have business meetings with clients who speak a different language? Perhaps you have foreign friends and family that you might have a difficult time conversing with.\nWell, fear not! With the help of modern technology, there has never been a better time to connect with people from around the world. There are a plethora of innovative iOS apps which can turn your language barrier into a bridge.\nHere are four of the best iOS apps available that can help you overcome your language troubles!\nDuolingo Duolingo is a highly popular iOS app that allows you to learn new languages. It provides a variety of fun exercises, including quizzes and writing tasks, to help you master new grammar rules, vocabulary, and pronunciation. What’s great is that it offers a virtual coaching system that tracks your progress, and adjusts itself to your learning pace. Whether you are starting with a new language or want to perfect your existing skills, Duolingo is the perfect app for students of all levels.\nGoogle Translate Google Translate helps you translate text, images and voice in more than dozens of languages. You can snap pictures or type in the text, and it will translate it into your native language instantaneously. This app also offers the feature to save translated sentences for future reference. Furthermore, it can translate conversations in real-time- just speak into your phone and it translates for you! Traveling just got so much easier with Google Translate!\nBabbel Babbel is a great app for both beginners and intermediate-level learners. This app contains a myriad of speaking, listening, writing, and reading exercises. It also offers interactive conversation simulations with native speakers, as well as audio and video recordings to improve your sentence structure and pronunciation. All user data, including the state of the language skill, is also saved on the app, making it easier for users to track their achievements.\niTranslate iTranslate is an iOS app that offers translations in over 100 languages. You can easily translate text, voice and handwriting into your target language, making it perfect for people who need quick translations on-the-go. One of the best features of iTranslate is its ability to save translations, making it easy to access the sentences or phrases you need repeatedly.\nIn conclusion, language barriers can be easy to conquer with the right tools- and with all the iOS apps available at your fingertips, there is no excuse to let language hold you back from communicating with the world. Whether you’re a student looking to learn a new language, a businessperson needing to communicate with clients abroad, or just traveling the world- these four iOS apps- Duolingo, Google Translate, Babbel, and iTranslate- can be your life-saving bridge. Happy travels!\nThe more business that is being doing via Internet, the more it’s being done internationally. Being able to conduct business via email, text, and social networks means people are reaching out to people in other countries that might be speaking a different language.\nWhile we used to use books and translators to help translate, these are no longer necessary, as mobile devices can serve as great translators whether doing business or traveling. The following is a selection of free iOS apps that will help you translate many different languages. Not all apps that were demoed worked; those have been omitted from this list.\n1. Google Translate If you’re on your computer and in need of a quick translation, most likely you’re looking it up on Google. Why not do the same with an app? Google Translate is as simple as it gets. Simply choose the language you are starting and ending with, and insert the word, phrase, or section of text that needs translating. The app allows you to save some of your favorite translations, which will come in handy if you’re traveling. The translated phrases can also be spoken aloud by the app\nGoogle Translate\n2. iTranslate The iTranslate app gives you just a little more, and if you also want even more and no ads, you can pay in app. $2.99 will get rid of all the ads, and $0.99 will allow you for voice recognition so that you can speak the words you want translated. Like Google Translate, it also allows you to save a list of favorite words and phrases. In addition it has a history of the words and phrases you have translated and allows you to easily email the resulting translations.\niTranslate\n3. myLanguage Free Translator Like iTranslate, the myLanguage Free Translator app has both a free version and paid version. For $4.99, you will gain the option of text-to-speech. Like the other apps you can choose to translate to and from many languages. Additionally, you can share the results by email or SMS, or to Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn.\nmyLanguage Free Translator\n4. SpeakText FREE The SpeakText FREE app can seemingly do it all. Not only can it translate sections of text that you type or paste in, it can also translate documents and websites. SpeakText FREE will also read aloud documents and websites without translating them. With the websites and documents, it breaks it down into sections of text. If you choose to just have it speak the text, it will show you the text along with a button to have it spoken. There is also an option to have the text translated at this point. Or you can just have it translated from the beginning. It will still choose sections of text, but will show the translation and allow you to have it spoken if you wish. The benefit of this is that instead of getting a large block of translated text that you don’t understand at all, it shows you the original and translated text next to each other in small sections to help you better understand what is being said.\nSpeakText FREE\nHaving one of these apps pre-loaded on your iPhone or iPad means you’ll never be caught in a frenzied state trying to figure out what people are saying when they’re speaking a different language, when you’re viewing a website that is unexpectedly in a different language, or when receiving a document that is written in a language that is unfamiliar to you.\nLaura has spent nearly 20 years writing news, reviews, and op-eds, with more than 10 of those years as an editor as well. She has exclusively used Apple products for the past three decades. In addition to writing and editing at MTE, she also runs the site’s sponsored review program.\nOur latest tutorials delivered straight to your inbox\n","wordCount":"1125","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Joseph Lavigne"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/handy-ios-apps-for-language-translation1888927/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Transform Your Language Barrier into a Bridge with These Life-Saving iOS Apps!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 10, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1125 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Joseph Lavigne</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-google-translate>1.
