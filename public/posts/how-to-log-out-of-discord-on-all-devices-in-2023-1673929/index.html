Discord, the popular gaming communication platform, has just released their most anticipated update yet! The update comes with various new features and improvements, including the ability to log out of Discord on all devices at once, which is a feature that users have been eagerly awaiting for a long time.\nFor those who are not familiar with Discord, it is a communication platform primarily designed for gamers. It allows users to chat, voice and video call, share files and screen, and create and join servers. With over 250 million users worldwide, Discord is undoubtedly one of the most popular gaming communication platforms available today.\nOne of the biggest problems that Discord users have been facing is the inability to log out of their accounts on all devices at once. This could lead to privacy and security issues, especially if someone else accesses their account from a different device. Fortunately, Discord has listened to their users’ feedback and has now introduced a solution to this problem.\nThe new update allows users to log out of Discord on all devices at once, ensuring that their account is secure and safe from unauthorized access. This means that users can easily manage their account from one device, log out of it, and have the peace of mind that their account is secure on all other devices.\nTo log out of Discord on all devices at once, users can follow these simple steps:\nOpen Discord on your computer or mobile device Click on your profile picture or the user settings icon in the lower-left corner of the screen Click on the “Account” tab Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the “Log Out of All Devices” button Confirm by clicking on “Log Out” It’s that simple! With this new feature, users can now easily log out of their Discord accounts on all devices, ensuring their account’s safety and privacy.\nIn conclusion, Discord’s most anticipated update has brought various new features and improvements, including the ability to log out of Discord on all devices at once. This feature is a game-changer for the platform, ensuring its users’ safety and privacy. So, what are you waiting for? Try out this new feature today and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing your account is secure!\nLet’s admit the fact that everyone’s Discord account is special to them. Usually, there is a lot of personal data and private chats in someone’s Discord account which can be too important to lose. But a little bit of carelessness from your side can get your account compromised. Moreover, once you lose your account, the process of getting it back can be really hectic and time-consuming. So, whenever you have an intuition that your account is compromised, the best thing you can do is log out of Discord on all the devices. By doing that, you can make sure that your account isn’t being used on a device that is not yours. But unfortunately, there’s no direct way on Discord for doing that.\nSo, does that mean that you can’t log out of all Discord live sessions remotely using any one device? Well, that is not true, as there are other ways to achieve that same thing and too in a very short time. And in this article, we’re going to discuss those same methods. Yes! You can thank us later.\nRecommended: How To Block Someone On Discord\nLog Out Of Discord On All Devices There are basically two methods with which you can do this, and both of them are really easy to follow.\n1. Change Your Discord Password Apparently, when you change your Discord password using one of your devices, you automatically get logged out of all the other devices. So, after that, you have to input your new password to log in to your Discord account on all those devices. This is something that also happens when you change the password of your social media accounts like Facebook or Twitter. So, you might already be familiar with this method.\n2. Enable/Disable Two-Factor Authentication If you have a special bond with your current password and you don’t want to change it, then don’t worry because you have another option. So, what you can do, is enable the Two-Factor authentication for your Discord account. When you enable that, you have to input a 6 digit code along with your password every time you want to login to Discord. And to initiate this process, Discord automatically logs you out from all the devices. So, by following this method, you can make your account more secure while also achieving your main objective.\nBut what if you’ve already enabled the Two-factor authentication on your account? Well, then don’t worry because you can still sign out of Discord from all the other devices by disabling the two-factor authentication. However, I would suggest enabling it again after you’re done logging out of Discord.\nLog Out Of Discord On Android The thing I’ve personally noticed is that logging out of Discord can be confusing if you’re using the Android app. And this is because unlike the Desktop or the iOS app, the Discord Android app has the ‘Log out icon’ instead of the straightforward ‘Log Out‘ option, which most people are unaware of. So, if you’re someone who doesn’t know how you can get to the logout icon on the Discord android app, then follow these steps:\nFirst, tap on the Settings/Cog icon to open your profile settings.\nNow, this is where you’ll be able to see the Logout icon. It will be on the top right corner of the screen along with the three-dot icon. Just tap on it to logout of your Discord account.\nRecommended: How To Show What Game You’re Playing On Discord\nWrapping Up If you were getting desperate to sign out of Discord on all the devices, then one of the above methods must have worked for you. Also, changing the password or enabling Two-factor authentication on Discord also tighten the security of your account. So basically, following either of the methods is good for your Discord account anyway.\n","wordCount":"1048","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-25T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-25T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jacqueline Dash"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-log-out-of-discord-on-all-devices-in-2023-1673929/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Discord just released their most anticipated update yet - Learn how to log out of Discord on all devices once and for all in 2023!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-25 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 25, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1048 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jacqueline Dash</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#log-out-of-discord-on-all-devices>Log Out Of Discord On All Devices</a><ul><li><a href=#1-change-your-discord-password>1.
