If you do, you are probably already familiar with Boomerang videos, a popular feature on this social media platform.\nBoomerang videos are short, looping videos that play forwards, then backwards, creating a never-ending loop. They are fun, quirky and a great way to add some movement and interest to your social media posts.\nThe best part? You don’t need an advanced camera or editing skills to create Boomerang videos. You can make them on almost any smartphone, as long as you have the right tools and techniques.\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to make Boomerang videos on any phone, to unleash your inner Instagram star:\n##Step 1: Download the Boomerang App\nTo create Boomerang videos, you need to download the Boomerang App. It’s a free app that is available on both the App Store and Google Play.\nOnce you have downloaded the app, open it on your phone, and you will be ready to start creating some fun Boomerang videos.\n##Step 2: Choose Your Subject\nWhen creating a Boomerang video, you will only have a few seconds to capture the right moment. Choose a subject that is eye-catching and will work well for a video that loops back and forth.\nSome popular subjects include people jumping, throwing something in the air, or even simply waving at the camera. The more movement there is, the better the Boomerang video will look.\n##Step 3: Stay Steady\nTo create a smooth Boomerang video, you need to keep your phone steady. Use both hands and try to keep the camera as still as possible.\nIf you are moving while filming, it will create a jerky and choppy effect, which will not look as good when it loops back and forth.\n##Step 4: Press Record\nOnce you have your subject and are ready to go, simply press the record button. The Boomerang video will be a short burst of images that are taken quickly, creating the looped video.\nRemember to keep filming for a few seconds after your subject has completed their motion, to allow enough time for the video to loop back around.\n##Step 5: Edit and Share\nOnce you have created your Boomerang video, the app will automatically save it to your camera roll. You can then edit the video further by trimming it down or adding filters.\nWhen you are happy with your Boomerang video, share it to Instagram or any other social media platform. Watch as your followers like and share the fun and looping video.\nIn conclusion, Boomerang videos are a great way to bring some life and excitement to your social media posts. You don’t need any fancy equipment, just your smartphone and the Boomerang app. Follow these easy steps, have fun, and unleash your inner Instagram star today!\nBoomerang videos are booming across social media platforms as some of the most sharable content available. While some apps allow you to create these mini clips from scratch, others turn your old videos into a Boomerang within seconds. This article looks at some of the best apps and methods to create Boomerangs.\nWhat Is a Boomerang Video? Boomerang videos are basically short looping clips that don’t last more than a few seconds. The ability to Boomerang videos was designed initially by Instagram and became wildly popular.\nEven if you’re not a user of the photo-centric app, there are many other apps available to make Boomerangs with. Most of them are not difficult to use, so it comes down to which apps have the best features.\n1. Instagram and Boomerang Creating a Boomerang using Instagram on mobile is super easy – you can do it in seconds. The same can be said for Boomerang, which is an independent app from Instagram that basically offers the same functionality outside of Instagram.\nIn the Instagram app, swipe left in your main feed to bring up the camera.Select the Boomerang option from the menu on the left.\nPress the button at the bottom to start recording.\nOnce the clip is done, you can apply video effects, including Slow Mo and Duo, by pressing the Boomerang icon at the top.\nNext, apply filters, stickers and other decorations and press Done.\nPress the “Send to” button to send it to friends or post is as your Story.\nWith the Boomerang app, the process is the same (minus the first two steps), although you don’t have the option to add filters or any other kind of decoration to your clip – unless you import it to Instagram.\n2. Facebook Messenger Facebook owns Instagram, and the two are quite intertwined, so there’s no surprise that the former also offers a Boomerang option through its Messenger app for Android and iOS.\nOpen a chat in the Messenger app.Tap on the Camera button in the lower part of the display.\nSwipe right at the bottom and select the Boomerang option.\nPress the button below to start recording.Add various enhancements by tapping on the options in the upper-right corner, then press done.\nIf you don’t want to add anything, simply press the “Send” button to share it with a friend or save it as your Story.\n3. WhatsApp Interestingly enough, you can create a quick Boomerang-like clip with WhatsApp as well. Here’s how to do it on Android and iOS.\nOpen a chat in WhatsApp.Tap the camera icon at the bottom to bring up the camera.\nLong-press on the button in the lower part of the display to start shooting.\nWhen you’re done shooting, lift your finger. You can add a few enhancements including stickers and text.\nChoose whether you want to share the clip as a video or GIF.\nPress Send and that’s it.\n4.

Here’s how to do that on your Android or IOS device.\nOpen the app and on the upper-right side of the display, tap on the little downward arrow to bring up more options.\nTap on Multi Snap.\nPress the large button at the bottom to start recording your clip.\nAfter you’ve completed the shoot, tap on the blue “Edit \u0026 Send” button at the bottom.\nYou can add all kinds of stuff to your clip, including text, stickers (even custom ones), links and more.\nOnce you’re satisfied, press the “Send To” button.\nYou can send the clip to individual users or have the app upload it as your Story.\n5. TikTok TikTok is a video-making app which has become increasingly popular in recent times. As you’d expect, the app can be used to create Boomerang-like mini clips.\nOpen the TIkTok app on your phone.Tap on the “+” button at the bottom of the display to start creating a video.\nBy default, TikTok lets you create videos that are 15 seconds, 60 seconds or 3 minutes long.

Users can take these directly from the camera app with the Live Photos option turned on. Once you have a live photo, the next step is to go to your phone’s Photos app. View the pic in question and set it to Bounce, which basically turns it into a Boomerang.\nOn Google’s Pixel devices, long-pressing the shutter button in the phone’s default camera app will result in live images. These can then be edited frame by frame using Google’s built-in tools.\n7. Reverse Movie FX Reverse Movie FX (Android | iOS) is an app which lets you create Boomerang clips from videos you already have stored on your device. Note that the app contains ads that pop up before and after you edit the video, but you can eliminate those with the Pro version for $2.49.\nCreating a Boomerang Video After you install the app, you can get started by clicking the reverse arrow on the home screen.\nChoose to either record a movie or upload an existing one.\nIf you’ve selected the second option, locate the folder containing your video and tap to select it.Cut the video by using the sliders at the bottom to select the starting and ending frame.\nPress Start\nChoose Options for Your Clip Select the direction you want the clip to go. You can make it reversed or a combination of your original video and the reversal.\nIf you’d like, add one of the many filters or some audio to your project.\nThe choice to use HD quality is only available in the Pro version.Click “Start Reversing.”\nAfter a few seconds, you can watch your new video, then share it on social networks, including TikTok, Instagram and Facebook.\n8.
