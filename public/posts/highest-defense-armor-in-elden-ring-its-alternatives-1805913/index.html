This upcoming action role-playing game has already taken the gaming world by storm, and fans can’t wait to get their hands on it when it launches. One of the most exciting aspects of the game is the armor system, which can offer a variety of benefits, including insane defense stats.\nLet’s take a closer look at the Elden Ring armor, and reveal some money-saving alternatives that can provide similar benefits.\nElden Ring Armor\nThe Elden Ring armor system is truly impressive, with a wide variety of armors available to the players. One of the most popular armors in the game is the Havel’s Armor Set, known for its insane defense stats. This armor set offers the highest physical defense in the game and is highly resistant to magic and lightning.\nHowever, the Havel’s Armor Set comes with a steep price tag, requiring players to fight their way through a challenging boss battle to obtain it. With its high damage absorption and resistance, the Havel’s Armor Set is a highly coveted set for endgame content.\nMoney-Saving Alternatives\nIf you’re not willing to spend hours grinding to get the Havel’s Armor Set, there are other armor sets you can use that offer similar benefits. For example, the Alva Set offers high defense and resistance while also being lighter and easier to obtain. The Alva Set can be acquired by defeating the Knight Alva in the Earthen Peak Ruins.\nAnother alternative is the Black Iron Set, which offers incredible defense and poise. This set can be acquired by defeating the Black Iron Tarkus in the Anor Londo fortress.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the Elden Ring armor system is one of the most exciting aspects of the game. The Havel’s Armor Set is undoubtedly one of the most sought-after sets, but it comes with a hefty price tag. If you’re looking for money-saving alternatives, the Alva Set and the Black Iron Set can offer similar benefits while being less challenging to obtain. Whatever armor you choose, make sure to strategize how you’ll use it to take down the toughest bosses.\nHaving the armor with the highest defense will allow you to take several hits in Elden Ring. Sometimes the ability to take some extra hits can be a deciding factor in a boss fight. That is where the defense comes in. While every armor provides you with some form of defense, choosing the right armor will change how you fight enemies. So in this guide let us check the best armor with the highest defense in the game and some other alternatives for it.\nArmor with Highest Defense in Elden Ring Lionel’s Set is the armor with the highest defense in the game. It is the armor that comes very close to Bull-Goat armor set in terms of defense and poise. Here are its stats.\nPoise: 79 Combined Weight: 50.7 Weight Damage Negation Physical: 38.3 Strike: 35.7 Slash: 42.2 Pierce: 43.4 Magic: 29.3 Fire: 32.4 Lightning: 28.2 Holy: 29.3 The bull-Goat armor set is good but serves the purpose of being the armor with the highest poise. If you check the stats of that armor and compare it with Lionel you will see Lionel’s Set is better than it in slash, pierce, magic, fire, and holy damage negation. There is also quite a big difference in the combined weight of these two armors.\nPhysical: 38.3 Strike: 35.7 Slash: 42.2 Pierce: 43.4 Magic: 29.3 Fire: 32.4 Lightning: 28.2 Holy: 29.3 You can get the Lionel’s Armor Set in Leyndell, Royal Capital. Fast travel to the Lower Capital Church site of grace. Here you can find the set on a bed along with the Deathbed dress.\nArmor options with High Defense If Lionel’s Set wasn’t to your liking then you should try these sets.\nBull-Goat Armor Set: This goes without saying but this is the second-best armor with the best defense. And as mentioned before you will get the highest poise in the game with it. If you don’t have it already then check our detailed guide on how to get the Bull-Goat Set. Veteran’s Set: This is a great option if you want a good defense, high poise, and lightweight armor. When compared to these previous two armors sets the combined weight of the Veteran’s Set is only 45. But it still gives you 79 poise. And the best part is it is quite easy to get as you can spend 18000 Runes to buy it from Enia. Do remember it will only be available after you kill Commander Niall. Thanks to Fextralife for the information about these armors.\nThat covers this guide on the best armor with the highest defense in Elden Ring and its alternate options. If you like playing this game and need help on some other topics then check out our Elden Ring section. We have many guides here on various builds, locations, weapons, and more.\n","wordCount":"836","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Roy Darnell"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/highest-defense-armor-in-elden-ring-its-alternatives-1805913/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't believe the insane defense stats of this Elden Ring armor, plus money-saving alternatives revealed!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 24, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;836 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Roy Darnell</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#armor-with-highest-defense-in-elden-ring>Armor with Highest Defense in Elden Ring</a><ul><li><a href=#armor-options-with-high-defense>Armor options with High Defense</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>You Won&rsquo;t Believe the Insane Defense Stats of This Elden Ring Armor, Plus Money-Saving Alternatives Revealed!</p><p>Are you ready for Elden Ring?
