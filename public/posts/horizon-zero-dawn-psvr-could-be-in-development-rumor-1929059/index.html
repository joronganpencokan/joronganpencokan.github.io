Are you ready to embark on a thrilling journey across an open-world ancient landscape brimming with survivors and intelligent machines? Then gear up for Horizon Zero Dawn, the critically acclaimed action role-playing game that subverts the traditional post-apocalyptic narrative with its breathtaking visuals and compelling storyline. But wait, there’s more! According to industry rumors, Horizon Zero Dawn is getting a PSVR adaptation that promises to enhance the immersive experience even further.\nFans of the game were elated to hear that the immersive VR format is under development, but what makes this development extra special is that it will incorporate updated graphics and 3D audio, making gameplay more engaging than ever before. While the developers haven’t made an official announcement yet, multiple reports suggest that they are indeed working on the project behind the scenes.\nHorizon Zero Dawn is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humans and advanced machines coexist. The game features Aloy, a skilled hunter and archer who embarks on a quest to learn about her past and uncover the truth behind the mysterious machines plaguing her world. It’s a refreshing change from the usual post-apocalyptic fare, as it’s set in a world full of life, and the game is designed to offer rewards for those who explore every nook and cranny.\nThe game’s lush environments, dynamic lighting, and stunning architecture would be a breathtaking sight to behold in VR. Visuals aside, the game’s audio design, which includes a unique soundscape customized for each machine type, is equally remarkable. This means players can hear the approaching footsteps of a stalking beast or the creaking of a massive robot while they are exploring the wilds - adding to the immersive experience.\nAs with most rumors, there’s always a bit of skepticism surrounding them, especially as there hasn’t been an official announcement from the developers. Perhaps the biggest concern that fans have is whether the game will get a full-fledged PSVR upgrade (requiring new hardware) or just a smaller-scale experience (using existing hardware).\nPutting the hardware concerns aside for a moment, the idea of delving into the beautiful world of the Horizon Zero Dawn in VR is enough to make any gamer froth with excitement. With 3D audio and enhanced graphics rumored to be included in the VR adaptation, it could be an unforgettable gaming experience that blurs the line between immersion and reality.\nAs Horizon Zero Dawn remains one of the most popular and innovative games of recent years, a PSVR adaptation could reinvigorate interest in the title and possibly introduce new fans to the world of Aloy and her many challenges. Whether it will be a full-fledged VR experience or just a smaller-scale one, eager fans will have to keep an eye out for developments from the game’s developers as they keep refining this proposed project. So, prepare to experience the ultimate gaming experience of Horizon Zero Dawn in PSVR, and buckle up for an escapade of a lifetime!\nThe latest job postings from British developer Firesprite talk about an ambitious VR title based on one of the most successful IPs of the console of the past ten years. A long time ago there was a rumor that SIE London Studio was working on Horizon Zero Dawn PSVR title.\nThe British development studio Firesprite recently published several job postings suggesting an action-adventure in VR. For example, the passage regarding a lead producer states that a VR action-adventure is planned, which has been “adapted from one of the most original and successful multimillion-selling console IP titles in the last 10 years.”\nAccording to the studio, this is an extremely exciting project in which they are collaborating with those responsible for the brand to create a completely new chapter in an established universe. In doing so, the immersive possibilities of virtual reality should be exploited to the full. The team wants to tell a new story for both die-hard fans and newcomers.\nAlthough there is no clear reference to the “Horizon” franchise here, there was an interesting rumor about this as early as October 2019. At that time, a leaker reportedly found out that Sony Interactive Entertainment’s London studio was working on a PSVR title to take place in the universe of Horizon Zero Dawn.\nIn the meantime, however, this development studio has nothing to do with virtual reality games, which is why this project has probably been handed over to another developer.\nIn addition, Guerrilla Games took the official website of the first-person shooter Killzone offline. This could be an indication that the Dutch video game developer wants to concentrate fully on the Horizon series from now on.\nWe will find out at a later date whether this is really a spin-off from Horizon. In any case, this year you can look forward to the highly touted sequel to the post-apocalyptic action-RPG series, which will be released for PS5 and PS4.\n","wordCount":"828","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Janet Hall"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/horizon-zero-dawn-psvr-could-be-in-development-rumor-1929059/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Get Ready for the Ultimate Gaming Experience: Horizon Zero Dawn Psvr in the Works - Rumor Alert!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 18, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;828 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Janet Hall</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=get-ready-for-the-ultimate-gaming-experience-horizon-zero-dawn-psvr-in-the-works---rumor-alert>Get Ready for the Ultimate Gaming Experience: Horizon Zero Dawn PSVR in the Works - Rumor Alert!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#get-ready-for-the-ultimate-gaming-experience-horizon-zero-dawn-psvr-in-the-works---rumor-alert>#</a></h1><p>Are you ready to embark on a thrilling journey across an open-world ancient landscape brimming with survivors and intelligent machines?
