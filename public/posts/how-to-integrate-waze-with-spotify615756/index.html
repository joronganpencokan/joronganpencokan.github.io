However, long hours on the road can be tiring and boring, especially if you’re stuck in traffic or navigating unfamiliar roads. Fortunately, technology has offered us some incredible tools to make our road trips more fun, safe, and enjoyable.\nTwo of the most popular apps for road trippers are Waze and Spotify. Waze is a navigation app that provides real-time traffic updates, alerts, and alternative routes to help you reach your destination faster. On the other hand, Spotify is a music streaming app that offers millions of songs, playlists, and podcasts to entertain you during your trip. But did you know that you can integrate Waze with Spotify to create a seamless experience that will take your road trips to the next level?\nHere’s how to do it:\nDownload both apps and make sure you have the latest versions.\nOpen Waze and tap on the music icon on the top right corner of the screen.\nSelect Spotify as your music provider and log in to your Spotify account.\nChoose a playlist or song from Spotify that you want to play on your trip.\nStart your journey on Waze, and the music you selected will automatically play in the background. You can control the volume and skip songs directly from Waze.\nThe benefit of integrating Waze with Spotify is obvious - you don’t have to switch back and forth between the apps, which can be distracting and time-consuming. Instead, you can rely on Waze for navigation and traffic updates while enjoying your favorite music on Spotify. This is especially helpful when you’re driving alone or with someone who doesn’t want to be bothered with music selection.\nFurthermore, Waze and Spotify have teamed up to offer some exclusive features that will make your road trip even better. For instance, Waze will display your next turn or exit as an album cover, which adds a visual element to your navigation instructions. You can also access your Spotify playlists and songs from Waze without having to go back to the main Spotify app.\nIn conclusion, if you’re planning a road trip soon, don’t forget to integrate Waze with Spotify. This simple hack will revolutionize your traveling experience and make it more enjoyable, fun, and safe. Try it out and let us know how it works for you!\nWhat’s more relaxing than an open road coupled with your favorite playlist? But this can be quite tricky if you are trying to follow your navigation app at the same time. So do you leave your music app open to make it easy for you to skip and rewind the song? Or, forget about the music app and focus on the navigation app? Fortunately, this won’t be a problem anymore as Spotify and Waze have partnered up. Here’s how to integrate Waze with Spotify.\nIntegrate Waze with Spotify For this guide to work for you, you need to have both Waze and Spotify installed on your device. Also, you need to be logged in on both apps.\nYou can start off by launching the Spotify app and tapping on the “Your Library” icon. It is located on the bottom right corner. Now, tap on the Settings gear icon located on the top right corner of the screen. Scroll down till you find the Social section and tap on “Waze navigation” toggle to enable it.\nAfter you enable “Waze navigation”, a blue banner will appear on the top of Spotify asking you to go to Waze app. Waze will prompt you to connect Waze to your Spotify account. Next, tap on Okay and you will see Spotify floating icon on the Waze map. Tapping on it will show you the music controls and the name of the song that’s currently playing. If you tap on “Go to Spotify”, you will notice that the blue banner will display the next navigation step, provided that you have already entered a destination. If not, the banner will show “Go to Waze” where you have to provide it will a destination before continuing.\nNow that you’ve integrated Waze and Spotify together, launching Waze will present you with the Spotify icon and if Waze is running in the background, launching Spotify will detect it and automatically bring up banners to show directions.\n[quote bcolor=”#3ea3c1″ arrow=”yes”]\nAlso Read:\nHow to block tweets containing certain words?
