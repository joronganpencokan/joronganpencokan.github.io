From healthcare to finance, media to e-commerce, AI is transforming the way businesses and organizations operate. However, the latest development in AI is taking things to a different level. It can track and exploit your emotions.\nMain Body:\nIn recent years, researchers and experts have been exploring AI’s potential in the field of emotions. They have developed AI-powered algorithms and tools that can detect and analyze a person’s emotions and sentiments by analyzing facial expressions, voice tones, and other behavioral patterns. This development has undoubtedly opened up new avenues for emotion-based marketing and customer experience management, but it also raises concerns over privacy and ethics.\nOne of the most significant risks of this technology is its potential to manipulate and exploit people’s emotions. We have already seen how social media platforms and online retailers have used targeted ads and recommendations based on users’ search and browsing history. AI-powered emotion-detection technology can take things to a whole new level.\nFor instance, imagine a scenario where an e-commerce website tracks your emotions and sentiments while browsing their products. If they detect that you are feeling sad or unhappy, they can promote products that are associated with happiness or comfort. On the other hand, if they detect that you are feeling anxious or stressed, they can promote relaxation and stress-relief products. This kind of emotion-based marketing may seem innocuous, but it can have serious implications for people’s emotional wellbeing and decision-making.\nMoreover, the technology can also exploit people’s fears and insecurities by promoting products and services that exploit their vulnerability. For example, if the algorithm detects that a user is struggling with body-image issues, it can promote weight-loss products, diet pills, and cosmetic surgery services. This kind of emotional manipulation raises serious ethical and social implications that require further analysis and regulation.\nConclusion:\nAs AI continues to advance, so does its ability to detect and analyze people’s emotions. While this technology offers exciting opportunities for businesses and marketers, it also poses serious risks for individuals’ privacy, emotional wellbeing, and decision-making. Therefore, regulators, policymakers, and industry leaders need to take proactive steps to ensure that AI is used ethically and responsibly and that people’s rights are protected.\nArtificial intelligence can now gauge human emotions, and it’s being used in everything from education to marketing, experts say. Key Takeaways\nArtificial intelligence systems are increasingly monitoring human emotions.Your emotions could potentially be tracked using your Wi-Fi router, according to a new study from London’s Queen Mary University.Over 60% of US companies use AI in their marketing, one expert said. Your emotions could potentially be tracked using your Wi-Fi router and analyzed by AI, according to a new study from London’s Queen Mary University. Researchers used radio waves like those used in Wi-Fi to measure heart and breathing rate signals, which could determine how a person is feeling. The study shows just how pervasive emotion-monitoring could become.\n“In education, AI could be used in adapting content to serve the needs of each child best,” Kamilė Jokubaitė, CEO and founder of Attention Insight, who was not involved in the study, said in an email interview. “For example, when the child shows frustration because a task is too difficult, the program adjusts the task to become less challenging.”\nWi-Fi Reveals All For the recent study, participants were asked to watch a video selected by researchers for its ability to evoke one of four basic emotion types: anger, sadness, joy, and pleasure. While the individual was watching the video, the researchers emitted radio signals, like those transmitted from any Wi-Fi system, towards the person and measured the signals that bounced off them.\nThe researchers were able to reveal information about an individual’s heart and breathing rates by analyzing changes to these signals caused by slight body movements. The signals were then analyzed using AI.\n“Being able to detect emotions using wireless systems is a topic of increasing interest for researchers, as it offers an alternative to bulky sensors and could be directly applicable in future ‘smart’ home and building environments,” said Noor Khan, one of the paper’s authors, in a news release. “In this study, we’ve built on existing work using radio waves to detect emotions and show that the use of deep learning techniques can improve the accuracy of our results.”\nIt’s impossible to gauge emotion through text, but it is possible to measure sentiment based on data such as past behavior and content.\nTraditionally, emotion detection has relied on the assessment of visible signals such as facial expressions, speech, body gestures, or eye movements, the study’s authors said in their paper. But these methods can be unreliable, as they don’t always capture an individual’s internal emotions. Researchers are increasingly looking towards “invisible” signals, such as ECG, to understand emotions. Using a combination of AI and radio signal could be even more effective, the researchers said.\nCompanies Are Using AI to Monitor Your Feelings Observers say AI is already predicting human behavior. Over 60% of US companies use AI in their marketing, Matt Bertram, CEO of EWR Digital, said in an email interview. “With the assistance of AI, marketers are relying less on assumptions and more on data-driven insights to predict customer behavior both in the present and in the future,” he added. AI is helping companies predict customer intent and provide personalized marketing with customized product recommendations, Bertram said. “Going a step further,” he said, “customer sentiment data harvested from social media can identify patterns to allow customer behavior to be predicted months in advance.” Facial emotion recognition systems powered by AI are used in the automotive industry to assess drivers emotions and provide needed assistance, Jokubaitė said. Being able to detect emotions using wireless systems is a topic of increasing interest for researchers.\nPredicting human attention is already possible with predictive eye-tracking. AI-powered eye-tracking analytics that lets developers assess design element visibility during a website or advertisement development process, Jokubaitė added. “Thus, brands can easily get deeper insights into their audience viewing patterns and easily test and optimize different creative concepts for maximum engagement.”\nAI is likely to be watching our emotions even more in the future, experts say. “As we enter into an increasingly predictive economy, AI is creating a new form of listening, anticipating, predicting, and reacting,” Aaron Kwittken, founder and CEO of PRophet, an AI software firm, said in an email interview. “It’s impossible to gauge emotion through text, but it is possible to measure sentiment based on data such as past behavior and content.”\nBut, Kwittken cautioned, while AI-emotion reading technology could be useful, he added that “it is not a replacement for human instinct and judgment.”\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1138","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jack Barrett"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-ai-could-track-and-use-your-emotions975034/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You Won't Believe How Advanced AI Can Now Track and Exploit Your Emotions!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 18, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1138 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jack Barrett</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#heading></a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#wi-fi-reveals-all>Wi-Fi Reveals All</a></li><li><a href=#companies-are-using-ai-to-monitor-your-feelings>Companies Are Using AI to Monitor Your Feelings</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Title: You Won&rsquo;t Believe How Advanced AI Can Now Track and Exploit Your Emotions!</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undoubtedly revolutionizing numerous industries around the world.
