Are you tired of struggling to manage all your files on your iPhone or iPad? Do you find it difficult to organize and find your documents, images, and videos in one central location? If so, then the revolutionary Files app is exactly what you need!\nIn this article, we will explore how to use the Files app to unlock the ultimate file management hack for IOS.\nWhat Is The Files App?\nThe Files app is a powerful file manager that is built into the IOS operating system. It allows you to browse, search, organize, and share all your files with ease. You can access files stored on your device, in iCloud Drive, and on other cloud storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox. With Files, you can manage files across multiple locations without having to switch between different apps.\nHow To Get Started With The Files App\nTo get started with the Files app, you need to first make sure that it is installed on your IOS device. If it isn’t, you can download it for free from the App Store.\nOnce you have the Files app installed, you can start using it to manage your files. To open the app, tap on the Files icon on your home screen. You will then see a list of locations where your files are stored, including your device’s internal storage, iCloud Drive, and any cloud storage services you have connected.\nOrganizing Your Files\nOne of the main benefits of using the Files app is that it makes it easy to organize your files. To create a new folder, simply tap the “New Folder” button in the Files app and give it a name. You can then move files into the folder by selecting them and then dragging and dropping them into the folder.\nYou can also use the search function in the Files app to quickly find files that you need. Simply type in a keyword or file name, and the app will show you all the files that match your search.\nAccessing Your Files Anywhere\nOne of the most powerful features of the Files app is its ability to access your files from anywhere. Because the app integrates with cloud storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, you can access your files from any device that is connected to the internet.\nThis also means that you can share files with others easily. To share a file, simply select it in the Files app and then tap on the share icon. You can then choose to share the file via email, text message, or a variety of other methods.\nConclusion\nIf you want to unlock the ultimate file management hack for IOS, then the Files app is definitely the way to go. It allows you to easily organize, find, and share all your files from one central location. Try it out today and see how it can simplify your life!\nOne of the most underrated apps on iOS (and iPadOS) is none other than the Files app. At first, it might look like a very simple file manager which doesn’t let you dive deep into system files on your iPhone or iPad. However, we guarantee that you’ll be surprised by what this app can do, especially when it comes to mobile productivity. Using the Files app, you can access both local and cloud files, import files from external drives, organize your files, view all kinds of file types, perform an in-depth inspection, and more. With that said, it’s time to talk about how to manage your files in iOS using the Files app.\n1. Add New File Locations \u0026 Connect New Cloud Services The Files app automatically includes the files you have saved to your device (locally) as well as to your iCloud Drive. The advantage the app gives you is that you can also access the content you have in other cloud services as well.\nIf you look at the Browse sidebar (on the left side), you’ll see a group of “Locations.” Your iCloud Drive will be there as well as the files you have on your iPad and your recently deleted files. However, if you click on the button depicting three small dots in the upper-right corner and choose “Edit” or “Edit Sidebar,” you’ll get to add new locations (cloud services).\nMore precisely, you’ll see a toggle button next to each third-party cloud storage app that you have on your device, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc. Once you are happy with your selection of services, tap on the option that says “Done.”\n2. Move, Copy, Delete a File \u0026 More By long-pressing on a file, you can do various things. You can either rename, duplicate, copy, delete, move, share, tag, or get more info on a file. Also, you will see a drop-down menu that’s specific to individual file types. Therefore, if you long-press on an image, you can rotate it left or right, create a PDF, and similar.\nIf you choose “Tags,” you’ll be able to select a tag to label a file. You will then see a list of tags in the sidebar of the Files app, allowing you to easily organize files and get to specific tags in no time. If you long-press on a folder, you’ll get a list of different options. Among those is an option labeled “Favorite.” You can choose that option, and the entire folder will then appear under “Favorites” in the sidebar. And just like with files, you can also copy, duplicate, move, and delete folders.\n3. Manage, Duplicate, Share \u0026 Delete Files Without Drag and Drop At any moment, you can manage files in the Files app using drag and drop. For example, if you want to move a file, you can drag it to a different folder. However, another way to manage files is similar to how you would do it on a computer. First, open a folder containing any number of files, then tap on “Select” in the top-right corner. Next, select files and take a look at the bottom of your screen. You will see a menu bar that lets you share, duplicate, move, and delete files – in a batch. And if you tap on “More,” you can even compress files into a single ZIP archive. 4. Find a Specific File/Folder by Searching At any moment, you can search for a specific file or folder. Just tap on the “Search” field at the top of your screen, then go with a phrase for the file you want. For example, you can search for “Images,” and the Files app can further assist by allowing you to look up JPEG or PNG images. You can also narrow your search by choosing “Recents” or “iCloud Drive” (just below the search field at the top of your screen). Using those tabs, the Files app can navigate to specific files or folders more quickly. 5. Create a New Folder \u0026 Add Existing Documents/Files Creating a new folder in the Files app, then adding files, is quite easy. Long-press on a blank space in the Files app where you want the folder to appear, and tap on “New Folder.” Alternatively, you can press the “New Folder” button in the top-right corner of your iPad’s screen. If you use an iPhone, tap on “More” and then select “New Folder.”\nTo add files to your new folder, you can first select any number of files, then tap on “Move” at the bottom of your screen. A pop-up will appear so that you can navigate to your newly created folder. Easy, right?\n6. Recover Deleted Files via the Files App As soon as you open the Files app, you will see a list of locations within the app’s sidebar. This is also where you’ll find an item named “Recently Deleted.” As you can already guess, this is the location of the files you’ve deleted, waiting to be either recovered or permanently erased.\nIf you would like to recover a deleted file, long-press on it and select “Recover.” And if you want to free up some space on your device, tap on “Delete Now.” At any moment, you can also choose “Info” to get additional information about a folder or file.\nConclusion You’ll use the Files app in more situations than just within the actual app. When you’re in another app and click to add a file, it will direct you back to the Files app. You’ll very soon begin to wonder how you got along without the Files app on your iPhone or iPad. In the end, we’d like to recommend a couple of useful resources as well. You’ll want to know how to check what’s taking up your iCloud storage space, useful for diving into your files. And speaking of organizing things, here’s how to organize your iPhone apps.\nIsaac is a freelance writer with over a decade of experience covering the latest technological innovations.
