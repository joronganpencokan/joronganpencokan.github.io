Use it wisely and ethically, and enjoy the freedom to copy content that you need.\nCopy Text From a Protected Web Page: Copying others’ work is not ethically right, we understand this. However, curating content and giving proper citations to the source of the content is legal and the ethically right way. As a blogger or content writer, we all curated content from multiple websites, but we do not steal it, rather we give credit to those websites if we post their content. However, not all people are the same, so their purposes of copying content are different. There are people who simply copy and paste others’ hard work without giving proper citations and credits. This is not acceptable. Therefore, to spot the plagiarism in internet content, most of the website owners have started putting a Javascript code to prevent copying of content from their websites.\nThey simply put a code that disables the “Right-click” and “Copy” options on their website. Usually, we all are accustomed to select content by right-clicking and selecting copy. Once this feature gets disabled on the websites, we are left with one choice \u0026 that is to leave the website and find another source to copy that particular content. The Internet is a source of getting relevant information about any topic. In the race of protecting the content on the website, website administrators are activating the content protection features.\nThe Javascript code disables both the right-click and text selection and some of these websites also show a notice when you right-click which says something like this “Right-Click on this site is disabled“. How to deal with it? Have you ever experienced this problem? Let’s find out some ways to crack the problem and get answers about how to copy from right click disabled websites in Chrome.\nEffective Ways to Copy from Right Click Disabled Websites If you are using the Chrome browser, you have some options that can help to copy content from the copy-protected website.
