Shocking Truth Revealed About High-Tech Border Controls!\nAs technology continues to advance, high-tech border controls have become a norm in many countries. These controls have been established for security purposes, but many people are now questioning whether they are compromising their privacy. In this article, we will explore this topic and reveal the shocking truth about high-tech border controls.\nFirstly, what are high-tech border controls?\nHigh-tech border controls refer to the use of advanced technologies to monitor and manage borders. These technologies include facial recognition systems, fingerprint scanners, and biometric passports. They are meant to identify individuals who are entering and leaving a particular country, ensure that travelers are not carrying any illegal items, and track the movement of people.\nSo, how are high-tech border controls compromising our privacy?\nOne of the biggest concerns people have with high-tech border controls is the collection and sharing of personal data. When you pass through these controls, your personal information, such as your biometric data, travel history, and even your social media activity, can be collected and stored in databases.\nThere have been cases where this personal data has been shared with third-party companies, which raises concerns about how this information is being used or if it could be used for targeted advertising or profiling.\nMoreover, there are concerns about the accuracy of these systems. Facial recognition systems, for instance, have been found to have a high rate of false positives, which means that innocent travelers could be wrongly identified or flagged as potential security risks.\nAnother issue is the lack of transparency surrounding the use of high-tech border controls. Many countries have implemented these technologies without clear guidelines on how they are being used, what kind of data is being collected, and who has access to it.\nThe underlying problem is that high-tech border controls have been implemented without proper regulation, putting people’s privacy at risk.\nSo, what can we do about it?\nAs travelers, it is important that we are aware of our rights and what information is being collected when we pass through high-tech border controls. It is also important to ask questions and demand transparency from authorities.\nAdditionally, civil society organizations and regulators must work together to establish clear regulations on the use of high-tech border controls. These regulations should outline the types of data that can be collected, how it can be used, and who has access to it.\nIn conclusion, high-tech border controls have raised serious concerns about the privacy of travelers. While these technologies have been implemented to ensure security, the lack of transparency and regulation have compromised people’s privacy. As we continue to advance technologically, it is crucial that we ensure our privacy is protected and respected.\nErik Learned-Miller was flying last year from Hartford, Connecticut to a conference in Seoul, South Korea when he noticed cameras scanning his face at the airport. A US government agency was using facial recognition to identify him, he said. Key Takeaways\nCustoms and Border Protection plan to use facial recognition to identify every traveler entering the country by 2025. The Department of Homeland Security can now extract a phone’s location history, social media information, photos, and videos.The software is still not accurate enough to prevent false matches.How data collected at borders are shared between government agencies is important for protecting privacy. “I had a little bit of trepidation,” said Learned-Miller, a University of Massachusetts Amherst computer science professor who studies facial recognition technology, in a phone interview. “It’s worrisome that my face could end up in a database used by another government agency.”\nLearned-Miller is among the increasing number of travelers who are being subjected to high-tech identification and data searches at US borders. Some civil liberties experts say the use of such technologies threatens privacy. Earlier this year, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced that every pedestrian traveler entering the country from Mexico will soon be identified using biometric facial comparison technology at the Brownsville Port of Entry. Previously, CBP officials said the agency will use facial recognition to identify every traveler entering the country by 2025. In July, the Department of Homeland Security detailed the tools it can now use to extract a phone’s data, including its location history, social media information, photos, and videos.\nFace the Facts Facial recognition uses cameras and computers to compare pictures of travelers to passport and ID photos in government records, according to CBP. The agency has used the technology “to interdict more than 250 imposters who attempted to cross the Southwest Border using another person’s travel document” since Sept. 2018, according to a news release.\nThe technology is also used to screen travelers entering the US at airports.\nOne problem with facial recognition technology is that it’s still not accurate enough to prevent false matches. For example, current facial recognition systems often misidentify people of color, Learned-Miller said. He pointed to the recent case of Robert Williams, a Black man living in a suburb of Detroit, Michigan, who was misidentified by the software and arrested for a crime he did not commit.\nPrivacy lawyer Susan Hintze also called into question the accuracy of facial recognition technology and called it “very nascent in terms of its ability” to accurately detect people.\n”These systems are more prone to misidentify people of color rather than White people,” she added via phone interview. “The major issue here is that a lot of people at the border are people of color so the chances of being misidentified are fairly high. It’s inappropriate to be using this technology until it has improved.” CBP says the facial recognition systems it uses are designed to protect privacy. In its news release, the agency explains it has “employed strong technical security safeguards and has limited the amount of personally identifiable information used in the new biometric process. “New photos of US citizens will be deleted within 12 hours. Photos of foreign nationals will be stored in a secure DHS system.” US citizens traveling across the border can opt out of the facial recognition by requesting a manual document check, according to the agency. Your Phone Isn’t Safe Border patrol agents are also searching phones and computers, according to a recent report. Agents can copy digital devices—including cell phones and tablets—when travelers cross the border and collect data including contacts, call logs, emails, and social media information. DHS and border agents were allowed to search devices without a warrant until a court ruled against the practice last year. Now, most searches of electronic devices are collected with warrants, the report said.\nBut the document also outlined broad categories in which travelers’ devices can be searched without warrants, including when consent is given by the traveler, devices that are “lost,” and “if there is an imminent threat to the safety of the public or law enforcement, such as a life or death situation.”\nBrenda Leong, Senior Counsel and Director of Artificial Intelligence and Ethics at Future of Privacy Forum said that collecting cell phone data at the border raises privacy concerns. “The amount of data available via cellphone and related apps and cloud storage and tracking data from providers and so on is unbelievably extensive, so obviously [it] creates significant privacy concerns,” Leong explained on the phone.\nHow the data collected at borders are shared between government agencies is key to protecting privacy. “In general, to share data across agencies takes permission, you can’t just hand over data,” said Leong. “CBP can’t just hand over data to the IRS or anybody in the government. We have to look at whether requests for information sharing are being made inappropriately.” Safeguards need to be put in place to make sure the data collected is not misused, observers say. Data collected on travelers should be kept for a limited amount of time and only used for the stated purpose, suggested Learned-Miller. “There is potential for abuse of the system so if people are taking your picture for an authorized purpose, but then use it for any unauthorized purpose, that’s a serious concern.”\nLearned-Miller called for an independent federal agency to regulate the use of facial recognition technology, saying “there needs to be auditing and disclosure to make sure rules are being followed.”\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1382","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Thomas Freeman"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/high-tech-border-controls-could-threaten-privacy1192033/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Is Your Privacy at Risk?
