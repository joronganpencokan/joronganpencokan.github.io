Have you been feeling unimpressed with your current phone’s functionality? Are you ready for an exciting tech revolution? Look no further than the Android N Beta!\nBy installing Android N Beta, you can experience the latest version of Android and access its new features before they are officially released. But don’t worry, installing the beta version is easy and straightforward. Here are the simple steps to follow to get started:\nStep 1: Backup Your Data Before taking any steps, make sure to backup your phone’s data to avoid losing any important files or information. You can do this by connecting your phone to your computer and transferring the files or by using a cloud service.\nStep 2: Download the Android N Beta To download the Android N Beta, head over to the Android Beta Program website and enroll your device. Once enrolled, you will receive an OTA (Over-The-Air) update in your device’s settings.\nNote that the Android N Beta is only available for select devices, including the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 9, Pixel C, and General Mobile 4G.\nStep 3: Install the Android N Beta After downloading the OTA update, your device will begin to install the Android N Beta. This process may take some time, but it’s essential to let the installation run without interruptions to prevent any issues.\nStep 4: Enjoy the New Features Once your phone completes the installation, you will notice that there are plenty of new features to explore. Android N Beta comes equipped with multi-window support, improved notifications, and a redesigned interface, to name a few.\nThe integration of Google Assistant is also a massive selling point. The virtual assistant, which was initially available exclusively on Google Pixel, is now widely available in Android N Beta. The assistant allows you to send messages, set reminders, and Google search all without touching your phone.\nConclusion In conclusion, by following these simple steps, you can revolutionize your phone experience by installing the Android N Beta. With the latest version of Android and its many new features, you can unlock your phone’s full potential and stay ahead of the tech curve. So, what are you waiting for? Try it out!\nGoogle is gearing up to release Android N later this summer for phones and tablets with a lot of improvements and features, including Google Assistant, Instant Apps, reply in notifications and group notifications, multi-window, night mode, new battery saving improvements with the Doze feature, and a lot more.\nIt’ll be an exciting release for many Android fans, but if you don’t want to wait, similar to Microsoft’s Windows Insider Program to test new early versions of the operating system, Google has its Android Beta program that is open to the public.\nThe beta program allows you the opportunity to try the pre-release versions of Android N on certain devices that you may opt into the program. Once the device is enrolled, it’ll receive the latest version of Android N on an over-the-air (OTA) update.\nIn this guide, you’ll get everything you need to know to install Android N beta to test all the new features and changes, and you’ll also see the instructions to leave the program and roll back to the stable public release of the Google’s mobile operating system.\nHow to enroll and install Android N beta When you’re ready to try Google’s upcoming Android N, follow these steps:\nVisit the Android Beta Program page. Sign-in with your Google Account that you’re currently using on your eligible phone or tablet. Scroll down and you’ll find a list with all the devices compatible with Android N beta, just click the Enroll device button. Now that your Google device is enrolled on the Android Beta Program, you’ll need to wait up to 24 hours for the update to arrive into your device. If you don’t see the update you can go to Settings \u003e About \u003e System updates and check for updates.\nVisit the Android Beta Program page. Sign-in with your Google Account that you’re currently using on your eligible phone or tablet.\nScroll down and you’ll find a list with all the devices compatible with Android N beta, just click the Enroll device button.\nConsider that any device hidden on Google Play won’t appear listed to enroll in the beta program. To fix this issue, check your Google Play settings. Alternatively, you can manually install Android N on your device by downloading the image from developer.android.com, but following this route will block you from getting over-the-air updates automatically, unless, of course, you enroll your device in the Android Beta Program.\nAccording to Google, during the beta program, you’ll receive a new preview every 4 to 6 weeks. Then after Android N releases to the public, you’ll have to make the decision to continue receiving future previews, which Google call “maintenance releases (MRs)”, or you may opt-out of the program and return to the stable release everyone is using.\nDevices eligible for Android N beta Only the following devices are compatible to run the beta version of Android N:\nNexus 6 Nexus 9 Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel C General Mobile 4G (Android One) If you own a Sony Xperia Z3, you can try Google’s new mobile operating system through the Sony’s N Developer Preview program. How to check if you’re running Android N beta You can use the following steps to check the version of Android you’re running:\nOn your device, navigate through Settings \u003e About \u003e Build number. If you see the build number starting with NP, then Android N has been successfully installed. Or reboot your Google device, and then you’ll see a message telling you are running the beta version of Android.\nHow to leave the beta program and uninstall Android N If you decide that you’re not ready for Android N, you can leave the beta program at any time. However, remember to backup any data and settings that are not already automatically backed up, as the roll back to the public release of Android will erase everything on your device to install the latest stable release of the operating system.\nWhen you’re ready to stop using the beta version of Android N, follow these steps:\nVisit the Android Beta Program page. Sign-in with your Google Account that you’re currently using on your eligible phone or tablet. Scroll down and you’ll find a list with all the devices compatible with Android N beta, just click the Unenroll device button. Soon after you press the Unenroll device button and an update will arrive to your device to wipe out the beta version and data, and it’ll install the latest stable version of Android.\nScroll down and you’ll find a list with all the devices compatible with Android N beta, just click the Unenroll device button.\nShould you install the beta version of Android N? While Google feels that Android N is polished and stable enough to run as your primary operating system on your phone and tablet, remember that it’s a beta version, which means that it is not a finished product. The pre-release version of the operating system contains bugs, incomplete features, and many things will not work correctly affecting the functionality of your phone or tablet.\nGoogle has published several known issues for Android N that users should be aware of before jumping into the beta program.\nAlthough with each new release, the company will continue to improve the operating system, currently there are some known issues with the Camera app, audio performance, Wi-Fi connectivity drops, and media playback. This is in addition to the problems when using multi-window mode, Google Play services, external storage, and more.\nYou can see all the known issues for Android N at the Android Developers website.\nWill you be installing Android N beta on your phone?
