Minecraft, the virtual world where anything is possible, is all about exploration and creativity, and for players who are always on the go, traveling from one place to another can be time-consuming and tiring. Fortunately, Minecraft has a solution: The Soul Sand Water Elevator!\nWith the Soul Sand Water Elevator, players can travel to higher or lower levels of a building or structure without having to climb staircases or ladders. This elevator is highly efficient, user-friendly, and easy to build. To help you unlock the secret to effortlessly traveling up and down in Minecraft, we’re providing a step-by-step guide on how to make your own Soul Sand Water Elevator.\nItems you need 12 Slime blocks 1 Soul Sand block 1 Bucket of Water 2 Hoppers 1 Chest 1 Button Building blocks (stone, cobblestone, etc.) Building the elevator First, select a location where you want to build your elevator. A good location is near the entrance of your building or structure, where it’s easily accessible.\nPlace the Soul Sand block at the bottom of the elevator shaft.\nBuild a column of blocks around the Soul Sand block three blocks high.\nOn the top block, add a hopper and a chest to trap any items that may fall in the elevator.\nFollow it up by placing a row of slime blocks on top of the three-block-tall column that you have created.\nUse your bucket of water to fill the elevator shaft from the top until it reaches the bottom.\nPlace a button on one of the top slime blocks.\nCongratulations, your Soul Sand Water Elevator is now complete!\nHow it works When you step onto the elevator, the Soul Sand block at the bottom slows down the water, and you’ll start to rise. Once you reach the top, you’ll step onto a slime block, which will launch you forward, and you’ll be able to jump onto the next slime block with ease. Thanks to the slime blocks, you won’t take any damage when you land.\nBenefits of a Soul Sand Water Elevator One of the best benefits of the Soul Sand Water Elevator is that it’s faster than using traditional staircases or ladders. It also cuts down on the time needed to climb and descend which means more time for other activities in Minecraft.

With this step-by-step guide, you can enjoy the ultimate gaming experience in Minecraft by unlocking the secret to effortlessly traveling up and down anytime you want!\nIt is evident that you will have to reach different stories of huge buildings in Minecraft. Since moving up and down frequently on huge buildings can become hectic, we are here with a guide on how to make a Water Elevator using Soul Sand in Minecraft. This elevator will let you quickly move through various large structures in no time.\nHow to Make Water Elevator using Soul Sand in Minecraft To make a Water Elevator using Soul Sand in Minecraft, you will require a few items which are:\nIron bucket: You can craft an iron bucket with three iron bars. It is needed to fill the water required to build the Water Elevator. Blocks: Required to build the sidewalls of the elevator so that you don’t fall off. You can choose any blocks. Soul Sand block: Found in the Nether region, it is required to help you move upwards in the elevator. Magma block: Found in the Nether region, it is required to help you move downwards in the elevator. Two signs: Required to put on the sides of the Soul and Magma blocks so that the water does not flow outside the elevator track. Once you have all the required ingredients, follow the below step-by-step guide to building a Water Elevator using Soul Sand block in Minecraft.\nUse your building blocks to create a column. (Surround a single block sideways and backwards with only a single space going upward) Dig the center of your column up to one block down and place the Soul Sand block within. Create a walkway on the Soul Sand and place the two signs. Stand on top of the elevator and place the water on the soul sand. If the water starts moving upwards along with bubbles, you have created the Water Elevator successfully. Step inside the stream and it will take you to the top of the building, until where you have created the elevator. You will also have to ensure that every space in the elevator is equipped with a water source for the elevator to function appropriately. But that’s not the end, if you are going up, you also need a column to come down. Hence, create another column beside this one for coming down. Simply follow the same process, the only change is that you have to use the Magma block this time, instead of the Soul Sand. However, while coming down the elevator using the Magma block, you will get minor damage, which you can easily recover after reaching the ground.\nThat’s everything you need to know about how to make a Water Elevator using Soul Sand in Minecraft. Minecraft is a vast game, ensure reading our guides on how to change the weather, craft Charcoal, and make Potion of Weakness in Minecraft.\n","wordCount":"931","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-30T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sharon Myers"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-make-soul-sand-water-elevator-in-minecraft-1040436/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock the Secret to Effortlessly Traveling Up and Down in Minecraft with This Genius Soul Sand Water Elevator!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 30, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;931 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Sharon Myers</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#unlock-the-secret-to-effortlessly-traveling-up-and-down-in-minecraft-with-this-genius-soul-sand-water-elevator>Unlock the Secret to Effortlessly Traveling Up and Down in Minecraft with This Genius Soul Sand Water Elevator!</a><ul><li><a href=#items-you-need>Items you need</a></li><li><a href=#building-the-elevator>Building the elevator</a></li><li><a href=#how-it-works>How it works</a></li><li><a href=#benefits-of-a-soul-sand-water-elevator>Benefits of a Soul Sand Water Elevator</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#how-to-make-water-elevator-using-soul-sand-in-minecraft>How to Make Water Elevator using Soul Sand in Minecraft</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h2 id=unlock-the-secret-to-effortlessly-traveling-up-and-down-in-minecraft-with-this-genius-soul-sand-water-elevator>Unlock the Secret to Effortlessly Traveling Up and Down in Minecraft with This Genius Soul Sand Water Elevator!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#unlock-the-secret-to-effortlessly-traveling-up-and-down-in-minecraft-with-this-genius-soul-sand-water-elevator>#</a></h2><p>Minecraft, the virtual world where anything is possible, is all about exploration and creativity, and for players who are always on the go, traveling from one place to another can be time-consuming and tiring.
