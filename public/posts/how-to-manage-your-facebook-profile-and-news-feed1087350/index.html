Learn How to Manage Your News Feed Like a Pro! In today’s world, social media has become an integral part of our lives. It keeps us connected with our loved ones, and we get to know about the happenings around the world. And when it comes to social media, nothing is more popular than Facebook! With over 2.7 billion monthly active users, it is undoubtedly the king of social media.\nCreating a perfect Facebook profile is important, whether you’re looking to make new friends or connect with old ones. The profile tells a story about who you are, what you do, and what you care about. In this article, we’ll unlock the secrets to a perfect Facebook profile and learn how to manage our News Feed like a pro!\nStep 1: Choose an appropriate profile picture The first thing people notice on your Facebook profile is your profile picture. Make sure it’s a clear and appropriate image that represents you in the best way possible. Avoid blurry or pixelated photos, as they can be unappealing. Your profile picture should be a headshot or a full-body shot that highlights your personality.\nStep 2: Create an engaging cover photo A cover photo is like a billboard for your Facebook profile. It’s the first thing people see when they visit your page. Choose an engaging image that reflects your personality, hobbies or sports teams you follow. You can make a collage of your favorite photos or create a custom graphic design to show off your creative skills. Keep in mind that your cover photo should look professional and not be too busy.\nStep 3: Fill out your “About” section The “About” section on your Facebook profile gives the necessary information about you. It tells people who you are, where you’re from, and what you’re interested in. Make sure to fill out every detail, including your education, work experience, and relationship status, to give people a more accurate representation of yourself.\nStep 4: Customize your tabs Facebook offers customizable tabs that you can use to display your favorite photos, videos, and even include a list of your favorite websites. Customize these tabs to showcase the things you’re passionate about and provide individuals visiting your profile an idea of what you like.\nStep 5: Manage your News Feed The Facebook News Feed is the place where you can see the latest updates from your friends, pages you follow, and groups you belong to. To manage your News Feed like a pro, prioritize the content that you want to see. Use the “See First” feature on your friends’ and family’s profiles, pages or groups to ensure that you see their content first. Unfollow or “hide” posts from people or pages whose content does not interest you. Use the “Save” feature to bookmark posts and content that you want to revisit later.\nIn conclusion, managing your Facebook profile can be challenging, but creating a perfect one is easy if you follow these simple steps. Choose the right profile picture that reflects your personality, create an engaging cover photo, fill out your “About” section, customize your tabs, and manage your News Feed. By implementing these steps, you’re sure to have an impressive Facebook profile that represents you in the best possible way.\nFacebook is the undisputed social media site leader, but there’s a bit of a learning curve when you’re just getting started sharing, posting, liking, and using other Facebook features. Here’s a look at Facebook’s key elements, including your Facebook Profile page, Home page, and News Feed, and how to use them.\nFacebook Friends Facebook friends are the people you’ve connected with after you’ve accepted each other’s friend requests. It’s easy to search for friends and people you know using Facebook’s search engine, and Facebook will often suggest potential friends based on your current relationships. After you’ve added friends, they’ll show up on your Friends list.\nCreate a Post on Facebook When you open up Facebook on your home page, you’ll see a text box that says, “What’s on your mind [your name]?” It’s where you’ll type your status update or thoughts and upload photos.\nHome Page and News Feed Your Facebook Home page displays your News Feed. Your News Feed page is where you can see and scroll through anything posted by the people and business Pages you follow. The News Feed is where you arrive when you log in to Facebook. You can access it anytime by selecting the house-shaped Home icon on the top of the page if you’re using Facebook on the desktop. On the mobile app, you’ll see the Home icon on the bottom menu for iPhone or top for Android.\nProfile Page Your Profile page is where you’ll arrive after selecting your name and image from the top right on the desktop or by selecting Menu \u003e See Your Profile on the Facebook mobile app.\nYour Profile page contains your profile picture and a cover photo, biographical information you can add to or edit at any time, and a scrollable list of posts you’ve made or those in which you’ve been tagged.\nThe Profile is where you can edit your About information, view your friends and photos, and manage your posts. This page was called the “Wall” or the “Timeline” in the past.\nOther users may navigate to your Profile page to learn more about you. You have the option of making your Profile page information available to anyone on Facebook to see or to keep your Profile visible only to your Facebook friends.\nHow Your News Feed and Profile Page Differ Your News Feed and Profile page are where you’ll likely spend the most time on Facebook. The News Feed is about your friends and what they’re doing, while your Profile page is about you and the information you’re OK with sharing.\nYour News Feed page is a stream of continually updated information from your friends and any Groups or Facebook Pages you follow. What you see is unique because it centers around the people and organizations that interest you.\nNews Feed Viewing Options You have some control over how your News Feed presents posts to you. You can prioritize specific posts, snooze people who may currently be annoying you, unfollow people, and reconnect with people you’ve previously unfollowed.\nIf you’re using Facebook via a web browser on your computer, you’ll access your account settings to control News Feed viewing options.\nFrom your News Feed page or Profile page, select Account (upside-down triangle) from the top right. Select Settings \u0026 Privacy. Select News Feed Preferences. Select Manage Favorites to see posts from certain people higher in your newsfeed; select Unfollow to remove posts from your newsfeed from people or Pages you choose; select Reconnect to see posts from people you previously unfollowed; or select Snooze to take a 30-day break from seeing someone’s posts. To manage News Feed settings using the Facebook mobile app, select More (three lines), and then go to Settings \u0026 Privacy \u003e Settings \u003e News Feed Preferences. From your News Feed page or Profile page, select Account (upside-down triangle) from the top right.\nSelect Settings \u0026 Privacy.\nSelect News Feed Preferences.\nSelect Manage Favorites to see posts from certain people higher in your newsfeed; select Unfollow to remove posts from your newsfeed from people or Pages you choose; select Reconnect to see posts from people you previously unfollowed; or select Snooze to take a 30-day break from seeing someone’s posts.\nTo manage News Feed settings using the Facebook mobile app, select More (three lines), and then go to Settings \u0026 Privacy \u003e Settings \u003e News Feed Preferences.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1287","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-03T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lizbeth Dickson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-manage-your-facebook-profile-and-news-feed1087350/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock the Secrets to a Perfect Facebook Profile!
