Sony has announced that the State of Play event this week is going to feature an exclusive first look at the gameplay of the upcoming game. This announcement has left fans thrilled and eager to witness the spectacular visuals of the post-apocalyptic world, exciting combat mechanics, and the new features that await them.\nHorizon Forbidden West is a game that is set in a ruined world that was once dominated by machines. Players take the role of Aloy, a hunter who wields a bow, and uses stealth and agility to overcome her tribe’s enemies. The game is a combination of action, adventure, and RPG elements that make it an exhilarating experience.\nThe gameplay of the game promises to be even better than its predecessor. Fans can expect to see a world that is more visually stunning and detailed than before. The graphics of the game have improved, and players can experience the game in a more immersive environment. The game features a mix of new and familiar enemies that will challenge players in new ways. The game also promises new weapons, skills, and crafting systems that will provide players with more choices and customization.\nOne of the major highlights of the upcoming State of Play event is the introduction of the game’s new protagonist, Erend. Erend is a member of the Oseram tribe who assists Aloy in her quest to save the world from destruction. Fans are excited to see Erend in action, and learn more about his backstory.\nApart from the gameplay, fans are also expecting to hear more about the game’s release date. While there is no official announcement yet, fans are hoping that Sony might drop a surprise reveal during the event. Horizon Forbidden West is one of the most anticipated games of 2021, and fans cannot wait to get their hands on it.\nIn conclusion, Horizon Forbidden West promises to be a game that exceeds its predecessor in every aspect. The gameplay of the game is expected to be breathtaking, and fans are eager to witness the new features that await them. The State of Play event is the perfect opportunity for Sony to showcase what they have been working on all these years. The game has been in development for quite some time, and fans are hoping that it will live up to their expectations. The excitement around this upcoming game is palpable, and the State of Play event will undoubtedly be one of the most viewed events of the year.\nToday, Guerrilla Games confirmed a State of Play dedicated to Horizon Forbidden West, which will arrive on May 27, 2021.\nVery soon we will receive news about Horizon Forbidden West, as Guerrilla Games has confirmed a dedicated State of Play. The conference will be held on May 27th, and it seems that we will finally be able to discover new details on the production, which is still somewhat mysterious.\nWe are so excited to show you more of Horizon Forbidden West! This Thursday, May 27, join us on a very special journey into new and uncharted lands.\n?

In this 20-minute exclusive segment, you’ll be seeing about 14 minutes of brand new in-game action featuring our heroic protagonist Aloy, all captured directly on PlayStation 5.\nThis reveal has been a true team effort and we’re very excited to show you what we have in store. Whether you’ve been with us and Aloy since Horizon Zero Dawn or are only just getting to know this incredible world, we want to share this huge milestone with you and cannot wait to see your favorite moments and reactions.\nRecall that Horizon Forbidden West will release exclusively on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.\n","wordCount":"811","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Susan Miguel"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/horizon-forbidden-west-new-state-of-play-is-coming-this-week-126703/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Exclusive First Look at Horizon Forbidden West's Epic Gameplay - State of Play Drops This Week!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 4, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;811 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Susan Miguel</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>+++
