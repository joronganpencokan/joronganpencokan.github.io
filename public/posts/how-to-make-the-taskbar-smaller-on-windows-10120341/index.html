It can display at the top or either side of the screen or even on all your connected monitors.\nIn our experience, moving the taskbar can sometimes cause it to be a bit thicker than it was in its previous position. If this happens, the only way around it is to resize it, which, as you read above, is pretty easy to do.\nAnother reason to make the Windows 10 taskbar smaller or larger is if a software glitch or other issue accidentally resized it.
