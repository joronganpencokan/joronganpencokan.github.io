If you play one or more of those games, and you want to play them on your Steam Deck, then you’ll need to install Windows.\nInstalling Windows on a Steam Deck also allows you to install other digital storefronts, like Epic and Origin, and play games you own through those platforms on the handheld.

If you have any apps that don’t run on Linux, or you just aren’t comfortable with Linux, this may be an attractive option.\nWhy Can’t You Dual Boot Windows and SteamOS? You can dual boot Windows and Linux, so it might come as a surprise you can’t dual boot Windows on your Steam Deck. The truth is that it actually is possible, but the process is very difficult and requires a lot of behind-the-scenes work that just isn’t viable for the average Steam Deck owner.\nTwo big issues are that the SteamOS takes up the entire internal drive with its own partitions when it’s installed, and both the Windows installer and Windows updates can break the bootloader that’s necessary to dual boot. There are ways around these issues, but they aren’t worth the trouble for the average user. Installing Windows to a microSD card is a much easier option.\nHow do I install Discord on my Steam Deck?

If you install Windows on a USB drive or SD card, you can switch between the operating systems freely each time you boot up your Steam Deck.</p><h2 id=how-to-dual-boot-windows-and-steamos-on-steam-deck>How to Dual Boot Windows and SteamOS on Steam Deck<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-dual-boot-windows-and-steamos-on-steam-deck>#</a></h2><p>You can’t dual boot Windows and SteamOS on the built-in Steam Deck storage, but you can if you install Windows on a USB drive or a micro SD card. If you will only need Windows when your Steam Deck is stationary at home, preferably plugged into a powered dock, then you can use an external USB-C drive. If you want access to windows on the go, then an SD card is the most convenient option.</p><p>If you’re installing Windows 11, TPM needs to be enabled in the BIOS. If you have trouble, make sure your Steam Deck is fully updated, because it didn’t originally come with TPM support.</p><p>Here’s how to boot Windows from an SD card on a Steam Deck:</p><ul><li>Create a bootable Windows USB drive or micro SD card.</li><li>Connect the bootable USB drive to your Steam Deck, or insert the bootable SD card.</li><li>Jeremy Laukkonen / Lifewire</li><li>Make sure the Steam Deck is turned off.</li><li>Hold volume down and press the power button.</li><li>Jeremy Laukkonen / Lifewire</li><li>Select the USB drive or SD card.</li><li>Jeremy Laukkonen / Lifewire</li><li>The Steam Deck will boot into Windows.</li><li>Jeremy Laukkonen / Lifewire</li><li>The display will be sideways at this time.</li><li>Follow the on-screen prompts to complete Windows setup.</li><li>Jeremy Laukkonen / Lifewire</li><li>When the Windows desktop appears, navigate to Start > Settings > System > Display.</li><li>Select Display Orientation > Landscape, then accept the change when prompted.</li><li>Open Edge, and navigate to the Steam Deck Windows Resources page.</li><li>Download the APU driver, Wi-Fi driver, Bluetooth driver, SD card reader driver, and both audio drivers.</li><li>Install the drivers, and you’ll be ready to use Windows on your Steam Deck.</li><li>Your Steam Deck will boot into SteamOS each time it is turned off and back on.

If you’ve downloaded any games on your Steam Deck, made any modifications, set up any emulators, or made any other changes, that will all be lost when you replace SteamOS with Windows. You can switch back to SteamOS later using the SteamOS recovery image, but that is essentially a factory reset that will require you to set up your Steam Deck from scratch.</p><p>Create a bootable Windows USB drive or micro SD card.</p><p>Connect the bootable USB drive to your Steam Deck, or insert the bootable SD card.</p><p>Make sure the Steam Deck is turned off.</p><p>Hold volume down and press the power button.</p><p>Select the USB drive or SD card.</p><p>The Steam Deck will boot into Windows.</p><p>The display will be sideways at this time.</p><p>Follow the on-screen prompts to complete Windows setup.</p><p>When the Windows desktop appears, navigate to Start > Settings > System > Display.</p><p>Select Display Orientation > Landscape, then accept the change when prompted.</p><p>Open Edge, and navigate to the Steam Deck Windows Resources page.</p><p>Download the APU driver, Wi-Fi driver, Bluetooth driver, SD card reader driver, and both audio drivers.</p><p>Install the drivers, and you’ll be ready to use Windows on your Steam Deck.</p><p>Your Steam Deck will boot into SteamOS each time it is turned off and back on.

Heck, it’s capable of playing a lot of games that are only playable on Windows. This is thanks to Proton, which is a compatibility layer that lets you run Windows games on Linux PCs.</p><p>Create a Windows installation drive.</p><p>Turn your Steam Deck off.</p><p>Connect your installation drive to the Steam Deck via USB.</p><p>You can use an adapter if necessary.</p><p>Hold volume down and press the power button, then release both.</p><p>Select EFI USB Device.</p><p>The Steam Deck will boot up with the Windows installer active.

If you play one or more of those games, and you want to play them on your Steam Deck, then you’ll need to install Windows.</p><p>Installing Windows on a Steam Deck also allows you to install other digital storefronts, like Epic and Origin, and play games you own through those platforms on the handheld. If you have a lot of games on those platforms, then you’ll benefit from installing Windows.</p><p>Aside from games, installing Windows on a Steam Deck also turns your handheld into a portable Windows PC. You can plug it into a monitor via the HDMI cable, connect a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, and have access to Windows on the go. If you have any apps that don’t run on Linux, or you just aren’t comfortable with Linux, this may be an attractive option.</p><h2 id=why-cant-you-dual-boot-windows-and-steamos>Why Can’t You Dual Boot Windows and SteamOS?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#why-cant-you-dual-boot-windows-and-steamos>#</a></h2><p>You can dual boot Windows and Linux, so it might come as a surprise you can’t dual boot Windows on your Steam Deck. The truth is that it actually is possible, but the process is very difficult and requires a lot of behind-the-scenes work that just isn’t viable for the average Steam Deck owner.</p><p>Two big issues are that the SteamOS takes up the entire internal drive with its own partitions when it’s installed, and both the Windows installer and Windows updates can break the bootloader that’s necessary to dual boot. There are ways around these issues, but they aren’t worth the trouble for the average user. Installing Windows to a microSD card is a much easier option.</p><ul><li>How do I install Discord on my Steam Deck?</li><li>Press the Power button and select Switch To Desktop, then open the Discover Software Center.
