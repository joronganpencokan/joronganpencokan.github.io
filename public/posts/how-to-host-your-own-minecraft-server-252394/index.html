Minecraft is one of the most beloved video games of all time. The game is all about being creative, exploring new lands, and building astonishing structures. However, as much as we can enjoy playing with our friends on a public server, the real fun comes when we have our own private world. How to achieve that? The answer is simple: set up your own server!\nWith your own server, you can invite your friends to join, and have complete control over the game. Setting up a Minecraft server isn’t as difficult as it seems. All you need is a computer (or a separate server), an internet connection, and the right software. Here are the steps to get started:\nStep 1: Download the Minecraft server software. The first thing you need to do is download the official Minecraft server software from the Minecraft website. It’s completely free, and you can find it under the “Download” section. Make sure to select the correct version, as it tends to change with each update.\nStep 2: Configure the server properties. Once you have downloaded the server software, you will need to create the “server properties” file. This file controls the basic settings of your server, such as the name, difficulty level, and world type. You can do this by opening Notepad (or any other text editor) and saving the file as “server properties”. You then need to locate the server folder where you downloaded the server software, place the file in it, and configure the settings to your preferences.\nStep 3: Port Forwarding Now comes the trickiest part. You will need to configure your router to allow outside connections to your server. This process is called port forwarding. The steps may vary, depending on your router model, but you can follow these general guidelines:\n1. Log in to your router's settings (usually by typing \"192.168.1.1\" or \"192.168.0.1\" in your web browser).\r2. Navigate to the \"Port Forwarding\" or \"Virtual Server\" section.\r3. Add a new port forward rule for the Minecraft server.\r4. Enter the server's IP address (which you can find by typing \"ipconfig\" in the command prompt).\r5. Choose the TCP/UDP protocol and port numbers used by Minecraft. (Default: 25565).\r6. Save the changes and restart your router. Step 4: Launch the server. After you’ve completed the port forwarding, you can launch your server by double-clicking the server software file. If everything has been set up correctly, you should see a console window with no errors. Your server is now up and running. From there, you can invite your friends to join by giving them your router’s public IP address (which you can find on a website like whatismyip.com).\nStep 5: Customize your server. Now comes the fun part: customizing your server. You can install plugins, mods, and resource packs to add new features, blocks, and items. You can also set up mini-games, build competitions, and events to make your server unique. The possibilities are endless. With your own server, you can control everything, from the rules to the decor.\nIn conclusion, setting up your own Minecraft server is not only affordable but also easy and rewarding. It allows you to play the game the way you want, with the people you choose, and adds a whole new level of creativity and fun. So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead, and start setting up your own server today!\nMinecraft is still a very popular game, and a big part of the appeal behind it is the ability to host and run your own servers. It’s surprisingly simple to host a Minecraft server, and you can get one running quickly.\nThis guide covers one of many ways to get a Minecraft server running, but this method is one of the simplest and most stable server setups possible.\nBefore You Get Started If you’re just planning to run a Minecraft server on your local network, this isn’t a concern, but if you want people to be able to play on your server over the Internet, you’re going to need to find hosting for your server.\nThere are plenty of great options that you can use to host your Minecraft server: Linode and DigitalOcean are usually a safe bet. You will need a VPS (Virtual Private Server) to host Minecraft. You can’t host on cheap shared hosting that’s typically designed for hosting simple websites.\nYou’re also going to be hosting the server on Linux. While it is possible to run a Windows Minecraft server, Linux is cheaper to host, and it’s generally easier to maintain. Ubuntu is a solid pick when it comes to a distribution. It’s fairly beginner friendly, stable, and it has an active community to help, should you need it.\nEverything from here assumes that you have hosting and that you’ve signed in to a terminal, either through SSH or a web interface provided by your host. Any good VPS host will allow you terminal access.\nInstall the Dependencies You’re going to need a few software packages before you can run the Minecraft server. You can install them directly with Ubuntu’s Apt package manager. Begin by running the following command in the terminal on your server:\nIf you’ve never used a Linux package manager before, wait a few seconds while Ubuntu installs your new software. It’ll let you know when it’s finished.\nDownload the Minecraft Server Set up the directory where you want to run the server. This doesn’t matter too much. You can do everything out of your home directory, if that’s most convenient for you.\nOn your regular computer, drop by the Mincraft server download page. Locate the download link for the latest version of the Minecraft server. Copy that link location with your browser.\nBack in the server terminal, begin typing the line below:\nPaste in the address that you copied, which will look something like this:\nYou’re going to need to accept the Minecraft license in order to run your server. You do that by creating a file in the same directory as your server. The server will read the file and see that you’ve accepted the license.\nWrite a Startup Script You don’t need a startup script, but it’s easier to just combine things into a script so you only need to run one command to start up your server. Begin making a new file by opening it with your text editor. If you’re not familiar with Linux text editors, use Nano.\nThen, fill in your script to look like this:\nSave your script and exit the text editor. You’ll also need to make your script executable before you can run it.\nStart the Server You’re finally ready to start up your server. Give it a name that you can easily identify in quotes when you run the script.\nYour server will start up, and you’ll be able to connect by entering your server’s IP address in your Minecraft client. Remember to keep your server updated by replacing the server .jar file with new releases.\nIf you plan on making your server public, it’s worth looking into your VPS host’s tips to secure the server. It’d also be a good idea to enable a firewall. Ubuntu has an excellent option in the form of UFW.\nNick is a freelance tech. journalist, Linux enthusiast, and a long time PC gamer.\nOur latest tutorials delivered straight to your inbox\n","wordCount":"1244","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-11T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-11T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Arthur Wilson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-host-your-own-minecraft-server-252394/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock The Secret To Unlimited Minecraft Fun: Set Up Your Own Server Now!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-11 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 11, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1244 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Arthur Wilson</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#step-1-download-the-minecraft-server-software>Step 1: Download the Minecraft server software.</a></li><li><a href=#step-2-configure-the-server-properties>Step 2: Configure the server properties.</a></li><li><a href=#step-3-port-forwarding>Step 3: Port Forwarding</a></li><li><a href=#step-4-launch-the-server>Step 4: Launch the server.</a></li><li><a href=#step-5-customize-your-server>Step 5: Customize your server.</a></li><li><a href=#before-you-get-started>Before You Get Started</a></li><li><a href=#install-the-dependencies>Install the Dependencies</a></li><li><a href=#download-the-minecraft-server>Download the Minecraft Server</a></li><li><a href=#write-a-startup-script>Write a Startup Script</a></li><li><a href=#start-the-server>Start the Server</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=unlock-the-secret-to-unlimited-minecraft-fun-set-up-your-own-server-now>Unlock The Secret To Unlimited Minecraft Fun: Set Up Your Own Server Now!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#unlock-the-secret-to-unlimited-minecraft-fun-set-up-your-own-server-now>#</a></h1><p>Minecraft is one of the most beloved video games of all time.
