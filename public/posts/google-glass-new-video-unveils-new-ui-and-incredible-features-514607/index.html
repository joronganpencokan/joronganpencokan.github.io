Google Glass Unleashes Jaw-Dropping New UI and Game-Changing Features in Latest Video!\nThe world has been eagerly waiting for the next iteration of Google Glass, and it seems the wait has finally come to an end. Google has released a new video that showcases some jaw-dropping new features of the latest Google Glass, which include a new user interface (UI) and game-changing features that make it one of the most futuristic and innovative tech products in recent times.\nThe new UI is nothing short of revolutionary. It features a smart, unobtrusive design that allows users to access all the features of the device without being distracted from the real world. The new UI is much more intuitive and user-friendly than the previous versions, making it easy for new users to get familiar with it.\nOne of the most astonishing features of the new Google Glass is its ability to translate languages in real-time. The device can translate speech in real-time, which is truly remarkable. This feature is great for people who like to travel or work in multicultural environments. It can also provide an instant translation of a foreign language when reading a sign or a menu.\nAnother game-changing feature of the new Google Glass is its ability to assist people who are visually impaired. Using the device’s camera and machine learning, it can help users navigate through their surroundings. It can provide audio descriptions of objects and people in front of the wearer, enabling them to understand their surroundings better.\nThe latest Google Glass also comes with improved battery life, making it more convenient to use for extended periods. Additionally, the device is now water-resistant, which means that it can be used in all kinds of weather conditions.\nOverall, the new Google Glass is a significant step forward in wearable technology. With its innovative UI, real-time language translation, and assistive features for visually-impaired people, it is an exceptional device that has the potential to change people’s lives for the better.\nIn conclusion, Google Glass has done it again! The latest iteration of Google Glass has delivered a device that is futuristic, innovative, and truly revolutionary. With its new UI and game-changing features, the latest Google Glass is sure to be a hit with tech enthusiasts and casual users alike.\nGoogle unveiled a new demo video of the project Google Glass headset, offering a glance to the new user interface. The video, as reported by The Verge was released after the search giant announced its intentions to expand Glass pre-order program early on Wednesday.\nLast year’s preview showed a more proof-of-concept view, but the new video that Google is offering this time provides more details on the functionality and what you could actually be able to do with the device.\nWatching at the video suggests that users will be able control the device via voice-commands and record videos, take pictures, start a Google Hangout to video-chat, send and receive text messages and pictures, turn-by-turn directions (GPS) and much more. The new preview hints that Glass will also support on-screen translation.\nThe YouTube clip also shows Google Glass headset being used in different locations and weather. People who use the device are shown starting a new task by just saying “OK Glass” record a video or simply “Google” tiger heads.\nGallery Sometime ago the company started a pre-order program that was only available for developers and well-connected people (media). The glasses also had a price tag of $1,500, and although the price didn’t change, the search giant is now expanding the pre-order program for more people via a new contest.\nTo enter the contest “If I Had Glass” you must write 50 words or less on what you do, if you had a Google Glass. The entry has to be posted by February 27th, on Google+ or Twitter with the hashtag #ifihadglass. Once Google decides who wins, you’ll get one pre-production model of the device for free, but the catch is that you’ll need to pick up the glasses at one of the Google’s events in New York, Los Angeles or San Francisco — for more details visit the link above.\nUpdate: Today, Feb. 22, 2013, The Verge reports that Google Glass will go on sale to the general public before the end of 2013. This is ahead of schedule to the 2014 date that Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, anticipated last year.\nSource Google via The Verge | Prototype Images The Verge\n","wordCount":"743","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-07T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-07T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rhonda Torres"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/google-glass-new-video-unveils-new-ui-and-incredible-features-514607/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionary!
