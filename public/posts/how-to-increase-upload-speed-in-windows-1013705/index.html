Is your upload speed slower than a snail? Don’t worry, there is a simple trick that can help boost your upload speed on Windows. This trick is easy to implement, and it will not take much of your time. So, without further ado, let’s dive in.\nThe trick to boost your Windows upload speed is to adjust your network adapter settings. The default settings of your network adapter may not be optimized for uploading files, which can result in slow upload speed. However, you can change these settings manually to improve your upload speed.\nFirstly, open your Control Panel and go to the Network and Sharing Center. From there, click on Change adapter settings. You will see a list of all the network adapters on your computer. Right-click on the adapter that you are currently using for Internet connectivity and select Properties.\nIn the properties window, click on Configure and then select the Advanced tab. Here you will see a long list of network adapter settings that can be adjusted. However, we are only interested in two settings: the “Auto Negotiation” and “Flow Control” settings.\nTo boost your upload speed, set the “Auto Negotiation” setting to “100 Mbps Full Duplex.” This will force your network adapter to negotiate a full-duplex connection with the network, which will allow for more data to be sent and received simultaneously.\nNext, disable the “Flow Control” setting. This setting attempts to regulate the flow of data between devices on a network, which can cause data to be held up and slow down data transfer rates.\nOnce you have made these changes, click on OK and exit the properties window. You should notice an improvement in your upload speed immediately.\nIt’s important to note that the effect of this trick will vary depending on your internet connection speed and the file size you are uploading. However, it’s still worth trying out as it has been proven to work for many users.\nIn conclusion, tweaking your network adapter settings can help boost your Windows upload speed significantly. It’s a simple trick that only takes a few minutes to implement, and the results are often noticeable. So, give it a go and see if it works for you. Happy uploading!\nEven if PC or laptop users have a good enough internet connection, and experience slower download and upload speeds, they wonder how do I fix a slow upload speed.
