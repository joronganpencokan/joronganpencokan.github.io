Whether it’s checking your phone notifications, sending text messages, or even using apps that haven’t yet made the jump to the desktop, there are a lot of things you might want to do on your Android phone while you’re using your computer.\nBut what if we told you that there’s a way to control your Android device from your PC, without having to constantly reach for your phone? Believe it or not, it’s actually a lot easier than you might think. Here’s how to do it, using a tool called Mobizen.\nFirst things first: download and install Mobizen on both your Android device and your computer. Once you’ve done that, launch the Mobizen app on your phone and sign in with your account (you’ll need to create one the first time you use the app). Then, go to the Mobizen website on your computer and sign in there as well.\nFrom there, the process is pretty straightforward. You’ll see a representation of your Android device on your computer screen, and you can use your mouse and keyboard to control it just as you would on your phone. It works just like a remote desktop app, only instead of controlling a computer that’s somewhere else, you’re controlling your own device.\nOne of the coolest things about Mobizen is that it’s not just useful for accessing your phone’s screen; you can also use it to stream media files from your device to your computer. For example, if you have a movie saved on your phone that you want to watch on your computer’s bigger screen, you can use Mobizen to stream it directly to your PC.\nOverall, Mobizen is an incredibly useful tool for anyone who wants to be able to control their Android device from their PC. It’s easy to set up, even easier to use, and it’s free to download and install. So if you’re tired of constantly switching between your phone and your computer, give Mobizen a try and see how much easier it can make your life.\nIf probably heard of and even tried controlling a PC using android with successful results. There are tons of apps that can let you do that. But have you tried controlling your Android device from your PC? It is actually possible. But why would you want to do that? There may be various reasons, but one important reason is time management. If you’re working on your PC and you get a text or an alert of any kind and your Android is a meter away charging, you do not have to walk up there while leaving what you were working on your PC. You could just check it via the PC you’re on. There may be numerous scenarios, that’s for you to find out. There are software on PC that can help you control your Android; we have selected two that we think are the best. Here’s how to control Android using PC.\nControl Android using PC Mighty Text This application is available for free on both Android and PC. As the name suggests, Mighty Text was created for sending SMS and MMS from your Android using your PC, but it can do more than just those. You get alerts when the battery is low, receive calls and more. Mighty Text is a browser extension available for all major web browsers.\nIt being a web browser extension means you do not need to download and install PC software; all you need is a web browser (which is in every PC) and you’re good to go. You also need a small app on your Android, which can be downloaded for free from the Google Play Store.\nAir Droid Air Droid is another web extension that doesn’t require big installation files. Instead of just controlling some function of your Android, AirDroid can give you full control of your device. You need a browser extension on your PC and an application on your Android to use AirDroid. You will need to register for an Air Droid account.\nUsing this extension, you can get threaded SMS messages, transfer files between PC and Android without a cable, you can manage apps installed in your Android, receive phone calls, and much more. There’s also the feature to find your Android.\nThis is it. These two are what we think are the best ways to control your Android via your PC. Since both of these are browser extension, you do not need to worry about downloading and installing a client on your PC.\nAlso Read:\nHow to Remap Google Pixel 4 motion sensor\nHow to Delete your phone number from Truecaller\nHow to Schedule deletion of Google History\nHow to Share VPN on Android\nTAGSAndroidAndroid How toAndroid Tipshow to android tricks\nHow to Fix Samsung Galaxy S22 Overheating?
