With its focus on survival and exploration, it is essential for players to have adequate inventory space. A lack of storage space can hinder your progress by forcing you to discard or leave essential items behind, ultimately leading to your demise. In this article, we will explore the ultimate inventory hack that can help you skyrocket your storage space in The Callisto Protocol.\nTip #1 - Maximize Your Backpack Space\nYour backpack is your primary source of inventory space in The Callisto Protocol. It’s essential to utilize it to its full potential. The game provides various backpack sizes, and it’s essential to choose the right one to suit your playstyle. Larger backpacks have more carrying capacity but come with slower movement speeds, making it harder to avoid threats. Smaller backpacks may have fewer slots, but you can move around more quickly.\nWhen traveling around Callisto Station, players should try to prioritize necessary items that will help them survive. However, suppose you find yourself coming across more items than you can store. In that case, it might be worth going back through your inventory and reassessing what you need to keep and what you can sacrifice.\nTip #2 - Upgrade Your Inventory Capacity\nIn The Callisto Protocol, players can upgrade their inventory space by finding specific items throughout the game. These items, known as implant chips, can be inserted into your character that upgrades your inventory space. Keep an eye out for these implant chips in the game by exploring all the areas of Callisto Station.\nTip #3 - Use Your Storage Pods\nStorage pods are scattered throughout Callisto Station, and they provide you with extra storage space that you can access from multiple locations. Make sure to use these storage pods to your advantage by storing items that you don’t need immediately, freeing up valuable backpack space.\nTip #4 - Organize Your Inventory\nOrganizing your inventory is essential to help you manage your resources efficiently. In The Callisto Protocol, it’s easy to pick up every item that you come across. However, carrying too many items can slow you down, making you an easy target for any adversaries. By organizing your inventory, you can prioritize what items are most important to your survival and allow you to move around more efficiently.\nTip #5 - Prioritize Essential Items\nAs previously mentioned, it’s crucial to prioritize inventory items that will aid your survival. Medkits, ammo, and batteries are just a few items that you should prioritize in your inventory space. However, it’s essential to consider potential circumstances that might arise, such as isolated areas with limited opportunities for restocking. Ensure that you plan accordingly when filling up your inventory slots.\nIn conclusion, storage space is a critical aspect of survival in The Callisto Protocol. By using the ultimate inventory hack tips, players can easily manage their storage space and survive the dangers that Callisto Station presents. Whether by maximizing backpack space, upgrading capacity, using storage pods, organizing inventory, or prioritizing essential items, having a well-thought-out inventory management plan is crucial in navigating the game’s various challenges.\nThe Callisto Protocol is a horror-survival videogame and the most recent addition by the Striking Distance Studios. You play Jacob Lee, an inmate of the Black Iron Prison stuck on the Callisto moon. As you progress, you will face several monstrous enemies and bosses along the way. While you get different weapons, you also need supplies like ammo and health to survive the prison. You get six inventory slots to store these resources or supplies. But several players are confused about increasing their inventory.
