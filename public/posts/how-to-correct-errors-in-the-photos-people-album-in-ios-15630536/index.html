Firstly, it makes it easier to find photos of specific people in your collection. For instance, if you want to show your friend some pictures of your trip to Hawaii, you can now simply search for their face and find all the photos you took together.\nSecondly, it enhances the accuracy of facial recognition. The more you curate the People album, the better the algorithm becomes at recognizing faces. This will save you time in the future when you want to locate a specific photo.\nFinally, it makes your photo collection more organized and aesthetic. The People album is an excellent way to segment your photos into categories, and when it is accurate, it becomes a visually pleasing way to browse your collection.\nConclusion Mistakes in the People album in iOS 15 can be frustrating, but they are easy to fix.
