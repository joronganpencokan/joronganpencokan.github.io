Unlock the secret to effortlessly importing your downloaded music into iTunes today!\nThis article explains how to add music to iTunes either by copying a shortcut to its location on the computer or by physically importing the file into an iTunes-specified folder.\nWhat to Know\nAdd a shortcut to iTunes: In iTunes, choose File \u003e Add to Library. Go to the location of the music. Select the files and choose Open.Add files to an iTunes folder: Select Edit (PC) or iTunes (Mac) \u003e Preferences \u003e Advanced \u003e Copy files to iTunes media folder. How to Add Music to iTunes Using Shortcuts With streaming music and digital music stores so popular, you may not download MP3s from the internet very often. But now and then, especially if you download live concert recordings or listen to lectures, you’ll need to grab individual files.\nAdding music to iTunes so you can sync it with your iOS device or listen to your music on your computer takes only a few clicks.\nMake sure you know the location of your downloaded audio files. The files may be in your Downloads folder or somewhere on your Desktop. Open iTunes. Click the File menu, and then click Add to Library. A window pops up that allows you to navigate your computer’s hard drive. Navigate to the folder or location of the files you want to import. Select the files or folders you want to add, and then click Open to generate a shortcut in iTunes to the music. Check that iTunes added the files by opening the Music option from the drop-down near the top left corner in iTunes. Choose Songs, and then click the Date Added column to view the most recently added songs. When you add songs, iTunes should automatically categorize them by name, artist, album, etc. If the songs imported without the artist and other information, you can manually change the ID3 tags yourself.\nMake sure you know the location of your downloaded audio files. The files may be in your Downloads folder or somewhere on your Desktop.\nOpen iTunes.\nClick the File menu, and then click Add to Library.\nA window pops up that allows you to navigate your computer’s hard drive. Navigate to the folder or location of the files you want to import.\nSelect the files or folders you want to add, and then click Open to generate a shortcut in iTunes to the music.\nCheck that iTunes added the files by opening the Music option from the drop-down near the top left corner in iTunes. Choose Songs, and then click the Date Added column to view the most recently added songs.\nYou can also drag and drop your MP3 files directly into iTunes.\nHow Copy Music Into iTunes Media Folder Usually, when you add music to iTunes, what you see in the program are just references to the actual location of the files. For example, if you copy an MP3 from your desktop into iTunes, you’re not moving the file. Instead, you’re adding a shortcut to its location on the desktop.\nIf you move the original file, iTunes can’t find it and won’t be able to play it until you manually locate it again. One way to avoid this is to have iTunes copy music files into a dedicated folder. Then, even if the original is moved or deleted, iTunes still retains a copy of it.\nTo do this, follow these steps:\nIn iTunes, click Edit (on a PC) or​ iTunes (on a Mac), and then click Preferences On the Advanced tab, check Copy files to iTunes Media Folder when adding to library. Click OK to save your changes. Once this option is on, newly imported songs are added to the \\iTunes Media\\ folder within the user’s account. The files are organized based on the artist and album name.\nIn iTunes, click Edit (on a PC) or​ iTunes (on a Mac), and then click Preferences\nOn the Advanced tab, check Copy files to iTunes Media Folder when adding to library.\nClick OK to save your changes.\nFor example, if you drag a song called “favoritesong.mp3” into iTunes with this setting enabled, it will go into a folder like this: C:\\Users[username]\\Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media[artist][album]\\favoritesong.mp3.\nConverting Other Formats to MP3 Not all songs you download from the internet will be in the MP3 format (you’re likely to find AAC or FLAC, these days). If you want to have your files in a different format, the easiest way to convert them is to use the converter built into iTunes itself. You can also use free audio converter websites and apps to do the job.\nOther Ways to Add Music to iTunes Downloading MP3s isn’t the only way to add music to your library.
