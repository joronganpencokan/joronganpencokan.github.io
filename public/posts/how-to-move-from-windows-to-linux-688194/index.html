If so, then it’s time to switch to Linux. Linux is an operating system that is free, open-source, and provides users with unparalleled customization options. In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know to make the switch from Windows to Linux.\nChoose a Linux Distribution\nThe first step in switching to Linux is deciding what distribution to use. A distribution is a version of Linux that has been modified and packaged for a particular purpose. Some of the most popular distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, and Mint. Each distribution has its own set of features and strengths, so it’s important to do your research and choose the one that suits your needs.\nBackup Your Data\nBefore you make the switch to Linux, it’s essential to back up all of your important data. Be sure to save files, photos, videos, and anything else that you don’t want to lose onto an external hard drive or cloud storage service.\nCreate a Bootable USB Drive\nOnce you’ve chosen your Linux distribution and backed up your data, it’s time to create a bootable USB drive. This will allow you to boot into the Linux environment and try it out before you commit to installing it on your computer.\nInstall Linux\nIf you’ve decided that Linux is right for you, it’s time to install it on your computer. Depending on the distribution you’ve chosen, the installation process may vary slightly, but it will generally involve creating a bootable USB drive, booting into Linux, and then following the on-screen prompts.\nGet to Know the Linux Environment\nOnce you’ve installed Linux, take some time to get to know the environment. Linux is a little different from Windows, so it may take some time to get used to. Spend some time exploring the file system, installing applications, and customizing the desktop to your liking.\nInstall Applications\nOne of the great things about Linux is the vast array of open-source applications available for download. Many Linux distributions come pre-installed with a suite of productivity tools, including a web browser, word processor, and spreadsheet application. However, you can expand your toolkit by downloading additional applications from the distribution’s software center or repository.\nCustomize Your Desktop\nLinux provides users with unparalleled customization options, so take some time to tweak your desktop to your liking. Change the wallpaper, add widgets to your desktop, and install a custom theme to make it truly yours.\nConclusion\nSwitching from Windows to Linux may seem daunting at first, but with the right guidance, it can be a smooth and rewarding experience. Follow the steps outlined in this guide, and you’ll be up and running in no time. Say goodbye to sluggish performance, constant updates, and high prices, and hello to the free, open-source world of Linux.\nAfter years of using Windows, you’re finally fed up with it and have decided to give Linux a try. Linux, though, is available through many different distributions. Which one should you choose? And will you be able to do everything in Linux that you did in Windows? Read on to find out how you can smoothly move from Windows to Linux!\nNote: If you are still on the fence, not sure if you should switch to Linux from Windows, check out the commonly-asked questions and see if they answer your doubts.\nStart by Picking a Linux Distribution There are thousands of Linux distributions out there, and it can be confusing just to read how one is different from the others. To get started, you may want to try Ubuntu, not because it is the easiest to use, but because it is the most popular. Thanks to its millions of users, you can easily find help if you run into issues (which you are bound to do).\nIf you are looking for a desktop that looks and feel like Windows, you can check out these Linux distributions for Windows users. If you are just getting started with Linux, these Linux distributions are good for beginners.\nWorthy Alternatives Other than Ubuntu, some worthy alternatives you could look into are:\nUbuntu “flavors”: for everyone who wants all the support that comes with Ubuntu but doesn’t like its default desktop and appsMint: for those who like a user-friendly distro that uses the stable Ubuntu as its backboneManjaro: a rolling release distro which will always keep your operating system up to date.Debian: for those who want even more stability or to avoid any hint of closed-source software Installing Linux on Your PC The steps to install Linux are almost universal:\nDownload the ISO file.Create a bootable flash drive.Boot your PC with the flash drive. You have a choice to test the live desktop or follow the instructions to install it on your system. For the installation, start by selecting the hard disk drive where you want to install your new operating system. You can choose a different partition or device if you wish to keep Windows intact or erase the disk where your current OS resides and replace it with Linux.\nThe rest of the options you’ll meet are pretty straightforward and don’t need an explanation. You will be asked to select your preferred language for the OS interface and the keyboard, your geographical position (used for geolocation and time-syncing), and set up your primary user account with an alias and a password.\nStart Using Your New Desktop Depending on the Linux distribution you are using, you will have different desktop environments. Gnome 3 is used by Ubuntu while Linux Mint is using Cinnamon.\nCheck out our user guides for the various desktop environments:\nGnome 3KDECinnamonXFCEMatePantheon Set It Up/Customize It/Make It Your Own Although each desktop environment in Linux comes with its own settings, they are all much better organized and easy to tweak compared to how the same options are organized in Windows. In other words, if you are able to make sense of Windows 10 settings, customizing your Linux desktop environment will be child’s play.\nRun the Settings app found in your distribution’s main menu and go through the categories of options, one by one, to:\nChoose a themeChange the wallpaperControl notificationsSelect your preferred applicationsSync online accountsSet up sharingConfigure your hardware An App for Everything A lot of the software you probably used in Windows is also available for Linux. For some of the more prominent commercial applications, though, like Microsoft Office, or the members of Adobe’s suite, you will have to find alternatives. Thankfully, most of them are more than up to the task, so you won’t feel like you’re missing something.\nSome of the most popular apps for different tasks are:\nBrowsers: Firefox, Chromium, Chrome, OperaInternet/Networking: Skype, Pidgin, UFW, ReminaAntivirus: you don’t need oneProductivity/Office: LibreOffice, qOwnNotesAudio/Video: VLC, Audacity, Kdenlive, HandbrakeGraphics/Photo Editing: GIMP, Darktable, Gwenview, InkScape, PencilSheep Most Linux distributions come with a Software Center or Package Manager where you can easily find software to install.\nLinux was never considered a gaming powerhouse, but thanks to Valve’s efforts, it now has access to a significant chunk of Steam’s collection. And projects like Lutris can help you manage all your games.\nLearn to Love the Terminal As a newcomer to Linux, you may try to avoid the terminal. Still, like everyone else, in time, you will find it irreplaceable. We suggest you start getting familiar with the basics. Before you realize it, you’ll find it’s become your primary means of interaction with your computer and is much more powerful and versatile than any GUI.\nWe should warn you, though, that moving from Windows to Linux is addictive in. You may soon find yourself in an endless cycle of distro-hopping, moving from distribution to distribution, trying to find the perfect one as if you were playing Pokémon.\nIf you have recently moved from Windows to Linux, let us know in the comments below.\nOK’s real life started at around 10, when he got his first computer - a Commodore 128.
