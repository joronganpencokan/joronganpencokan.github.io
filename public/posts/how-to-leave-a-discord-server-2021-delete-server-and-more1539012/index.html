However, there may come a time when you want to leave a server for various reasons. But did you know that leaving a Discord server in 2021 is easier than ever? In this article, we’ll show you how to master the DELETE button and more to make the process quick and easy.\nStep 1: Dealing with notifications\nBefore you leave a Discord server, it’s essential to deal with any notifications you may have. If you have any unread messages, mentions or pings, take some time to handle them. This way, you won’t miss anything important or interesting. Simply click on the notification icon and respond, react or clear them as needed.\nStep 2: Leave the server\nOnce you’ve dealt with your notifications, it’s time to leave the server. To do this, go to the server you want to leave and right-click on it. A dropdown menu will appear, and you’ll see the option to “Leave Server.” Click on it, and you’ll be asked to confirm your decision. Click on “Leave Server” again, and that’s it! You’re no longer a member of that Discord server.\nStep 3: Remove the server from your list\nLeaving the server doesn’t mean it disappears from your list automatically. If you don’t want to see it, you’ll need to remove it manually. To do this, click on the “Settings” icon next to the server name. Choose the “Delete Server” option, and a warning message will appear. Click on “Delete Server” to confirm, and the server will disappear from your list.\nStep 4: Additional tips\nIf you’re an admin of a server and you’re planning to leave, make sure to transfer ownership before doing so. You can do this by going to “Server Settings,” choosing “Members,” and selecting a member to transfer ownership to.\nYou can also mute and archive a server if you want to take a break but not necessarily leave forever. Muting a server means you won’t receive any notifications, while archiving a server will keep all the information but hide it from your list.\nConclusion:\nLeaving a Discord server in 2021 is a quick and easy process, and mastering the DELETE button is just the beginning. By following these simple steps and additional tips, you can leave a server without any stress or hassle. Whether you’re leaving due to a lack of interest, drama, or personal reasons, remember that it’s okay to prioritize your mental and emotional well-being.
