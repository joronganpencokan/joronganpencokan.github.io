Smart TV’s built-in screen mirroring is a feature that allows you to display the screen of your phone or tablet on your smart TV. It uses screen mirroring technology to wirelessly connect your phone or tablet to the TV and share its screen with the TV. This is useful for a variety of purposes, such as watching videos or photos from your phone on a bigger screen, playing mobile games on a TV, or presenting a slide show on a TV.

It allows you to wirelessly stream audio and video from your phone, tablet, or laptop to a larger display, without the need for cables or a separate streaming device. Miracast requires a Wi-Fi connection to work, so it is not possible to use it to mirror your phone to a TV without Wi-Fi.\nHowever, there is an option to use a screen-mirroring technology that does not require Wi-Fi, such as Miracast over a wireless display (Wi-Fi Direct). In this case, you will need a TV or a streaming device that supports Miracast over Wi-Fi Direct and a phone that also supports the feature. This allows you to create a direct connection between the phone and the TV, without needing for a Wi-Fi network.\nWe hope by now you would have at least got an idea of how connect phone to TV without Wi-Fi.\nMethod 4: Use Bluetooth Dongle In the context of screen mirroring, a Bluetooth dongle can be used to connect a phone to a TV that does not have built-in Bluetooth capability. By plugging the dongle into the TV’s USB port, you can establish a Bluetooth connection between the phone and the TV, allowing you to mirror the phone’s screen to the TV.\nKeep in mind that using a Bluetooth dongle for screen mirroring may result in a lower-quality image and audio compared to a wired connection or a Wi-Fi-based screen-mirroring technology. It may also be prone to interference and may not be suitable for streaming video content.\nHere is a general outline of the steps you can follow to do this:\nFirst, make sure that your TV and phone are paired with the Bluetooth dongle or transmitter.\nOn your phone, go to the settings menu and look for the Bluetooth or Connections option.\nEnable Bluetooth and search for available devices. Select the TV or the Bluetooth dongle from the list of available devices.\nOnce your phone is connected to the TV or the dongle, you should be able to mirror your phone’s screen to the TV.

Smart TV’s built-in screen mirroring is a feature that allows you to display the screen of your phone or tablet on your smart TV. It uses screen mirroring technology to wirelessly connect your phone or tablet to the TV and share its screen with the TV. This is useful for a variety of purposes, such as watching videos or photos from your phone on a bigger screen, playing mobile games on a TV, or presenting a slide show on a TV. These can also help to learn how to connect phone to Tv without Wi-Fi.</p><p>If you want a general idea of how to mirror android phone to TV without Wi-Fi, follow the steps:</p><ol><li><p>On your phone, go to Settings > Display > Cast Screen.</p></li><li><p>Enable screen casting on your phone by turning on the toggle switch or selecting Enable wireless display.</p></li><li><p>On your TV, go to the input source menu and select screen mirroring smart view, or a similar option.</p></li><li><p>Your TV should now start searching for nearby devices that are available for screen mirroring.</p></li><li><p>On your phone, select your TV from the list of available devices.</p></li><li><p>You should now see your phone’s screen mirrored on your TV.</p></li></ol><p>The exact steps for doing this will vary depending on the make and model of your TV and phone or tablet.

Chromecast is a device made by Google that allows you to stream video, music, and other content from your phone, tablet, or computer to a TV. These will help you stream from phone to Tv without Wi-Fi. To use the Chromecast to mirror your phone to a TV, you’ll need to have a Chromecast device and the Google Home app installed on your phone. Then, you can use the screen mirroring feature on your phone to connect to the Chromecast and share your phone’s screen on the TV. The exact steps for doing this will vary depending on your phone and Chromecast models.</p><p>Here’s how to do it:</p><ol><li><p>Make sure your Chromecast is plugged into your TV and that both your phone and the Chromecast are connected to the same Wi-Fi network</p></li><li><p>On your phone, launch the Google Home app.</p></li><li><p>You can cast to a device by tapping it.</p></li><li><p>Tap Cast Screen.</p></li></ol><p>Your phone’s screen will now be mirrored on your TV.</p><p>Also Read: How to Mirror Your Android or iPhone Screen to Chromecast</p><h3 id=method-3-use-miracast-app-mirror>Method 3: Use Miracast App Mirror<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#method-3-use-miracast-app-mirror>#</a></h3><p>Miracast is a screen-mirroring protocol that allows you to share the screen of one device to another display, such as a TV or a computer monitor. It allows you to wirelessly stream audio and video from your phone, tablet, or laptop to a larger display, without the need for cables or a separate streaming device. Miracast requires a Wi-Fi connection to work, so it is not possible to use it to mirror your phone to a TV without Wi-Fi.</p><p>However, there is an option to use a screen-mirroring technology that does not require Wi-Fi, such as Miracast over a wireless display (Wi-Fi Direct). In this case, you will need a TV or a streaming device that supports Miracast over Wi-Fi Direct and a phone that also supports the feature. This allows you to create a direct connection between the phone and the TV, without needing for a Wi-Fi network.</p><p>We hope by now you would have at least got an idea of how connect phone to TV without Wi-Fi.</p><h3 id=method-4-use-bluetooth-dongle>Method 4: Use Bluetooth Dongle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#method-4-use-bluetooth-dongle>#</a></h3><p>In the context of screen mirroring, a Bluetooth dongle can be used to connect a phone to a TV that does not have built-in Bluetooth capability. By plugging the dongle into the TV’s USB port, you can establish a Bluetooth connection between the phone and the TV, allowing you to mirror the phone’s screen to the TV.</p><p>Keep in mind that using a Bluetooth dongle for screen mirroring may result in a lower-quality image and audio compared to a wired connection or a Wi-Fi-based screen-mirroring technology. It may also be prone to interference and may not be suitable for streaming video content.</p><p>Here is a general outline of the steps you can follow to do this:</p><ol><li><p>First, make sure that your TV and phone are paired with the Bluetooth dongle or transmitter.</p></li><li><p>On your phone, go to the settings menu and look for the Bluetooth or Connections option.</p></li><li><p>Enable Bluetooth and search for available devices. Select the TV or the Bluetooth dongle from the list of available devices.</p></li><li><p>Once your phone is connected to the TV or the dongle, you should be able to mirror your phone’s screen to the TV. Depending on your phone’s operating system and the TV’s capabilities, you may need to use a specific app or feature to initiate screen mirroring.</p></li></ol><p>Also Read: How to Mirror Android Screen to your PC without Root</p><h3 id=method-5-use-wired-connection>Method 5: Use Wired Connection<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#method-5-use-wired-connection>#</a></h3><p>If your laptop has an HDMI output port and your TV has an HDMI input port, you can use an HDMI cable to connect the two devices and use your laptop as a bridge to share the screen of your phone with the TV.

If your phone and TV support Chromecast, you can use your phone’s mobile hotspot to connect the Chromecast to the internet. To do this, you will need to enable the mobile hotspot on your phone and connect the Chromecast to the hotspot using the Chromecast app. Once the connection is established, you should be able to use your phone to cast content to the TV.</p><p>However, using a mobile hotspot for screen mirroring may result in a slower and less stable connection, and may not be suitable for streaming video content.
