As more and more data is created, we find ourselves needing more storage space constantly. However, sometimes we simply don’t have the space, or we need to transfer large files over the internet, which can take a long time due to the size of the file. This is where file compression becomes an important tool. By compressing files, we can reduce their size without losing their quality, making them easier to transfer and store. In this article, we’ll discuss the benefits of file compression and how to create the ultimate zip file.\nWhat is File Compression? Simply put, file compression is the process of reducing the size of a file. Files like images, videos, and documents, contain a lot of redundant information that can be removed without affecting the quality of the file. By encoding the file using complex algorithms, we can remove this redundant information and thus reduce the size of the file. The compressed file can then be stored or transferred, and when it’s needed again, it can be uncompressed back to its original size.\nThe Benefits of File Compression There are many benefits to file compression. Here are a few of the main ones:\nSaves Storage Space: By compressing files, we can save valuable storage space on our devices.\nSaves Bandwidth: Compressed files can be transferred more quickly and with less bandwidth usage. This is particularly useful when transferring files over the internet.\nImproves File Organization: By compressing multiple files into a single zip file, we can improve file organization and make it easier to find and manage our files.\nProtects Files: Compressed files can be password protected, which adds an extra layer of security.\nPreserves the Quality of the File: Compressed files do not lose any quality during the compression process, so the files will look and work the same as the original.\nHow to Create the Ultimate Zip File Now that we understand what file compression is and its benefits, let’s discuss how to create the ultimate zip file.\nSelect the files you want to compress: Start by selecting the files you want to compress. Make sure to only select files that you need to keep and not any temporary files or files that can be easily recovered.\nChoose a compression tool: There are many compression tools available, such as WinZip, 7-Zip or WinRAR. Choose the one that suits your needs and install it on your device.\nCompress the files: Once you’ve installed the compression tool, you can simply follow the prompts to compress your files. You can choose to compress the files into a single compressed folder or create multiple compressed folders if you have a large number of files.\nSet Compression Settings: Compression tools allow you to set the compression settings to suit the type of files you are compressing. For example, some files types do not compress well, while others do.\nAdd a Password: If you need to protect your files, you can add a password to the compressed folder. This will ensure that only authorized users can extract the files.\nTest the Compressed Files: Before transferring or storing your compressed files, make sure to test them to ensure that the files are still intact and can be easily extracted.\nWith these simple steps, you will be able to create the ultimate zip file that is easy to transfer, store, and secure.\nConclusion File compression is a valuable tool that everyone can utilize to help manage their file storage and transfer. Compressed files save valuable storage space, reduce bandwidth usage, improve file organization, protect files, preserve file quality, and more. By following the steps mentioned in this article, you can create the ultimate zip file and take advantage of all the benefits of file compression.\nZIP folders are great, cramming their constituent files into one big happy package that’s bursting at the seams, ready to spill out onto your PC when you need to use them. But what are your experiences with creating ZIP files? If you’re like most people, then probably frustrating, as you struggle to compress the files as much as you’d like. Here we’ll show you how to create a zip file that actually saves you space.\nNot All Files Compress Well It’s easy to assume that if you’re using good compression software, all the files you’re compressing will shrink by a fair amount. If only it were so simple. The fact is that some files compress much better than others.\nAudio, video and image file types come in various formats, some of which are already heavily compressed, while others aren’t. So while you shouldn’t expect to get much compression out of JPEGs, TIFF or RAW files can be squeezed down plenty, or WAV and AIFF files can compress quite a lot while MP3s can’t, so bear all that in mind.\nWhich Is the Best ZIP Software? Popular opinion on this is split, but from our comparison between WinZip, 7Zip and WinRAR, 7-Zip came out marginally on top, taking into account the fact that it was free while you’d have to pay to use WinZip over the long haul. So for our guide, we’ll be using 7Zip.\nHow to Create a ZIP File First up, download and install 7-Zip. Once you have it up and running, gather all the files you want to zip up into a single folder, ready for compression. Next, right-click that folder, click 7-Zip, then “Add to archive.”\nIn the 7-Zip window you’ll be presented with a whole bunch of options, and it’s worth having a general idea of what they do.\nArchive format: Out of the options here, 7-zip’s proprietary compression format, 7z, does the best job of compression, so we recommend using this. Note that whoever is unzipping this will need to also have 7-Zip installed.\nCompression level: Self-explanatory, really. To get maximum compression out of your files (at the expense of a longer compression process), select “Ultra.”\nCompression method: There are quite a few choices here, but the best one hands down is LZMA 2, particularly if your PC has a quad-core or stronger processor. LZMA 2 is the most modern method of compression out there and should be compatible with most modern systems.\nDictionary size: Generally, the bigger the dictionary size, the more compression you get, but some users have said that this only applies up to a point. Up to 128MB you can make big gains, but above that it’s only incremental – you’re not saving that much space and are making the compression process longer.\nWord Size: Like Dictionary Size, the bigger the better in theory, but this is dependent on what kind of files you’re compressing so there is no universal rule. By default, word size will be 64MB if you’re using the LZMA or LZMA2 compression method, and that’s good enough.\nSolid Block Size: This bunches files of a similar size together, increasing compression even further. However, this will only make a notable difference if all the files you’re compressing are similar, which is unlikely. Best leave it as the default 4GB.\nWith all these settings in mind, below are the settings I chose to compress my Morrowind mods folder.\nBefore hitting “OK” to start the zipping process, you can also choose to “Split to volumes” which will break your zip archive into several smaller ones, (They then need to all be in the same folder when you unzip them.) and you can also add encryption to your archive if security is a priority.\nWhen you’re ready, hit OK and let the zipping commence!\nUsing the above settings, I compressed 1.1GB of all manner of mod-related files down to 398MB, which is pretty good if I say so myself.\nConclusion With the above guide you should be up and zipping in no time, creating well-compressed files using what we consider to be the best zipping method available. Of course, so much of file compression depends on the actual files you’re compressing, so be aware that results may vary.\nContent Manager at Make Tech Easier.
