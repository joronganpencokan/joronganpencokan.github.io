Install now and transform your desktop into a work of art!\nLooking at the same old boring Windows 10 desktop day in and day out can get quite tedious. Whether you use your computer for work, gaming, or leisure activities, a bland desktop can be uninspiring and demotivate you. But worry not because you can easily transform your Windows 10 desktop into a visual masterpiece by installing custom themes.\nCustom themes allow you to personalize every aspect of your Windows 10 desktop, from the wallpaper to the icons, taskbar, cursors, and much more. You can choose an existing theme or create your own to match your mood or overall style. Here are some of the insanely cool custom themes that can revamp your Windows 10 desktop and elevate it to a whole new level.\nSimplify 10: This theme sports a clean and minimalist design that is perfect if you want to declutter your desktop. Simplify 10 comes with four variations of its iconic black-and-white theme, each with different icons, cursors, and start menus to choose from.\nSilk: Silk is a theme that exudes luxury and elegance. It features a silky pink and white color scheme and comes with over 200 custom icons, wallpapers, and sounds that create a seamless user experience.\nVanilla: As the name suggests, Vanilla is a simple, yet elegant theme with soft beige tones that blend perfectly with modern Windows 10 design. It includes custom icons, cursors, and wallpapers that give your desktop a warm and inviting feel.\nFlare: Flare is a high contrast theme that uses vivid colors and sharp gradients to give your desktop that extra pop. It features flat icons, stylish cursors, and wallpapers that are guaranteed to make your desktop stand out.\nArctic: If you are a fan of snow, then this theme is for you. Arctic features a breathtakingly beautiful snow-capped mountain as its background, and the icons and wallpapers complement it perfectly. You can even customize the start menu to have a transparent snowy effect.\nDark/Grey: This theme is excellent for those who want to give their desktop a more serious and subdued mood. It features a neutral gray color scheme that is easy on the eyes and several custom icons and cursors to choose from.\nDiversityx VS: Diversityx VS is a dynamic and highly customizable theme that lets you choose from 16 custom colors and over 200 different icons. It also features a sleek taskbar and a start menu that can be customized to your liking.\nIn conclusion, installing a custom theme is an easy and affordable way to give your Windows 10 desktop a fresh and exciting look. With these insanely cool themes, you can easily revamp your desktop and turn it into a work of art that reflects your personality and style. So why wait? Download your favorite custom theme now and breathe new life into your desktop!\nWindows 10 is a versatile platform when it comes to customization. One of the best (or at least most visually striking) examples of this is in the huge variety of alternative themes you can apply to it, capable of changing that flat W10 desktop into something different entirely.\nWhether you want to stick to the safety of Microsoft’s official online theme collection, or peruse some of the incredibly creative Windows 10 themes at DeviantArt, we’ll show you how to install custom Windows 10 themes, along with all the necessary precautions.\nOnce you learn how to install your own themes, make sure to check out our list of the best Windows 10 themes.\nMicrosoft and Non-Microsoft Themes Themes can be found in a few places. Microsoft actually makes quite a few available from their own website. However, the most interesting themes are available on sites like DeviantArt where independent designers create their own packs.\nNon-Microsoft themes can’t be installed by default, however. We’ll first need to loosen Microsoft’s restrictions on theme installations.\nHow to Install Microsoft Themes If you want to install one of Microsoft’s themes, it’s very straightforward.\nDownload the desired theme from the Microsoft website.\nOnce the theme has downloaded, double-click on the downloaded “.themepack” file to add the theme to your theme library and immediately apply it.\nYou can also apply themes from the Personalization menu. Just right-click an empty space on the desktop background and click “Personalize.”\nHere you can select a new theme from the pane on the left or make your own adjustments to the existing one – like changing the font style, background and colors. For more on how to use this area, check out our guide on creating your own Windows 10 themes.\nHow to Install Non-Microsoft Themes If you’re feeling adventurous, you can also patch your system to allow for the installation of non-Microsoft themes.\nMake a backup! Using a theme that doesn’t match can nuke your system, and there’s a non-negligible chance of that happening. A restore point is good, but an image backup is even better.\nDownload and install UltraUXThemePatcher (no longer available).\nFind themes on websites like DeviantArt.\nCopy theme files into “C:/Windows/Resources/Themes.” If the file contains themes for multiple builds of Windows 10, make sure you’re using the right one. You can find your build by pressing Win + R and typing winver into the command line.\nClick on the theme you want to apply from Control Panel’s Personalization menu.\nConclusion It’s not too complicated to install new Windows 10 themes, though you need to be careful with the unofficial ones, as doing the process wrong may bork your PC. With that in mind, have fun giving your Windows 10 desktop a fresh new face!\nImage credit: EpicCartoonsFan\nContent Manager at Make Tech Easier.
