Hideo Kojima Teams Up with Junji Ito for a Terrifying New Horror Game!\nFor years, fans of horror games have been clamoring for a new title that will chill their bones and leave them on the edge of their seats. Well, it seems like their prayers have finally been answered as legendary game designer, Hideo Kojima, and horror manga artist, Junji Ito, have joined forces to create what promises to be the most bone-chilling horror game of all time.\nKojima, who is no stranger to horror, having previously worked on the iconic Silent Hill series, has been teasing fans about his latest project for months now. And while details are scarce, it’s clear that this new game is going to be something special.\nPartnering with Ito, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest horror manga artists of all time, Kojima seems determined to create an experience that will haunt players long after they’ve put down the controller.\nFor those unfamiliar with Ito’s work, his stories are known for their use of unsettling imagery, twisted plotlines, and surreal environments. The idea of his artwork coming to life in a video game is enough to make even the most hardened horror fans squirm.\nKojima has been working on this project since late last year, and has been actively teasing fans about its development. In a recent interview with Japanese magazine Famitsu, Kojima spoke about his collaboration with Ito, saying, “I am working on a horror game that will make you pee your pants. It’s been nine years since I’ve made a horror game, and I’m excited to be working with Junji Ito to create something truly terrifying.”\nWhile Kojima was tight-lipped about the details of the game, he did mention that it will feature a “unique concept” and that he is trying to create an experience that will scare players in a way they have never been scared before.\nThis is exciting news for fans of horror games, who have been craving a terrifying experience like this for years. And with Kojima and Ito at the helm, there is no doubt that this game is going to be something special.\nSo, are you ready to face your worst nightmares? Get ready, because Hideo Kojima and Junji Ito are coming for you.\nSince Hideo Kojima was involved in Silent Hills, which is a horror game by Konami whose cancellation is still painfully felt among fans of the genre, there has been a talk and speculation about the possibility of making a game within this theme.\nNew evidence has emerged that this possibility is very real, thanks to an interview with Junji Ito, a master of the horror genre in Japanese manga. An interview conducted at Comic-Con revealed that Hideo Kojima invited Ito to a horror game he may develop.\nAnswering the question of whether he was involved in a video game project, the horror master said the following: “The simple answer is no. However, I do know director Kojima and we have been in conversation that he might have a horror-based game that he may be doing, and so he has invited me to work on that, but there are no details on it yet,” said Junji Ito (through his translator).\nApparently, the horror project between Hideo Kojima and Junji Ito is still hypothetical and is not based on solid bases. Still, it is enough to leave us day-dreaming. A horror game made in collaboration between the two could become one of the best of its kind.\nCheck out the Comic-Con interview with Junji Ito (the question about the video game is at the 34th minute) below.\nIncidentally, the fact that Kojima and the Mangaka come together for art is nothing new. Back then, Ito contributed concept arts for Silent Hills, which Guillermo del Toro shared on his Twitter account.\nJUNJI ITO, undisputed master of horror in Japan (along with Hino and Tsubaki) and our collaborator in SILENT HILL (S) pic.twitter.com/D9ypKBhVk5\n— Guillermo del Toro (@RealGDT) September 27, 2015\nThe artist is now considered the leading master in his field. So it could be an exciting matter if Junji Ito and Hideo Kojima work together again in a horror game.\n","wordCount":"707","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Robert Nelson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/hideo-kojima-in-talks-with-junji-ito-for-a-new-horror-game-1983210/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Are You Ready to Face Your Worst Nightmares?
