Do you have a pile of remotes on your coffee table, and spend more time trying to figure out which one to use rather than watching your favorite TV shows? Do you often struggle to control your cable box, DVD player, sound system, or streaming device separately, leading to confusion and frustration? Then it’s time to unlock the magic of your TV with a universal remote!\nA universal remote is a single device that can control multiple devices in your home entertainment system. It eliminates the need for several remotes and simplifies your viewing experience. With a universal remote, you can switch between cable and streaming, adjust the volume, turn the TV on and off, and even set up custom commands with just one click of a button.\nTo help you navigate the world of universal remotes, we have compiled a comprehensive guide that covers everything you need to know about these devices, including their types, features, compatibility, programming, and troubleshooting. So, let’s get started!\nTypes of Universal Remotes There are generally two types of universal remotes: basic and advanced. Basic universal remotes are usually inexpensive and require users to input the codes manually to program each device. These remotes are typically easy to use and support basic functions such as volume, channel, power, and input switching.\nAdvanced universal remotes, also called smart remotes, are more sophisticated and offer advanced features such as voice control, touch screens, macro commands, and smartphone integration. These remotes can control multiple devices simultaneously using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity, and can be programmed using an app or software.\nFeatures to Look For When choosing a universal remote, consider the following features:\nDevice compatibility: Ensure that the remote is compatible with your devices or has the capability to learn and store the commands of your existing remotes. Number of devices: Determine how many devices you need to control and choose a remote that can accommodate them. Ease of use: Look for a remote with an intuitive interface, clear buttons, and ergonomic design that fits comfortably in your hand. Customization: Consider a remote that allows you to customize buttons, create macros, and program favorite channels or apps. Voice control: If you prefer hands-free operation, choose a remote with voice control capabilities. App integration: Some remotes allow you to control them using an app on your smartphone or tablet. How to Program a Universal Remote Programming a universal remote is a straightforward process that varies depending on the type and brand of the remote. Basic remotes usually require the input of codes that correspond to each device, while advanced remotes use an app or software to scan, detect, and program the devices automatically.\nTo program a universal remote, follow these general steps:\nTurn on the device you want to program and place it in the line of sight of the remote. Press and hold the device button on the remote (e.g., TV) until it blinks. Enter the code or use the app to detect and program the device. Test the remote to ensure that it controls the device correctly. Repeat the process for other devices. Troubleshooting Tips If your universal remote is not working correctly or is acting up, try these troubleshooting tips:\nCheck the batteries and replace them if necessary. Ensure that the remote is aimed at the device and is within range. Reset the remote by removing the batteries, waiting for a few seconds, and reinserting them. Try reprogramming the remote and ensure that the correct code is used. Contact the manufacturer or customer support for further assistance. In conclusion, a universal remote is an essential tool for simplifying your home entertainment system and enhancing your viewing experience. By choosing the right type and features, programming it correctly, and troubleshooting any issues, you can unlock the magic of your TV and never struggle with multiple remotes again!\nPlenty of home theater and entertainment devices come with a remote control. Usually, the remote can only operate one device. Some TV remote controls can control other devices within the same brand. For example, most LG, Samsung, and Sony TV remotes can control Blu-ray Disc players of the same brand.\nHowever, most people want one remote control that operates all of their devices, regardless of brand. That’s what a universal remote control is for.\nWhat Is a Universal Remote Control? A universal remote control operates basic and, in some cases, advanced features of home entertainment devices from several product brands.\nThe types of devices that a universal remote can control include TVs, CD/DVD/Blu-ray Disc players, home theater receivers, soundbars, cable and satellite boxes, video game consoles, and streaming devices, such as Roku and Apple TV.\nAdditionally, most universal remotes require you to press buttons. However, some feature a touchscreen, like on a smartphone. A growing number of universal remotes provide access to and control of smart TV features.\nAlthough the word universal implies that this type of remote controls everything, in reality, each remote has different levels of universal control.\nRemote Control Programming Options For a universal remote to operate different brands and device models, it needs to be programmed to recognize the device it will control. Universal remotes incorporate one or more of the following programming features:\nPre-programmed (also called multi-brand): These remotes can be used with a limited number of devices from select product brands without further programming. Learning: The remote learns the remote control commands of other remotes by pointing a universal remote and a dedicated device remote at each other and programming each command one-at-a-time. Programmable with a code: Program the remote control by entering a special code designated for specific brands and devices or by connecting the remote to a PC via USB and inputting the code from a special website. Programmable without a code: Most programmable remotes include a feature that scans for a code via a series of steps outlined in the user guide, without the need to enter the code. How Universal Remote Controls Work In addition to programming, a universal remote control needs to communicate commands to a target device. This can be done using one or more of the following methods:\nIR: This is a common method that remotes use to control devices. Each time you touch a button on the remote, it sends a series of infrared light pulses to a sensor located on the front of the TV or other device. The device executes the command. This requires a clear line-of-sight between the remote and the device. If that isn’t possible, place accessories such as an IR repeater or IR extender between the remote and the target device, retransmitting the pulses using its IR beam or electrically via a cable connected to an IR sensor input connection. RF: As a solution to the line-of-sight limitation, some universal remotes incorporate an RF (radio frequency) transmitter. This allows you to control devices that are placed inside cabinets or otherwise obstructed. Not many controllable devices have RF receivers that can be used with an RF remote. One solution is to transmit the RF commands to an external RF receiver, with the receiver resending the signal in infrared from the receiver to the device. For additional flexibility, many RF remotes incorporate an infrared option. Wi-Fi: If a universal remote control incorporates Wi-Fi, you can control some smart devices through a home network. Using a variety of apps, this type of remote can control both device functions and content access, such as streaming audio and video. This feature is commonly available with smartphones in conjunction with Wi-Fi supported TVs, home theater receivers, or hubs that receive Wi-Fi signals and relay the command information via IR to the device. However, some handheld remotes can be used with an external control hub to relay commands from the remote through infrared, RF, and Wi-Fi. Bluetooth: Some universal remotes incorporate control via Bluetooth. This is an option for controlling Roku streaming devices and some video game consoles. This means that some universal remotes can use Bluetooth for controlling some devices and IR or RF to control other devices. Types of Universal Remote Control Commands All universal remote controls can perform simple tasks, such as raising and lowering the volume, changing channels, and selecting inputs. Some advanced remotes offer control of sound, picture, and device settings.\nSome remote controls can also perform groups of tasks (referred to as macros or activities). For example, you may be able to execute a task with one button push or touchscreen press, such as turning on the TV, selecting the input for a DVD or Blu-ray Disc player, and playing the disc loaded in the player automatically.\nA more complex activity or macro task might be to turn on the TV, select the input that a home theater receiver is connected to, turn on a home theater receiver, turn on a specific source connected to the receiver, start the source playback, lower the room lights, and adjust the thermostat. All of this accomplished by the push of a single button or icon on a touchscreen.\nAlternatives to Universal Remotes A universal remote is a common way to get rid of remote control clutter. Still, some alternatives can enhance or limit the need for a handheld universal remote.\nThe Bottom Line A good universal remote control can make your home entertainment setup easier to use, but it isn’t always a complete replacement for the original. Some universal remotes may only control some basic functions, while others provide access to advanced picture and sound adjustments, as well as other features.\nNever toss out your original remotes. While you may not use a remote for months at a time, you may need to access functions that the universal remote cannot manage. Having the original remote also comes in handy if you sell your equipment.\nBefore you purchase a universal remote control, consider the following:\nHow many devices you need to control.How many programming options you need to access.How extensive the control options are.
