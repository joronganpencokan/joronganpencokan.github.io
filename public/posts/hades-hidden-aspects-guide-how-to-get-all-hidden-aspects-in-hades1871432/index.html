Unlock All of Hades’ Best Kept Secrets with our Hidden Aspects Guide\nIf you’re a fan of Hades, the critically acclaimed action-packed rogue-like game from Supergiant Games, then you know that there are many challenges to overcome in your journey through the underworld. From facing the wrath of the gods to navigating the different levels of hell, you need all the help you can get.\nThat’s where our Hidden Aspects Guide comes in. We’ve scoured every corner of the game and discovered some of the best-kept secrets that will help you progress through the game with ease.\nSo, what are Hidden Aspects, you may ask?\nHidden Aspects are alternate versions of the different weapons in Hades that come with unique perks that can help you unlock new aspects of the game. They are powerful tools that give you an edge in combat and make your journey through the underworld much more manageable.\nEach of the six weapons in Hades has its own unique Hidden Aspect that can be unlocked by following specific criteria. Some of these weapons can only be unlocked through the use of a special item, while others require you to complete various challenges or achievements.\nOne of the most significant advantages of using Hidden Aspects in Hades is the ability to level up your characters faster. As you progress, you will earn more darkness, which can be used to upgrade your abilities and unlock new weapons, but this can be a slow process. Hidden Aspects, on the other hand, provide extra darkness, allowing you to level up your characters quickly and easily.\nTo help you unleash the power of Hidden Aspects in Hades, we have put together a comprehensive guide covering all the essential aspects of each weapon. Our guide includes everything from hidden aspect details to strategies that will help you take down even the toughest bosses.\nWhether you’re new to Hades or a seasoned pro, our Hidden Aspects guide will help you unlock all of the game’s secrets and take down any challenges that come your way. From slaying the gods to escaping the underworld, we’ve got you covered.\nSo, what are you waiting for? Unleash the power within and unlock all of Hades’ best-kept secrets with our Hidden Aspects Guide. Good luck!\nHades is undoubtedly one of the fastest-growing roguelike action role-playing video games right now. There are certain reasons behind its rapid growth, and one of them is its weapons system. There are multiple weapons in Hades and each requires a unique playstyle and has the potential to change the pace and difficulty of the game.\nHowever, if weapons were not enough variety, each of them has three Aspects and then one hidden aspect, known as Legendary Aspects. For uninitiated, you need some elbow grease to unlock the Legendary Aspects.\nAlso Read | Hades Keepsakes Guide: Who To Give Nectar To In Hades\nIf you are unable to get the dialogue, perform a few runs because unlocking the weapon could be hidden behind additional others in a queue.\nIf you are looking for a guide on how to unlock all hidden Aspects in Hades then you have come to the right place. Also Read | How Long Hades Takes To Defeat – Answered\nHow to Unlock All Hidden Aspects in Hades In order to unlock Hidden Aspects in Hidde, you will have to shell out five Titan Bloon into a weapon and then taking to someone who knows everything about the legendary story. The most important one is the Aspect of Guan Yu, which may help you to unlock other Legendary Aspects. If you could not get the desired Aspect, then you will have to unlock the Aspect of Guan Yu first .\nHere’s a list of All Hidden Aspects in Hades:\nSword – Aspect of Arthur: Once you have managed to unlock the Aspect of Guan Yu, invest five Titan’s Bloot and talk to Nyx. Spear – Aspect of Guan Yu: After accumulating a couple of Hidden Asepcts, talk to Achilles. Shield – Aspect of Beowulf: After Investing five Titan’s Blood into Shields, talk to Chaos. Bow – Aspect of Rama: After Investing five Titan’s Blood into Bows, talk to Artemis. Fist – Aspect of Gilgamesh: After Investing five Titan’s Blood into Fists, talk to Asterius whenever you found him alone. In order to do this, you will have to search for a skull icon on the chamber rewards in Elysium. Asterius is said to be a miniboss encounter, but this method is not guaranteed to give you a fight with him. Gun – Aspect of Lucifer: After Investing five Titan’s Blood into Guns, talk to Zeus. It is likely that you will have to struggle a lot to find this dialogue because many of them require random events and gods! We will recommend using the god’s keepsakes to meet them but using the same for Choas and Asterius is not advisable, because they require luck or purchasing specific things from Charan pools.\nThat’s all you need to know about how to unlock all hidden aspects in Hades.\n","wordCount":"850","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-07T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-07T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Clyde Niles"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/hades-hidden-aspects-guide-how-to-get-all-hidden-aspects-in-hades1871432/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unleash The Power Within!
