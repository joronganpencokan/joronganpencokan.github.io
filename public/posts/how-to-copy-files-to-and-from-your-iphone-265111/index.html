Do you find it tedious and time-consuming? If yes, then this article is for you. In this guide, we will teach you how to effortlessly transfer files between your iPhone and computer.\nTransfer Files from iPhone to Computer\nUse iCloud: iCloud is Apple’s cloud storage that allows you to store your files and access them from any of your Apple devices. To transfer files from your iPhone to computer using iCloud, follow these steps: Make sure you are signed in to your iCloud account on both your iPhone and computer. On your iPhone, go to Settings and tap on your name at the top. Tap on iCloud and make sure that the app you want to transfer files from is turned on. On your computer, open a web browser and go to icloud.com. Sign in to your iCloud account and click on the app you want to transfer files from. Select the files you want to transfer and click on the Download button. Use AirDrop: AirDrop is a built-in feature on your iPhone and Mac that allows you to transfer files wirelessly. To transfer files from your iPhone to Mac using AirDrop, follow these steps: Make sure both your iPhone and Mac are turned on and have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on. On your iPhone, go to the app that contains the file you want to transfer and select the file. Tap on the Share icon and select your Mac from the list of available devices. On your Mac, click on Accept to receive the file. Transfer Files from Computer to iPhone\nUse iTunes: iTunes is a media player and library that also allows you to sync your iPhone with your computer. To transfer files from your computer to iPhone using iTunes, follow these steps: Connect your iPhone to your computer using a USB cable. Open iTunes and select your iPhone from the list of available devices. Click on the File Sharing tab and select the app you want to transfer files to. Click on Add File, select the file you want to transfer, and click on Open. Click on Sync to transfer the file to your iPhone. Use iCloud: You can also use iCloud to transfer files from your computer to iPhone. To transfer files from computer to iPhone using iCloud, follow these steps: Make sure you are signed in to your iCloud account on both your computer and iPhone. On your computer, open a web browser and go to icloud.com. Sign in to your iCloud account and click on the app you want to transfer files to. Click on the Upload button and select the file you want to transfer. On your iPhone, go to the app that corresponds to the file you just uploaded and your file will be available for download. Conclusion\nTransferring files between your iPhone and computer can be a hassle, but with iCloud, AirDrop, and iTunes, it can be done effortlessly. Whether you want to transfer files from your iPhone to computer or from computer to iPhone, these methods will make the process quick and easy. So, unlock the secret and start transferring files between your iPhone and computer like a pro!\nTransferring files directly to your iPhone is something of a lost art. It used to be that the iPhone was extremely restrictive about the files it could store, but Apple has loosened their policies over time. Today a variety of files can be transferred through iTunes, synced via iCloud and Dropbox, or shared through AirDrop. But if none of those methods will quite cut it for you, there are other options.\nTransferring Files Wirelessly with AirDroid AirDroid, despite the name, works on iPhones, iPads, Macs and Windows PCs. You can use it to access your files, but not in the total-freedom way of a USB. You’ll still have some restrictions in place, but it’s far more controllable than random background file sync controls.\nDownload AirDroid on your iPhone from the App Store.\nCreate a user account by clicking “Sign Up” at the bottom of the tutorial screen.\nOnce logged in, tap on the “My devices” tab at the top of the app’s window.\nTap on the info bubble next to AirDroid Web.\nMake sure your computer is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your iPhone.\nOpen a web browser on your computer and navigate to the address provided in step 2 of Airdrop’s on-screen instructions. It will look something like “192.168.0.102:8888” or “10.0.0.3:8888.”\nTap to accept the incoming connection request on your iPhone.\nYou’ll now have access to the AirDroid web interface on your computer. From here you can transfer files to your phone.\nTransfer Files to iPhone To upload a generic file to AirDroid, click on the “Files” icon on the AirDroid Web desktop.\nClick on the “Upload” icon to select a file to upload.\nYou’ll see the same file appear within AirDroid. If you don’t see it, tap on “AirDroid” web on your iPhone.\nThese files are stuck within AirDroid’s sandbox: iOS restricts the app from saving files directly to your iPhone. If you need to have an editable file on your device, you should use built-in tools like iCloud or Dropbox.\nTransferring Photos and Videos to iPhone To transfer a photo or video, click the “Photos” or “Videos” icon on the AirDroid Web desktop.\nClick the “Upload” button and select a photo or video to upload.\nAs before, the file will appear in AirDroid. It will also automatically download to your photo library on your iPhone.\nTransferring Photos and Videos to Your Computer The transfer also works in the opposite direction. Just like AirDroid enables you to transfer files from your computer to your iPhone, you can also transfer files from your iPhone to your computer.\nClick on “Photos” or “Videos” in the AirDroid Web desktop.\nTo download one image, click on the download icon at the bottom of the thumbnail.\nTo download multiple images, tick the checkboxes on the thumbnails and click the “Download” button. This will download a ZIP file containing all the selected files.\nTransferring with a Wired Connection If you want to use a wired connection to transfer files, your best bet is to use iTunes. By default, iTunes supports files based on the applications installed on your device. We can install an application that allows us to transfer any type of file.\nDownload File Manager \u0026 Browser from the iOS App Store.\nConnect your iPhone to your computer via a USB cable.\nOpen iTunes and click on the phone icon at the top of the screen.\nClick on “File Sharing” in the sidebar.\nClick on the File Manager icon. This is where we’ll be moving files through.\nClick on the “Add…” button and select files to transfer to your iPhone.\nOpen the File Manager app on your iPhone to view the files.\nTo move files from the iPhone to your computer, click on the “+” button at the top of the File Manager app window.\nSelect the file in your iTunes window and click “Save…” to download the file.\nAgain, these files can’t really be moved outside of the app’s sandbox. You’ll need to use something like iCloud or Dropbox to make that happen.\nConclusion Both apps will work on macOS and Windows. But, unfortunately, it doesn’t offer the flexibility of a USB drive. iOS protects users by sandboxing apps, and you can’t overcome that without hacking the device. But either app above will provide more flexibility than built-in tools. You should also explore the free tier of iCloud and Dropbox which are both more tightly integrated with iOS and work through the Files app on your iPhone.\nImage credit: iPhone 8 Space Gray connected to laptop on table by Africa Studio/Shutterstock\nAlexander Fox is a tech and science writer based in Philadelphia, PA with one cat, three Macs and more USB cables than he could ever use.\nOur latest tutorials delivered straight to your inbox\n","wordCount":"1391","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-03-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-03-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jose Strain"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-copy-files-to-and-from-your-iphone-265111/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock the Secret: Learn How to Effortlessly Transfer Files Between Your iPhone and Computer!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-03-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 9, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1391 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jose Strain</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#transferring-files-wirelessly-with-airdroid>Transferring Files Wirelessly with AirDroid</a></li><li><a href=#transfer-files-to-iphone>Transfer Files to iPhone</a></li><li><a href=#transferring-photos-and-videos-to-iphone>Transferring Photos and Videos to iPhone</a></li><li><a href=#transferring-photos-and-videos-to-your-computer>Transferring Photos and Videos to Your Computer</a></li><li><a href=#transferring-with-a-wired-connection>Transferring with a Wired Connection</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>+++
