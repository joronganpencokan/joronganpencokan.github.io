In the address bar of your browser, type gif in the URL just before youtube in the address and then press Enter. The video will open up in the gifs.com video editor, and there will be a pink slider on the timeline under the GIF that you can move around to Pick Start Time for the video. When you find the place you want to start, click it. Once you’ve picked the start time, the timeline expands, and a short section of it is highlighted in blue. This is the suggested length of the GIF you are creating. You can grab and move either side of the blue box (shaded in a darker blue) to change the start and end times.

You&rsquo;ll find both downloadable GIF creators and websites that will let you create a GIF using YouTube or any other videos. Many of them are free, and some are just as easy to use as these two examples.</p><p>In order to use Giphy to create a GIF, you&rsquo;ll need to sign up for an account. It&rsquo;s free, but they do request your name and email address.</p><p>Start by finding the YouTube video you want to use to create a GIF.</p><p>Copy the URL for the video and paste it into Giphy&rsquo;s GIF Maker.</p><p>For Giphy to work properly, the length of the original video you&rsquo;re using to create a GIF must be less than 15 minutes long.</p><p>A new screen will automatically appear that allows you to set the duration and start time of your GIF. After you set the duration and start time, click Continue to Decorate.</p><p>On the next screen, you have options for Caption, Stickers, Filters, and Draw. Each of those tabs has additional options that you can use to make the GIF unique. When you&rsquo;ve finished decorating it, click Continue to Upload.</p><p>When the Add Info screen appears, you can change the Source URL if it&rsquo;s different than the one you entered to get started and Add Tags if you want to make the GIF easily searchable by others. There is also the option to make the GIF Public. This is On by default, but if you don&rsquo;t want it to be public, you can click to turn it Off. When you&rsquo;re finished, click Upload to GIPHY.</p><p>Once the file is done uploaded, you&rsquo;ll be taken the final GIF. On the right side of the screen, you&rsquo;ll find all the options for sharing it and your GIF will be included in Giphy&rsquo;s search (if you made it public) for others to find.</p><p>Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/hitman-3-how-to-use-remote-explosives-easy-steps406210/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Blow Your Mind: Master the Art of Remote Explosives with These Simple Steps in Hitman 3!</span></a>
