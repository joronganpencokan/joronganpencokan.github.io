If you’re a Mac user, you might be wondering how you can make the most out of your computer. Sure, you might be familiar with the basics such as browsing the internet or sending emails, but there’s so much more you can do with your Mac. One of the most powerful tools you have at your disposal is the macOS Calendar.\nThe macOS Calendar is a simple but powerful tool that can help you organize your schedule, set reminders, and keep track of important events. It’s an essential app for anyone looking to manage their time effectively, whether it’s for work, school or personal projects. In this guide, we’ll take you through everything you need to know to master the macOS Calendar and unlock its hidden powers.\nGetting Started with the macOS Calendar Before we dive into the advanced features of the macOS Calendar, let’s start with the basics. To open the app, click on the Calendar icon in your Dock, or search for it in Spotlight (Cmd + Space). By default, the Calendar will show you the current month, but you can change the view by clicking on the drop-down menu in the top left corner.\nTo add an event, click on the “+” icon in the top left corner, or simply double-click on the day you want to schedule the event for. You can then enter the details of the event, such as the title, date, time, location, and any notes you want to add. You can also set a reminder for the event, by choosing a specific time or setting it to remind you a certain number of hours or days ahead.\nSyncing Your Calendar Across Devices One of the best features of the macOS Calendar is that you can sync it across all your Apple devices. This means you can access the same calendar from your iPhone, iPad, and even Apple Watch. To enable syncing, go to System Preferences \u003e Apple ID \u003e iCloud, and make sure the “Calendars” option is checked.\nOnce you’ve enabled syncing, any events you add to your macOS Calendar will automatically show up on your other devices, and vice versa. This makes it easy to stay up-to-date with your schedule, no matter where you are.\nAdvanced Features of the macOS Calendar Now that you’re familiar with the basics of the macOS Calendar, let’s explore some of its more advanced features.\nCreating Multiple Calendars Did you know that you can create multiple calendars within the macOS Calendar app? This is useful if you want to keep your personal and work schedules separate, or if you have different projects or events that you want to keep track of.\nTo create a new calendar, click on “File” in the top menu bar, then select “New Calendar”. You can then give the calendar a name and choose a colour to help you distinguish it from your other calendars. You can also choose to share the calendar with others, or keep it private.\nCustomizing Your View The default view of the macOS Calendar is a monthly view, but you can also switch to a weekly, daily or even yearly view. To change the view, simply click on the drop-down menu in the top left corner and select the view you want.\nYou can also customize the view by showing or hiding certain calendars, or by changing the colour of the events. To do this, click on “View” in the menu bar, then select “Show/Hide Calendars” or “Calendar Colors”.\nUsing Key Shortcuts Did you know that the macOS Calendar has several key shortcuts that can save you time and make using the app even easier? Here are a few of the most useful shortcuts:\nCmd + N: Add a new event Cmd + T: Show today’s date Spacebar: Preview an event Shift + Cmd + D: Add a new calendar Cmd + R: Refresh your calendars Integrating with Other Apps Finally, the macOS Calendar can integrate with other apps and services, such as Mail, Contacts, and even Siri. For example, you can create an event by simply dictating to Siri, or add an email to your calendar by dragging and dropping it into the app.\nTo enable these integrations, go to System Preferences \u003e Internet Accounts, and add your accounts for Mail, Contacts, and Calendar. You can also enable Siri by going to System Preferences \u003e Siri.\nConclusion The macOS Calendar is a powerful tool that can help you manage your time and stay on top of your schedule. With its advanced features and integrations, you can customize the app to suit your needs and make it even more effective. Whether you’re a student, a freelancer, or a busy professional, mastering the macOS Calendar can help you unlock your hidden powers and achieve your goals.\nWhether you are looking to organize your life or want reminders of upcoming birthdays, macOS calendar can do it all. Calendars are so much more than just a place to create events. Let’s take a deep look at all the things you didn’t know your Mac calendar could do.\nAdding a Calendar The Calendar app can host almost as many personal and work calendars as you can imagine. Adding a new calendar is easy.\nLaunch the Calendar app on your Mac. You can launch it from the dock or from Launchpad.\nClick on File from the menu bar near the top of the screen and select “New Calendar.”\nNext, type in whatever name you would like as a title.\nHit Enter and you have a new calendar.\nAdding Accounts In the Calendar app, choose “Calendar” in the menu bar and “Add Account.”\nYou now have the option of selecting what type of calendar you wish to add. It can be anything from iCloud, Microsoft Exchange, Google, Yahoo, AOL or a manually-entered option.\nEach account will become listed on the Calendar sidebar. If the sidebar is not showing, select “View” and “Show Calendar List.”\nAdding Events Open the Calendar app, right-click on the date and type in a name for the event. This can be anything you want from a birthday, a dinner or a meeting with the boss.\nAdjust the hours, minutes and AM/PM to make sure you have the appropriate start and end time.\nIf the event will repeat or is recurring, you can select “Every Day,” “Every Week,” etc., or enter a custom option.\nYou also have the option of adding an alarm if you want a notification ahead of the scheduled time. This can range from five minutes to two days before or any custom timeframe you would like.\nThere is even an option to set up a travel time so you know when to leave for an event if it’s not in your home or at your place of work.\nAdd Multi-Day Events In the Month view, click on the first day of an upcoming event and drag the cursor all the way to the last day of the event. The Calendar app will automatically schedule the app for multiple days as all-day events.\nIn the Week view, you can drag the event across the “all-day” section at the top. If you click and drag across the days in the “all-day” section, the event will now get scheduled between the first and last day you have selected.\nAdd Events from macOS Mail Begin by opening up the Mail app on your Mac and selecting “Preferences -\u003e General -\u003e Add invitations to your Calendar automatically.”\nOnce this setting is enabled, you need only to hover over a date or time in an email to see an option to add it to the Calendar app.\nOnly upcoming events can be scheduled, as the Mail app will not let you add historical events, even if they are as recent as the day before.\nCreate or Modify New Calendar Events with Siri Siri offers a number of opportunities within the macOS calendar, as it syncs to your iPhone with iCloud, Exchange, Google, etc.\nYou can ask Siri for a summary of upcoming calendar events. Just say “Hey Siri, show me upcoming calendar events.”\nTo add a calendar event, say “Hey Siri, schedule a call with Mom tomorrow at 10 am.” Remember to replace the names and dates with your own information.\nOpen Files Before a Meeting What happens if you have a recurring weekly meeting or a spreadsheet you need to update for a client every month?\nTo get started, create an event and then double-click on it so you see the “Edit Event” pop-up menu open.\nOnce the pop-up opens, click on “Alert -\u003e Customer” so you see another small pop-up appear.\nClick on “Message with sound” so you can see the drop-down menu and the option for “Open file.”\nClick on the Calendar drop-down menu right beneath “Open file” and select “Other.”\nThis will bring up the Finder window where you can select the file you want to open each day/week/month.\nA “+” button appears next to the first alert so you can create multiple alerts and/or multiple files opening each month.\nHow to Use Multitouch Like plenty of other Mac apps, multitouch comes in handy for the Calendar app as well.\nSwipe up or down with two fingers on the mousepad to move between different months when you are in month view.\nIf you are in week view, swipe right or left and jump between different weeks.\nGo into the Day view, and from the left side of the mousepad, swipe left or right and move between different days.\nAccess Your Calendar from iCloud.com In the event you need to access your calendar and you do not have your phone or computer, you can log in to iCloud.com and see your entire calendar.\nUsing any browser, go to iCloud.com and log in using your Apple or iCloud ID.\nNote that in order for this to work, you need to be using iCloud sync for all of your calendar items to appear on the Web.\nOnce you open iCloud.com, click on the Calendar icon, and you will see your entire calendar.\nIf you are not using iCloud sync, go “Settings -\u003e iCloud” on your Mac and make sure the Calendar box is checked off to enable syncing. Apple’s Calendar app has long been a staple for millions of Mac users. Using these tips will allow you to master your Calendar and stay productive. If you don’t like the default Calendar app, there are plenty of excellent third-party Calendar apps around.\nDavid is a freelance tech writer with over 15 years of experience in the tech industry.
