As our days become increasingly busy, the number of email accounts we use has also risen. We seem to have one for work, another for entertainment, one for online shopping, and even one for our side hustles. As such, it’s not uncommon to experience a backlog of unread emails or struggle to find important messages in a sea of spam.\nFortunately, Zoho Mail can help you conquer this issue. With its all-in-one email management features, you can easily organize your inboxes and stay on top of your emails without going insane.\nFirst Things First: What Is Zoho Mail? Zoho Mail is a cloud-based email hosting solution for businesses and individuals looking to manage multiple email accounts easily. It comes with a comprehensive set of features that make email management a breeze, including inbox customization, email filtering, and email aliases.\nSome of the top benefits of using Zoho Mail include:\nUncluttered inbox management 5GB mailbox storage space Advanced security features Mobile app functionality And more! Take Control of Your Email Accounts With Zoho Mail, you won’t have to sign in and out of multiple email accounts anymore. The platform integrates all your email addresses, allowing you to access them from one central location.\nTo add an email account, head to the “Settings” tab on your dashboard and click on “Add User Email Address.” From there, enter your details in the required fields and click “Add.” Once you’ve done this, you can toggle between your inbox and the various email accounts you’ve added.\nBut that’s not all. Zoho Mail lets you customize the appearance of each inbox, so you can quickly differentiate between them. You can adjust the color scheme, layout, and even add subfolders to keep everything organized.\nStay on Top of Your Emails with Zoho Mail’s Filtering Features Another significant perk of Zoho Mail is its filtering capabilities. The platform allows you to create customized filters to ensure that critical emails don’t get lost in the flurry of messages flooding your inbox.\nFor instance, you can set up a filter to send all emails containing the word “urgent” directly to your primary inbox. Or, you can create filters based on the sender’s name, subject line, or content. Additionally, you can use Zoho Mail’s “Sweep” feature to archive emails that you’ve read but don’t want to delete entirely.\nUsing Email Aliases Email aliases are email addresses that represent a single mailbox but in different forms. For example, let’s say your primary email address is johndoe@gmail.com. You could create an email alias that reads johndoe+homedecor@gmail.com or johndoe+sales@gmail.com.\nThis feature is particularly useful when signing up for newsletters, creating online accounts, or registering for a service or product trial. Email aliases prevent spammers from exploiting your primary email address by using disposable email addresses.\nConclusion Even with multiple email accounts, Zoho Mail simplifies email management. From customizable inboxes, filtering features, and email aliases, you’ll stay on top of your emails and never miss an important message. Say goodbye to inbox overload and try Zoho Mail today!\nWith Email service providers growing at a rapid pace, it is very common for anyone to have several email accounts. While it is easy to start an account, managing all the accounts can become a chaotic task and at worst, it can take hell a lot of time and effort.\nThe question is: Is there any application that allows you to manage multiple email accounts? In desktop, Zimbra answers this question. For Web-based application that is independent of any application or platform. Zoho mail seems to be a great choice.\nIn this tutorial, I would like to demonstrate how you can manage multiple email accounts (in this case, Gmail, Yahoo and Live) with Zoho mail.\nSteps to Manage Multiple Email accounts with Zoho Mail Sign up for Zoho mail account or sign in with your Gmail or Yahoo ID.\nOnce you login to your Zoho mail, Go to “Settings -\u003e Common Settings -\u003e My Preference” and add your other email accounts.\nAfter adding your Yahoo or Gmail email addresses, Zoho will sent you a verification ID of which you have to enter to finalize the email settings.\nRepeat the above step to add as many mail accounts as you want. The following image shows the result after adding all the mail accounts\nNow sign in to your respective emails individually which are all added in Zoho account to enable Mail forwarding options\nGmail allows you to configure all incoming mails to forward another email address, yet keep a copy of the original in the inbox\nFor Yahoo, the forwarding option is available only to the old users. New user will have to upgrade to the premium account to enjoy the forwarding service.\nSimilar to Yahoo mail, Live mail also have limitations in their forwarding options.\nOnce you have set up the mail forward options in all the Email accounts, you can now use the “Filters” and “Folders” options in Zoho mail to segregate the mails when they arrive at the inbox. In the home page of Zoho mail, add folders like Yahoo, Gmail or any other name that you fancy.\nOnce you have added the folders, go to “Settings -\u003e Personalize mail options -\u003e Filters”. Add filters separately for Yahoo, Gmail and Live mail. Enter the Filter name and fill the criteria as “to” contains “yourname@yahoo.com” and perform move to the specific folder.\nWhen composing/replying a mail, you can easily switch between the various accounts so other won’t know that you are sending from Zoho mail. Conclusion You might have plenty of email accounts, each set up for different purposes: personal, groups, newsletter, work and so on. What Zoho mail does and allows you to do is to become a hub for you to maintain all the email accounts. Other benefits include the offline mail option with Google Gears and the eye catching cool Zoho mail experience with a short mail alias “name@zoho.com”.\nFor those who are using Gmail to micromanage their multiple emails, you can try out Zoho mail and feel the differences.
