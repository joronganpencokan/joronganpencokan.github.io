Are you ready to become a true master of the grape? Then it’s time to dig into Hitman 3’s Tour mission and uncover the top secrets to crush it!\nIn this mission, you’ll play as Agent 47 on a mission to infiltrate a vineyard and target Carl Ingram, one of the Providence partners. Your goal is to eliminate Ingram and his bodyguard, Marcus Stuyvesant, in order to complete the mission.\nHowever, this won’t be easy. The vineyard is heavily guarded, and there are numerous challenges and obstacles you’ll need to overcome if you want to succeed. But fear not, because we’ve got the inside scoop on some of the best strategies and tactics to help you crush the Tour mission and emerge victorious!\nSecret #1: Disguise Yourself as a Tour Guide One of the best ways to gain access to restricted areas in the vineyard is by disguising yourself as a tour guide. You can do this by locating a tour guide uniform and putting it on. Once you’re in disguise, you’ll be able to lead tours around the vineyard and gain access to a variety of areas that would otherwise be off-limits.\nSecret #2: Use Poison to Eliminate Targets Poison can be a highly effective tool for eliminating your targets without attracting attention. You can use poison to taint glasses of wine, which the targets will then consume and become sick or die. To obtain poison, you can either locate it in the vineyard or craft it yourself using various ingredients.\nSecret #3: Take Advantage of Environmental Hazards The vineyard is filled with dangerous environmental hazards that you can use to your advantage. For example, you can cause crates of grapes to fall on your targets or make use of the heavy machinery in the vineyard to kill them. Just be sure to be sneaky and avoid drawing attention to yourself.\nSecret #4: Learn the Layout of the Vineyard Knowing the layout of the vineyard is crucial if you want to succeed. Take the time to explore the various areas and familiarize yourself with the different routes you can take. This will allow you to plan your attacks and avoid getting caught in sticky situations.\nSecret #5: Use Your Instincts Finally, don’t forget to use your instincts! This ability allows you to see through walls and determine the positions and movements of nearby guards and targets. By using your instincts, you can avoid getting caught and execute your plan with precision.\nSo there you have it, the top secrets to crushing the Tour mission in Hitman 3. With these tips and tactics in mind, you’ll be well on your way to unleashing your inner Grapemaster and emerging victorious!\nIn The Tour mission in Hitman 3, you will be infiltrating a wine factory tour. During this objective, you will have to harvest grapes wearing a disguise. If you are confused about how to go about this part of the mission, this guide on how to harvest grapes in Hitman 3 will help you out. Check out how to harvest three ripe Malbec grapevines right here.\nHow to Harvest Grapes in Hitman 3? After getting into the building, you will have to follow Corvo Black undetected and when you find the right moment, go ahead and subdue him. Do this when you reach an area where he’s alone and near some purple flowers. Don’t forget to hide his body in those flowers as well and steal his disguise.\nDressed as Corvo Black, talk to the receptionist and then make your way downstairs via the staircase that is very nearby. After that, talk to Diana and then your goal will be to find the tour guide. When you do that, you will hear that he asks a worker to pick three ripe Malbec grapevines. One worker will walk away to do that but you have to intervene and do it yourself.\nHere’s how to harvest three ripe Malbec grapevines:\nFollow the winery worker and subdue him at the perfect spot where there’s a yellow container. That’s where you can drop his body and take his winery worker disguise.\nWith that done, you have to head to the shed and get the grape knife that will help you harvest grapes but stay undetected. Sneak into the location by jumping over the rails and go back to the grapevines without anyone seeing you.\nNow the trick is to walk towards those grapes that don’t have workers near them because they will see through your disguise. It gets tougher if you are playing on a higher difficulty so tread carefully.\nSimply interact with the grapes for picking them. Do this three times and then go to the tour guide to give them to him.\nThat’s basically how to harvest grapes in Hitman 3. The key is to switch from Corvo Black’s disguise to the winery worker’s disguise and grabbing the knife that will help you harvest three ripe Malbec grapevines.\nIf you need more help with other Hitman 3 guides and challenges, we’re covering all of it on Gamer Tweak.\n","wordCount":"858","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-03-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-03-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Florence Feliciano"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/hitman-3-how-to-harvest-grapes-the-tour-mission-guide649005/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unleash Your Inner Grapemaster: Hitman 3's Top Secrets to Crush the Tour Mission!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-03-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 9, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;858 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Florence Feliciano</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#how-to-harvest-grapes-in-hitman-3>How to Harvest Grapes in Hitman 3?</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=unleash-your-inner-grapemaster-hitman-3s-top-secrets-to-crush-the-tour-mission>Unleash Your Inner Grapemaster: Hitman 3&rsquo;s Top Secrets to Crush the Tour Mission!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#unleash-your-inner-grapemaster-hitman-3s-top-secrets-to-crush-the-tour-mission>#</a></h1><p>Are you ready to become a true master of the grape?
