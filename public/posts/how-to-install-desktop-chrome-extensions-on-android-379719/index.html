Android devices, in particular, have incredible features that make them one of the most popular mobile operating systems in the world. However, despite all their impressive capabilities, accessing certain desktop features on Android devices can still be a challenge. Fortunately, there is one simple trick that can help you unlock the secret to accessing desktop features on your Android device.\nThe trick involves using a third-party app called Nova Launcher. Nova Launcher is a customizable launcher app that replaces your standard home screen with one that you can fully customize according to your preferences. With Nova Launcher, you can access features that were previously only available on desktop computers.\nHere are some of the key features of Nova Launcher that can help you access desktop features on your Android device:\nCustomizable home screen: With Nova Launcher, you can fully customize your home screen to make it look and function the way you want it to. You can choose from a variety of widgets and icons, and even add custom gestures to launch specific apps or actions.\nApp drawer customization: Nova Launcher also allows you to customize your app drawer, making it easier to find and access your favorite apps. You can group apps by category, change the layout of your app drawer, and even hide apps that you don’t use often.\nNotification badges: Nova Launcher also supports notification badges, which are small icons that appear on app icons to indicate that you have a new notification. This feature makes it easier to keep track of important notifications without having to constantly check each individual app.\nGesture controls: Another powerful feature of Nova Launcher is its support for gesture controls. With gesture controls, you can perform specific actions by swiping or tapping on your screen in specific ways. For example, you can assign a gesture to launch your camera app, or swipe up on an app icon to open a specific folder.\nOverall, Nova Launcher is a must-have app for anyone looking to access desktop features on their Android device. With its customizable home screen, app drawer customization, notification badges, and gesture controls, it makes it easy to access the features you need, when you need them. So why not give it a try and unlock the potential of your Android device?\nThe desktop version of Google Chrome has thousands of extensions to supercharge your browsing, from adblocking to grammar correction. Mobile Chrome users aren’t so lucky – the official mobile Chrome browser doesn’t support them. If you want to install and use Chrome extensions on your Android device, there is a workaround that we detail below.\nInstall Kiwi Browser To get started, you’ll need an alternative to the default Chrome browser. Kiwi Browser is based on the Chromium project that Chrome itself is based upon, and it looks a lot like it.\nWhile there are a lot of similarities, there are some differences you’ll need to be aware of. For instance, as it’s based on Chromium and not Chrome, you can’t use your Google account to sync your bookmarks or browser history.\nThe good news for extension fans is that, unlike Chrome on Android, Kiwi Browser supports the installation of desktop Chrome extensions with ease.\nDownload Kiwi Browser from the Google Play Store to get started.\nSearching for Chrome Extensions The tricky part about installing Chrome desktop extensions on Android is that there’s no easy portal to download them from. You have to use the Chrome Web Store, with its remarkably mobile-unfriendly design.\nHead to the Chrome Web Store and either zoom in with your fingers, or rotate your display for better access. Either way, there’s no getting around the fact that it’s going to be a little fiddly.\nFrom here, the installation process for extensions is pretty much exactly like it is on your desktop. The Chrome Web Store offers a list of recommendations, with sections for the most recently updated and popular at the top. There are also “Editors Picks,” with Google-picked selections for you to install.\nIf you want to find something specific, search for an extension you want to install using the search bar in the top-left of the page.\nAdding Chrome Extensions to Kiwi Once you’ve found an extension you like in the search, click the “Add to Chrome” button next to it. Alternatively, you can click on the store page for the extension to find out a little more about it first. The “Add to Chrome” button will appear there, too.\nIf there are any extra permissions required, you’ll be asked to approve it. Just click “OK” and wait for the extension to install. If you want to confirm that the installation is complete, click your settings button (the three vertical dots). From here, click “Extensions.”\nYou’ll see the extensions page, looking very similar to the extensions page you’ll find on Chrome. Once Kiwi Browser installs the extension, it’ll appear here, pre-enabled for use.\nYou can also load extensions manually if you have a Chrome extension CRX or ZIP file. To do that, enable “Developer Mode” in the top-right of your extensions page. From here, click “Load” and select your extension, making sure it’s enabled afterward.\nRemoving Chrome Extensions to Kiwi If you’re not keen on an extension, you can remove it in much the same way you’d remove an extension on Chrome. Go to your extensions page, locate your extension, and click “Remove.”\nKiwi Browser will ask you to confirm if you want to remove the extension. Just click “OK” to confirm the removal, or click “Cancel.”\nLike Chrome, you can also disable extensions in Kiwi Browser. Just click the blue slider, found at the bottom right of each extension on the extensions page, to disable it.\nA Desktop Web Experience on Your Phone It isn’t just extension support that makes Kiwi browser a good, open-source alternative to Google Chrome on your Android device. It comes with a built-in ad block, crypto jacking protection, and lots of customization to make it one of the best mobile browsers for Android.\nWhat are your experiences of Kiwi, and do you have any Chrome extensions that you’d recommend for Android? Let us know in the comments.\nImage Credit: Kiwi Browser Logo via Google Play Store\nBen is a UK based tech writer with a passion for gadgets, gaming, and general geekiness.\nOur latest tutorials delivered straight to your inbox\n","wordCount":"1099","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-11T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-11T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rita Hansen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-install-desktop-chrome-extensions-on-android-379719/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock the Secret to Accessing Desktop Features on Your Android Device with this One Simple Trick!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-11 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 11, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1099 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Rita Hansen</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#install-kiwi-browser>Install Kiwi Browser</a></li><li><a href=#searching-for-chrome-extensions>Searching for Chrome Extensions</a></li><li><a href=#adding-chrome-extensions-to-kiwi>Adding Chrome Extensions to Kiwi</a></li><li><a href=#removing-chrome-extensions-to-kiwi>Removing Chrome Extensions to Kiwi</a></li><li><a href=#a-desktop-web-experience-on-your-phone>A Desktop Web Experience on Your Phone</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Unlock the Secret to Accessing Desktop Features on Your Android Device with this One Simple Trick!</p><p>As technology continues to evolve, smartphones have become increasingly more powerful and sophisticated, often rivaling the capabilities of desktop computers.
