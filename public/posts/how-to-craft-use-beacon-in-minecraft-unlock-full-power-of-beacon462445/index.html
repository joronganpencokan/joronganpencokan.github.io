Minecraft is a game that has taken the world by storm since its initial release. With millions of players worldwide, Minecraft offers endless opportunities for creativity and exploration. As a sandbox-style game, players can do pretty much whatever they want in Minecraft. The game is highly customizable, and players can tailor their experience to suit their preferences. One of the most exciting aspects of Minecraft is the crafting system, which allows players to create all sorts of items that can help them survive and thrive in the world. One of the most exciting crafting items in Minecraft is the beacon.\nA beacon in Minecraft is a mysterious and powerful object that can provide players with a range of bonuses and abilities. When a beacon is activated, it creates a beam of light that extends into the sky, which can be seen from far away. This beam of light is not just decorative; it has a range of effects that can help players in their adventures. Some of the benefits of having a beacon include:\nIncreased movement speed: When a beacon is activated, players within its range can move much faster than usual. This can be extremely useful if you need to get somewhere quickly, as it can save you a lot of time.\nStrength and regeneration: Beacons can also provide players with increased strength and regeneration. This means that you can take more damage and regenerate health more quickly than usual.\nWater breathing: If you need to swim underwater for extended periods of time, a beacon can help. It can provide you with the ability to breathe underwater for as long as you are within its range.\nJump boost: Beacons can also give you the ability to jump higher than usual, which can be useful if you need to reach high places or jump over obstacles.\nResistance: With a beacon active, players can resist damage from most sources, making it much harder for enemies to take you down.\nCrafting a beacon in Minecraft is relatively easy. To create one, you will need to have an iron ingot, a nether star, and five blocks of either glass, obsidian, or iron. Once you have these items, you will need to place them in a specific pattern on a crafting table, and then you can create your beacon.\nTo use your beacon, you will need to place it on top of a pyramid made of either iron, gold, diamond, or emerald blocks. The size of the pyramid will depend on the range of the beacon’s effects. A small pyramid will give you a smaller range, while a large pyramid will give you a much wider range.\nIn conclusion, if you want to unleash the untapped potential of Minecraft, you need to start using beacons. Crafting and using beacons will give you a range of benefits and abilities that will help you in your adventures. Whether you need to move quickly, defend yourself against enemies, or overcome obstacles, a beacon can help. So go ahead and start crafting your beacon today, and experience all the benefits that it has to offer!\nCrafting Beacons is not easy in Minecraft, as it requires a super rare item Nether Star. You will need 3x Obsidian blocks, 5x Glass, and 1 Nether Star to craft Beacon. Also, read how to use it. Beacons are one of the most powerful and useful items in Minecraft.\nHow to Make a Beacon in Minecraft? In order to begin crafting a beacon, we will need a few important materials. Below is the be crafting recipe with a list of items required to proceed further.\nBeacon Crafting Recipe\n5 x glass 3 x obsidian blocks 1 x Nether Star Among all these listed materials, the Nether Star is the rarest and most difficult to find. Let’s find out how we can acquire this important item in the beacon-making process.\nWhere to find Nether Star in Minecraft? To find a Nether Star, you first need to get into the nether in Minecraft.\nOnce in the nether, you need to locate a Nether Fortress.\nWhile you’re here, you can also collect lava in a bucket to create obsidian blocks.\nIn the nether fortress, look for Wither skeletons. You’ll need the skulls from the skeletons in order to summon the Wither.\nTo summon the Wither, head underground so that you can limit its ability to attack you.\nOnce underground, summon the Wither by placing 4 blocks of soul sand in a “T” shape, with 3 Wither skeletons placed on top of the three upper blocks. Make sure that any one of the skulls is placed as the last block in the summoning process.\nOnce summoned, make sure you have Smite on your sword to double your damage while fighting the Wither.\nYou will receive the Nether Star upon defeating the Wither.\nCrafting the Beacon After receiving the Nether Star, you can work on acquiring the remaining required materials. You can acquire obsidian blocks by throwing the lava into the water. For glass, you can collect 5 pieces of sand to make 5 pieces of glass. Finally, to make the beacon you need to gather all your materials in the crafting menu. In the first row of the crafting menu, place a glass piece in each of the vacant slots. In the second row, place a glass piece in the first and third slot. Place the Nether Star in the middle slot. Now, fill the vacant slots at the bottom of the crafting menu with the obsidian blocks. And that’s how you make a beacon in Minecraft. Placing the Beacon Placing the beacon on the floor will yield no result. This is because the beacon needs to be placed on a pyramid in order to function. A pyramid can be built out of resources like emeralds, diamonds, gold, or iron. You can build a pyramid out of iron and place the beacon on it, after which you will see the beacon glow. Activating Power Boosts in Beacons You can add iron bars to the beacon in order to activate the two available power effects available for the tier. To increase the radius of the beacon and access more powers, you need to add more tiers to the beacon pyramid. A four-tier pyramid will enable you to acquire regeneration powers, which you can add to your existing powers for a boost. Customizing Your Beacon After working hard to craft your beacon, you’ll be pleased to know you can also customize your beacons with stained glasses of different colors. You can do so by stacking stained glass on top of the beacon. You can also create new colors by stacking consecutive stained glass panels. You can also place glass panes in the beam of the beacon to change the color of the beam. Just like in the beacon, you can also customize the color of the beam by stacking glass panes. So that was your detailed guide on how to make a beacon in Minecraft. As you can now see, beacons are an important element in Minecraft and with a little effort, you too can unlock the magical prowess of these rare items in Minecraft.\n","wordCount":"1211","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Florence Hoffman"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-craft-use-beacon-in-minecraft-unlock-full-power-of-beacon462445/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unleash the Untapped Potential of Minecraft with This One Simple Method: Crafting and Using Beacons!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 4, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1211 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Florence Hoffman</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#how-to-make-a-beacon-in-minecraft>How to Make a Beacon in Minecraft?</a><ul><li><a href=#where-to-find-nether-star-in-minecraft>Where to find Nether Star in Minecraft?</a></li><li><a href=#crafting-the-beacon>Crafting the Beacon</a></li><li><a href=#placing-the-beacon>Placing the Beacon</a></li><li><a href=#activating-power-boosts-in-beacons>Activating Power Boosts in Beacons</a></li><li><a href=#customizing-your-beacon>Customizing Your Beacon</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=unleash-the-untapped-potential-of-minecraft-with-this-one-simple-method-crafting-and-using-beacons>Unleash the Untapped Potential of Minecraft with This One Simple Method: Crafting and Using Beacons!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#unleash-the-untapped-potential-of-minecraft-with-this-one-simple-method-crafting-and-using-beacons>#</a></h1><p>Minecraft is a game that has taken the world by storm since its initial release.
