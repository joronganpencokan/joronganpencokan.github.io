Are you looking for a new phone that combines style and function in one sleek package? Look no further than the Moto X. But with limited availability and the tricky sales system that is used to sell them, it can be tough to get your hands on one. Fear not - we have scoured the internet and wrangled insider information to bring you the most updated guide on how to score a Moto X before they are all gone.\n1. Set Up Notifications for Key Retailers\nWhen it comes to finding a Moto X, knowing when they restock is key. Setting up alerts for retailers such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Motorola can help you stay on top of when they have new stock. Make sure to turn on push notifications for your smartphone, so you can quickly jump into the app or website as soon as new Moto Xs are available.\n2. Sign Up for Motorola Credit Account\nIf you’re serious about getting a Moto X, it may be worth considering setting up a Motorola credit account. This can give you early access to stock, free shipping (not to mention zero interest for 6 months, so financing is easy), and the possibility of exclusive discounts.\n3. Follow the Moto X Reddit Community\nThe Moto X reddit community is a powerful tool when it comes to buying this elusive phone. Members often post about any new stock or discounts they have found, as well as detailed guides on how to navigate the buying process. Lurk and learn, or contribute to the discussion and get real-time tips from other Moto X enthusiasts.\n4. Consider Refurbished Stock\nWhile it may not be the ideal way to get the phone, considering refurbished stock can help you snag a Moto X. Sites like eBay and Woot often have refurbished Moto Xs for sale, either directly from Motorola or third-party retailers. Make sure to read the seller’s reviews carefully, and a good warranty is a must.\n5. Be Quick-On-Your-Fingers\nFinally, the most obvious tip: speed is essential when it comes to grabbing a Moto X. When stock is low, your chances of snagging a new Moto X are increased by being alert at all times, using autofill on your payment details, and having all of your important data (like address, payment information and so on) saved and ready. By being efficient and quick, you improve your chances of getting a Moto X.\nIn conclusion, getting a Moto X can be challenging, but it is not impossible. By using the tips mentioned above, you can increase your chances of getting your hands on one of the most sought phones currently around. Get set, and all the best in your quest to get your very own Moto X!\nMotorola is kicking off its big promotion on the Moto X, dropping the price down to a low $349. Sales start today at Noon EST with the handset being offered on a first come, first serve basis. Read on for some tips to help make the buying process as easy as possible.\nMotorola has changed things around since Cyber Monday’s sale caused its servers to go belly up. As a result, Moto X buyers won’t have to deal with a glitchy website as they race to configure their phone and head to checkout. Instead, customers will simply register on the site with their name and email, and a promo code will be sent to that email within a few hours. Customers will have one week to redeem the code and design their phone. The promo code will be entered during the checkout process and will automatically take $150 off an order. This allows customers to buy a 16GB or 32GB handset for a discounted price. Once that first code is entered, customers can add a second code (THANKS) to take an additional 30% off accessories. Some good news if you still have a Moto X in your shopping cart from Monday. You still have to register to get a promo code like everybody else, but once you receive your code, you can go immediately to checkout. You don’t have to redesign your phone again. Straight from Motorola, here are the steps you’ll need to follow to grab your Moto X phone later today:\nGo to www.motorola.com/us/home or motorola.com/holiday2daysale and register for the promotion starting at noon EST on the two sale days. You will know right away if quantities are still available. Once registered, you will be emailed a promo code within a few hours. This code is active for one week. Go to Moto Maker and design your phone within the one week window (take your time and have fun!). At checkout, enter your one-time promo code to receive $150 off the no-contract price in the shopping cart. (Your code only works once and for one phone.) Submit your order to get rocking with your custom Moto X in time for the holidays. Moto Maker will provide an estimated delivery date while you design your product and again at checkout. You will also receive an email when we start assembling your device as well as when it ships.\nHopefully, this new checkout process will ease the burden on Motorola’s servers and the reservation process will go smoothly. If you miss out today, don’t worry as Motorola will hold a similar sale on Monday. Do you plan on buying a Moto X today? Update: The Moto X offer for Wednesday, December 4th is sold out. All the handset reservations were gone within 9 minutes. If you didn’t get one today, then check back on Monday, when a second round of sales will kick off again.\n","wordCount":"967","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-15T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-15T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ryan Jenkins"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-reserve-a-moto-x-when-sales-kick-off-today-updated-sold-out-1083295/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Secret Tricks Revealed: Score a Moto X Before They're All Gone - Our Updated Guide to Beat the Tricky Sales System!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-15 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 15, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;967 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Ryan Jenkins</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=secret-tricks-revealed-score-a-moto-x-before-theyre-all-gone---our-updated-guide-to-beat-the-tricky-sales-system>Secret Tricks Revealed: Score a Moto X Before They&rsquo;re All Gone - Our Updated Guide to Beat the Tricky Sales System!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#secret-tricks-revealed-score-a-moto-x-before-theyre-all-gone---our-updated-guide-to-beat-the-tricky-sales-system>#</a></h1><p>Are you looking for a new phone that combines style and function in one sleek package?
