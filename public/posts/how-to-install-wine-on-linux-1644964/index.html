Do you need access to Windows-based applications but don’t want to switch to a Windows operating system? Good news! Wine allows you to run Windows software on Linux! This guide will walk you through the simple installation process so that you can unlock a world of Windows software on your Linux computer.\nWhat is Wine? Wine is an open-source software application that allows you to run Windows-based applications on Linux. It is a compatibility layer that translates the Windows API (Application Programming Interface) calls into ones that the Linux operating system can understand. In other words, it allows Linux to behave like Windows so that you can run Windows software on your Linux computer.\nInstallation Guide The installation process for Wine can vary depending on your Linux distribution. However, most Linux distributions include Wine in their official repositories. To install Wine, follow these steps:\nStep 1: Open your terminal To open your terminal, press the Ctrl, Alt, and T keys simultaneously. This should bring up your terminal window.\nStep 2: Install Wine Enter the following command in your terminal window:\nsudo apt-get install wine\nThis will start the installation process. Depending on your internet speed, this could take a few minutes. Once the installation is complete, Wine will be ready to use.\nStep 3: Test Wine After installing Wine, you’ll want to test it to make sure it’s working properly. To do this, download a simple Windows-based application, such as Notepad++, and try to run it with Wine.\nTo do this, right-click the Notepad++ installation file and select “Open With Wine Windows Program Loader.” If everything has been installed correctly, Notepad++ should launch and run smoothly on your Linux computer.\nConclusion Wine is a great tool for those who need access to Windows-based software but don’t want to switch to a Windows operating system. It’s easy to install and use, allowing users to unlock a world of software options on their Linux computers. With Wine, you can seamlessly run Windows-based applications on Linux, providing a solution for those who need the best of both worlds.\nThe biggest difficulty most Windows users face when they switch to a Linux distribution is the inability to run their favorite Windows software, especially games. Gaming on Linux has improved, but to play Windows-only games on Linux, you’ll need to use Wine.\nWine is designed to help bridge the gap between Windows and Linux software, making Windows-only games and software compatible without massive performance penalties. Here’s how to install Wine on Linux.\nInstalling Wine As one of the most well-known Linux packages, installing Wine should be pretty straightforward on the most popular Linux distributions. You can download, compile and install the appropriate packages from the Wine website, or use the packages supplied as part of your Linux distribution.\nHowever, you should check first whether you’re running on a 64-bit version of Linux. To do that, open your terminal and type lscpu.\nThis should display some technical information about your PC.\nUnder the “CPU op-modes” section, if you only see 32-bit, install the 32-bit version of Wine. Otherwise, install the 64-bit version.\nTo install the 32-bit version of Wine on Ubuntu and Debian-based operating systems, type:\nOtherwise, to install the 64-bit version, type:\nIf Wine is already installed on your Linux PC, and you’re unsure which version you have installed, open a terminal and type:\nThis will display the version of Wine you have installed as well as the version number.\nConfiguring Wine In many cases, you won’t need to configure Wine itself after it’s installed, but you will need to generate Wine’s configuration before you can use it.\nBy running the GUI Wine configuration tool, you’ll generate a fresh configuration file for Wine which you can then configure to your own requirements later.\nTo run it, open your terminal window and type:\nIt may take a few moments for your initial Wine configuration file to be generated. Once it is, the configuration tool will open. If you don’t plan on changing Wine’s configuration, it’s safe to close it at this point by clicking “OK.”\nUsing the Wine application database, you can find relevant settings for any Windows games or software you’re looking to run. You can then modify your settings using the Wine configuration tool to meet these requirements.\nInstalling Windows Games Using Wine To run Windows games or software, you’ll need to download the files for them as you would on Windows. Some may have specific installation instructions, so be sure to check for an entry in the Wine application database first.\nMany Windows installers come as EXE files. Linux doesn’t generally support EXE files, but using Wine, you can use them.\nTo run a Windows installer on Linux, download and place the EXE file in a suitable location. Open a terminal window and type:\nThis will run the installer file where you can follow the installation process in the same way you would on Windows.\nIf you ever need to uninstall any Windows software, open the terminal and type:\nThis brings up a Windows-style control panel where you can find examples of your existing software and remove them. You can also remove the files manually.\nRunning Windows Games and Software Using Wine Typically, Windows files are installed to the “C” drive. As this doesn’t exist on Linux, Wine creates a folder (usually /home/your-username/.wine/drive_c) to act as the “C” drive for your Windows software.\nThis is where you’ll need to locate any installed software or games. To do that, search through and find the EXE file for the software you’re looking to run.\nThis is probably going to be found in the “Program Files” or “Program Files (x86” folders. Once you’ve located your software, you can run it the same way you ran the installer.\nTo do that, open your terminal window and type:\nUsing Wine, your Windows software or game should run on your Linux desktop in much the same way as it would natively on Windows.\nIt isn’t a perfect solution, so if you run into difficulties, check the Wine application database listing for your game or software to find further advice. Your software or game may have specific instructions to consider before you run it.\nRunning Windows Games and Software on Linux With Wine, you don’t need to give up using Windows software and playing Windows-only games. As it doesn’t emulate a Windows PC, you can dedicate the full power of your system resources to your Linux distro, too.\nSome of the best Windows games can be played on Linux using Wine. There are also plenty of other top free Linux games you could play instead, too.\nBen is a UK based tech writer with a passion for gadgets, gaming, and general geekiness.\nOur latest tutorials delivered straight to your inbox\n","wordCount":"1148","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-31T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-31T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"April Fontenot"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-install-wine-on-linux-1644964/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock a world of Windows software on your Linux computer with this simple Wine installation guide!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 31, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1148 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;April Fontenot</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#installing-wine>Installing Wine</a></li><li><a href=#configuring-wine>Configuring Wine</a></li><li><a href=#installing-windows-games-using-wine>Installing Windows Games Using Wine</a></li><li><a href=#running-windows-games-and-software-using-wine>Running Windows Games and Software Using Wine</a></li><li><a href=#running-windows-games-and-software-on-linux>Running Windows Games and Software on Linux</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Introduction
