Do you use Google to search the internet, use Gmail for your email, or use Google Maps to get directions? If you do, then you’re being tracked by Google, and they’ve been secretly tracking your every move. This might come as a shock to some, but it’s true - Google has a secret plan to track every aspect of your life.\nJust imagine: Google tracking your every move through your mobile device or laptop, gathering information about your location, what you search, what you buy, and even what you like on social media. The technology giant claims to use this information to make our searches more personalized and tailored to our interests, but that’s not the whole truth. In reality, they use it to build detailed profiles on each of us to target us with ads and sell our data to third parties.\nThe extent of Google’s tracking can be shocking to some. Have you ever noticed that when you search for a product, you start seeing ads for similar items on every website you visit? That’s Google’s tracking technology, and it’s happening in real-time. Google even tracks you when you’re offline, thanks to the fact that most apps require ongoing permissions to share your location data, even when you’re not using them.\nBut it’s not just Google that’s doing this. Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, and many other companies are also tracking our every move. These companies thrive off the data gathered from us, and they’re not going to stop anytime soon. So, what can we do about it?\nFirstly, it’s important to realize the extent of the issue. You’re not only being tracked by Google, but by many other companies as well. Once you realize this, you can take action to protect yourself. You can start by checking your Google account’s privacy settings and adjusting them accordingly.\nNext, you can install an ad-blocker on your browser to stop ads from following you around the internet. There are also privacy-focused search engines like DuckDuckGo that do not track your searches in the way that Google does.\nFinally, if you want to take complete control of your online privacy, you can use a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt all of your internet traffic and hide your IP address. This will prevent Google and other tracking companies from monitoring your online activity and tracking your location.\nIn conclusion, Google’s secret plan to track your every move is not something to be taken lightly. It’s important to take steps to protect your online privacy and be aware of the extent to which you are being tracked. By adjusting your privacy settings, installing ad-blockers, and using VPNs, you can take control of your online presence and erase Google’s tracking forever.\nEmbarrassing queries aside, there are certain things you should never search using Google for an entirely different reason. It can totally open you up to scams and malware. Tap or click for seven risky search terms to avoid. And then there are things you’d rather not have accessible to the world. Here’s how to remove your home from Google Street View. If you’ve ever been curious about what secrets Google knows about you, here’s your chance to find out. Here’s a quick way to see first-hand. Prepared to be shocked First, make sure you’re signed in to your Google account. If you’re using Chrome and see your photo or initial in the top right corner, you’re good to go. Otherwise, go to myaccount.google.com and sign in. Next, open a new browser tab and search for the term “Google ad settings.” Click the first result that pops up. This brings you to your ad personalization page. It displays a long list of what Google “knows” about you and topics the company thinks you are most interested in. You’ll likely see dozens of results. A quick search may show that you are obsessed with the Royal family or even something more obscure like school supplies. Google’s assumptions aren’t always right. Take my results. Google thinks I don’t have children, male and like heavy metal music. But amid those three strike-outs, Google nailed it with tech, jets and tea. RELATED: Sick of being tracked? Use these Google alternatives for search, mail, and more Stop ad personalization with a click Now that the fun (or unsettling) part is over, time to get to work. These private details are compiled from all the searches you’ve done, links you’ve clicked, YouTube videos you’ve watched, articles you’ve read and more. Maybe you scanned through your list and were glad to see just how off Google was when it comes to your interests. Or maybe they were a little too on the money for comfort. You can switch off the ad personalization settings at the top of your Google ad settings page with one easy click. Be sure to click Advanced to expand another box. Here you can allow or prevent Google from using data from “websites and apps that partner with Google” to personalize further what you see across the web. You can also find out more about why specific details have ended up on your profile. Click on an interest or demographic to get a pop-up that gives you a bit more information about why it’s part of your profile. Choose “turn off” to delete this demographic entirely, removing the tag from your profile. RELATED: Be a pro and try these five quick and easy tips for better Google Search results.\nErasing your data If you toggled ad personalization off, don’t expect to stop seeing ads. It also doesn’t mean you have wiped your data from Google’s databases entirely. To do that, you need to dive deeper into your Google account settings. We’ve got a step-by-step guide showing you how to erase everything you can. The first step, of course, is clearing your search history and activity.\nGo to myaccount.google.com and log in. Click Manage your Google Account.Click Manage your data \u0026 personalization, located under Privacy \u0026 Personalization.Under the Activity controls panel, you will see checkmarks next to Web \u0026 App activity tracking, Location History, and YouTube History. Click each one to adjust your settings. You can toggle them off to stop further tracking.Below Activity controls, click on My Activity under Activity and timeline.On the menu that appears in the left sidebar, click Delete activity by. Select how far back you would like to delete your history in the pop-up menu. Click Delete to confirm.\nThat’s only the beginning.
