We carefully curate our profiles, select our friends, and exercise caution in what we post. However, the reality is that we are living in an era where data is the new gold. And Facebook is leading the pack when it comes to mining data from unsuspecting users.\nEver wondered how Facebook ads seem to cater so perfectly to your interests? The answer is simple – by collecting data. And while this is nothing new, advertising on Facebook has become increasingly sophisticated, giving advertisers access to a treasure trove of personal data.\nSo, what exactly do these advertisers know about you? And how can you find out?\nThe first step is to know that Facebook collects data from a variety of sources, including your activity on its platform, interactions with other users, and even off-platform browsing. This information is then used to create detailed user profiles, which advertisers can use to target their ads. But Facebook doesn’t stop there. It also partners with third-party data providers, which obtain data on user behavior from other sources like credit reports, loyalty card activity, and even public records. This allows advertisers to target potential customers based on factors like income, age, location, and even purchasing habits.\nSo, now that you know how Facebook collects data, let’s talk about uncovering the information that advertisers hold about you.\nFacebook has a tool known as “Your Ad Preferences,” which allows you to view and adjust the information that advertisers see on your profile. To access it, simply click on the three lines in the top right corner of Facebook, then select “Settings \u0026 Privacy,” followed by “Settings.” From there, click on “Ads,” and then “Your Information.” This will give you a complete breakdown of the categories that Facebook uses to group its users, including everything from technology to hobbies and interests.\nFrom there, you can click on each category to see the data that Facebook has provided, then remove any information or interests that are no longer relevant. You can also view the businesses that have used this data to target ads to you, along with the number of times they have displayed ads.\nBut here’s the scary part – the information you see in “Your Ad Preferences” is only the tip of the iceberg. Facebook retains a complex algorithm to determine which ads you see, and most of this information is not available for users to view. This means that advertisers have a far more detailed profile of you than you might imagine, and there’s very little you can do to change this.\nSo, what can you do to protect your privacy on Facebook?\nThe first step is to be vigilant about what you share online. Consider every post you make, every like you give, and every link you click, as an opportunity to reveal another aspect of your personality to Facebook – and by extension, to advertisers.\nSecondly, be mindful of the permissions you give to third-party apps that use Facebook data. These apps often request access to a range of data, from your friend list to your location, and it’s up to you to decide whether they need this information to function.\nLastly, consider using ad-blocking software, which can help reduce the number of ads you see on Facebook, but also limit the amount of data that Facebook can gather from you.\nIn conclusion, Facebook has evolved into a platform that holds a significant amount of personal data. While this data is used primarily for advertising purposes, it can also be used for more insidious reasons. As such, it’s important to be aware of the information that Facebook holds about you, and take steps to protect your privacy online. With a little bit of effort, you can regain control over your digital life and keep the advertisers at bay.\nMost of you have probably heard the phrase “If you’re not paying for it, you are the product.” It’s generally used to illustrate the fact that supposedly “free” services and consumer goods are anything but. With the advent of television, free-to-air television shows were supported by advertisements directed at viewers. Fast forward to the modern day and the Internet has made it possible for advertisers to integrate themselves into virtually every aspect of our lives.\nAn individual’s right to privacy is a hot button issue today in a world dominated by social media. It’s no surprise that tech giants like Facebook and Google generate mountains of revenue from targeted advertisements. These advertisements reach us based on our activities online which are being monitored constantly. Everything from our political leanings to where we shop is carefully collected and collated to compose a profile which companies then use to present you with advertisements tailored to your tastes. It’s important that individuals know which companies and organizations have access to their data. But where do you start? Luckily, Facebook makes it pretty easy to do; however, they make zero effort in pointing this out to their users.\nCheck Which Advertisers Have Your Info On Facebook you can see which advertisers have your personal info by heading into your account settings. Full disclosure: you may be in for a shock! To do so, point your browser to the Facebook website. Click the arrow in the top-right side to reveal a drop-down menu. Clicking on “Settings” will bring you to the Settings menu. On the left side you’ll notice a column with a list of options. Scroll down to the one labelled “Ads” and click that.\nFrom there you’ll be brought to your Facebook profile’s Ad Preferences page. Clicking on “Advertisers You’ve Interacted With” will list all of the businesses you’ve interacted with. Have you noticed any surprises? It’s not uncommon for users to see businesses they’ve never interacted with, much less have even heard of before. For example, the picture below is from my personal Facebook account. I’ve never had the need to purchase a surgical cap, nor have I ever been to Houston. (Although I’m sure the House of Blues there is a fine establishment.)\nThis is because until very recently, Facebook used middle man “data brokers,” entities who sell your contact info to businesses and corporations. You can block ads individually by highlighting each advertiser and clicking the “X” that appears. By default, Facebook only lists 12 advertisers, so don’t forget to click the teeny tiny “See more” button for even more surprises.\nChange Your Ad Preferences At this stage you’re probably feeling numerous emotions. Betrayal, anger, regret – these are all rational responses to the voluntary violations of privacy we all agreed to when we signed up for Facebook. Fortunately, you can wrestle some control back from the Facebook overlords.\nThe first thing you’ll want to do is click on the “Your Information” banner on your profile’s Ad Preferences page. This will cue a drop-down panel to appear with toggle switches related to your job, employer, relationship status and education. By default, all of these toggles will be on. Go ahead and flick them all off. When on, this allows advertisers to find you and collect your info based on the details provided in your profile.\nNext, click on the banner labelled “Ad settings.” Here you’ll see three buttons: Ads based on data from partners, Ads based on your Activity on Facebook and Ads that include your social actions. Clicking on each one will give you information detailing what exactly each one of those means, including what data is being collected and by whom. Additionally, you’ll see a drop-down box that allows you to prevent the collection and use of this data. As you may have guessed, you’re going to want to deny permission to each.\nHow to Opt Out of Advertising Unfortunately, this isn’t really possible. Facebook’s bread and butter is advertising, so that’s not going to go away any time soon. There have been rumors floating around for some time suggesting that a subscription model might be in the works; however, this is unlikely. It’s just more lucrative to harvest and sell user data. However, you may consider giving up Facebook altogether. Before you do, make sure you download all of your important data.\nHow do you feel about data collection as it pertains to Facebook and other social media companies?
