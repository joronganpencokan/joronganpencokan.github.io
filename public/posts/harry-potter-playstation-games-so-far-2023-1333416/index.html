And now, fans around the world have something to look forward to with the upcoming release of two new Harry Potter Playstation games, set to release in 2023.\nFans have been eagerly awaiting these games since their announcement in 2020, and now a sneak peek of what these games will entail has been unveiled.\nThe first game, titled “Hogwarts Legacy,” puts players in the shoes of a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the late 1800s. Players will be able to fully customize their character and attend classes, learn spells, explore the Wizarding World, and interact with iconic characters from the books and movies.\nThe game promises to be a highly immersive experience, allowing players to explore every nook and cranny of Hogwarts, from the Forbidden Forest to the Great Hall. The game also promises to have a deep storyline, with players having the ability to make choices that will impact the world around them.\nThe second game, titled “Harry Potter: Magic Awakened,” is a card battle game that allows players to collect and battle with their favorite characters from the Harry Potter series. Players will be able to collect trading cards featuring characters, spells, and creatures from the Wizarding World, and build their own deck for battle.\nIn addition to the exciting gameplay, both games promise to have stunning graphics and immersive sound design, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in the magical world of Harry Potter.\nThe release date for these highly anticipated games has been set for 2023, with no specific date announced as of yet. However, fans can expect to see more teasers and announcements in the coming months leading up to the release.\nOverall, the announcement of these two new Harry Potter Playstation games has fans around the world buzzing with excitement. The ability to fully immerse oneself in the world of Harry Potter, attend classes at Hogwarts, and battle with favorite characters promises to be an unforgettable gaming experience. So mark your calendars for 2023 and get ready for some magical fun!\nHarry Potter fandom has been around in this world for over two decades now \u0026 why is it still famous around wizards and muggles? Because of the wizarding world created by Rowling. There are 7 books and around 8 film adaptations to the installment with the last movie divided into two parts (Deathly Hallows Part 1 \u0026 Part 2). “But clearly, Fame isn’t everything. Is it Potter?” In these years, different spin-off novels, video games, and mobile games spanned across the hands of Muggles. Let’s look at all the Harry Potter PlayStation games so far.\nAll Harry Potter PlayStation Games So Far Here’s are all the Harry Potter games on PlayStation.\nTable of Contents\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone In this installment of the series, Harry makes his best friends, and learns about the existence of “that who shall not be named”. Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s or Sorcerer’s stone is a third-person action-puzzle game, and its gameplay for the PlayStation version varied from the PC version. The game was more influenced by the movie rather than the books. You have to choose one out of the 4 houses at the beginning of the game. Although the game was bashed by critics for its graphics, it was the highest-selling video game by December 2001.\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Its gameplay was almost similar to its predecessor game with some additions like learning the spells and how to ride a broomstick. Harry Potter and Chamber of Secrets was an upgrade to the first game in terms of graphics and gameplay on the PlayStation. It was mostly received positively among the critics.\nAvailable on PS2. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban This is one of the most important parts of the Harry Potter series as this is when Harry finally meets his Godfather (no spoilers). Overall, Prisoner of Azkaban is a short game to complete. Its PS and PC versions varied from each other like the previous ones. What I love about this game is that you can also switch and play as Harry’s friends- Hermione and Ron. With each of the three having unique abilities, you can also combine your spells for a bigger impact.\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire This is the first Harry Potter game that is more action-based than any of its predecessors. It involved less puzzle solving and more of the storyline. The graphics of the game were a big upgrade and the characters resembled more to their film counterparts. You can play one of the three characters that you can choose at the beginning of the game. As you choose one out of three characters, the other two become your supporting NPCs for collaborative spells. These three characters include Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The game also added multiplayer mode for the first time in the installment series which allowed the players to invite friends.\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix For all the players waiting to explore the world of Hogwarts with free roam, Order of Phoenix is a treat for all the fans. This game involves recruiting members for the Dumbledore Army and wreaking destruction like the Weasley brothers when Umbridge replaces Dumbledore. This game also gives you a rare opportunity of playing as Sirius Black and Dumbledore during certain duels in the storyline. The game included Room of Rewards which featured trophies and several behind-the-scenes (videos) from the production.\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince This is my favourite installment out of the Harry Potter series. The graphics were improved but were quite similar to the previous game. You can play one out of three characters in the series. These include Harry, Ginny, and Ron. The critics had mixed responses to the game with most of the critics not liking the addition of quests in the game. Some of the cast members of the movies like Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), and Ginny (Bonnie Wright) lent their voices for the first time in the game.\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – P1 I wish I could use the obliviate spell to forget this game. As Harry and his friends mature into growing adults, the developers of the game decided to go with a darker tone. In this game, you will explore the world outside Hogwarts as Harry and his friends embark on their hunt for Horcruxes. You can give headshots to Death Eaters, Dementors, and several creatures of the wizarding world. But can you imagine a third-person shooter game with wands? This is where things went haywire for the game. Although the game was praised for its dark aesthetics, the audience and the critics did not approve of its action-based gameplay. The game received heavy negative responses from the audience as well as critics.\nAvailable on PS3. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – P2 Taking remarks from the predecessor game, the developers tweaked and modified the gameplay of Deathly Hallows Part 2 into lesser evil than the first part. In this game, your spells function as different types of guns. For instance, if you cast Stupefy spell it will function as a pistol. Other spells function as different guns too. You can switch between controlling several characters like Neville, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, and more. The game is mostly story-based and does not include any side missions. Almost to the showdown, Harry receives the ability to Apparate (teleport) in defence against Voldemort. But despite their efforts, the game could not fit as a notable conclusion to the video game series.\nHarry Potter PlayStation Games (Spin-Offs) So Far Here are all spin-off Harry Potter games available on PlayStation\nHarry Potter: Quidditch World Cup Apparently, something bad and dramatic always happens at Quidditch sports. The Quidditch sport involves four positions which are Seeker, Chaser, Beater, and Keeper. You can either play in Hogwarts involving the four houses of Hogwarts or you can have a match against other countries in World Cup mode. This World Cup mode includes several national teams with the addition of Victor Krum as a star player from Goblet of Fire. Or you can play an Exhibition match which is a 1v1 Quidditch game against a national team. You can also fly your broomstick and face-off against your friend in a multiplayer mode in an Exhibition match.\nLego Harry Potter: Years 1–4 The game features and covers the first four adaptations of the Harry Potter series in a Lego style. These include Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s stone, Chambers of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, and the Goblet of Fire. You can play your favourite characters in Lego stylized forms. The game received a positive response from the critics as well as the general audience.\nLego Harry Potter: Years 5–7 Like the previous Lego Harry Potter, this game adapts the final three books and four movies in a lego style. It was praised well by the critics for its humorous cut-scenes and soundtracks.\nLego Harry Potter (Collection) It is a compilation of both the Lego Harry Potter games for PS4 players. These games include all the DLCs in both games and are remastered for better graphics.\nBook of Spells Book of Potions This game too like Book of potions is an AR game that starts with the player choosing a house and a wand. This game is based on a book written by a potion maker Zygmunt Budge of the Potterverse. The game involves a student of Hogwarts finding the Book of Potions and learning the art of brewing potions as you proceed.\nBonus Hogwarts Legacy Hogwarts Legacy is an upcoming action and roleplaying game where you can explore the magical open world in the 1800s. The game will also let you choose your house and other decisions as morality system will be included in this game.\nIf you are Potterhead and you loved the movies more than the books you can watch Harry Potter: Return to Hogwarts. It is a documentary featuring a reunion of all the cast members along with J.K Rowling. The documentary will feature insights, behind-the-scenes of the cast, and bloopers. It will be fun to watch the cast reunite after more than a decade.\nThat was all on all the Harry Potter games on PlayStation.

The game included Room of Rewards which featured trophies and several behind-the-scenes (videos) from the production.</p><h3 id=harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince>#</a></h3><p>This is my favourite installment out of the Harry Potter series. The graphics were improved but were quite similar to the previous game. You can play one out of three characters in the series. These include Harry, Ginny, and Ron. The critics had mixed responses to the game with most of the critics not liking the addition of quests in the game. Some of the cast members of the movies like Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), and Ginny (Bonnie Wright) lent their voices for the first time in the game.</p><h3 id=harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows--p1>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – P1<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows--p1>#</a></h3><p>I wish I could use the obliviate spell to forget this game. As Harry and his friends mature into growing adults, the developers of the game decided to go with a darker tone. In this game, you will explore the world outside Hogwarts as Harry and his friends embark on their hunt for Horcruxes. You can give headshots to Death Eaters, Dementors, and several creatures of the wizarding world. But can you imagine a third-person shooter game with wands? This is where things went haywire for the game. Although the game was praised for its dark aesthetics, the audience and the critics did not approve of its action-based gameplay. The game received heavy negative responses from the audience as well as critics.</p><p> </p><ul><li>Available on PS3.</li></ul><h3 id=harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows--p2>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – P2<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows--p2>#</a></h3><p>Taking remarks from the predecessor game, the developers tweaked and modified the gameplay of Deathly Hallows Part 2 into lesser evil than the first part. In this game, your spells function as different types of guns. For instance, if you cast Stupefy spell it will function as a pistol. Other spells function as different guns too. You can switch between controlling several characters like Neville, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, and more. The game is mostly story-based and does not include any side missions. Almost to the showdown, Harry receives the ability to Apparate (teleport) in defence against Voldemort. But despite their efforts, the game could not fit as a notable conclusion to the video game series.</p><h2 id=harry-potter-playstation-games-spin-offs-so-far>Harry Potter PlayStation Games (Spin-Offs) So Far<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#harry-potter-playstation-games-spin-offs-so-far>#</a></h2><p>Here are all spin-off Harry Potter games available on PlayStation</p><h3 id=harry-potter-quidditch-world-cup>Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#harry-potter-quidditch-world-cup>#</a></h3><p>Apparently, something bad and dramatic always happens at Quidditch sports. The Quidditch sport involves four positions which are Seeker, Chaser, Beater, and Keeper. You can either play in Hogwarts involving the four houses of Hogwarts or you can have a match against other countries in World Cup mode. This World Cup mode includes several national teams with the addition of Victor Krum as a star player from Goblet of Fire. Or you can play an Exhibition match which is a 1v1 Quidditch game against a national team. You can also fly your broomstick and face-off against your friend in a multiplayer mode in an Exhibition match.</p><h3 id=lego-harry-potter-years-14>Lego Harry Potter: Years 1–4<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#lego-harry-potter-years-14>#</a></h3><p>The game features and covers the first four adaptations of the Harry Potter series in a Lego style. These include Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s stone, Chambers of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, and the Goblet of Fire. You can play your favourite characters in Lego stylized forms. The game received a positive response from the critics as well as the general audience.</p><h3 id=lego-harry-potter-years-57>Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#lego-harry-potter-years-57>#</a></h3><p>Like the previous Lego Harry Potter, this game adapts the final three books and four movies in a lego style. It was praised well by the critics for its humorous cut-scenes and soundtracks.</p><h3 id=lego-harry-potter-collection>Lego Harry Potter (Collection)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#lego-harry-potter-collection>#</a></h3><p>It is a compilation of both the Lego Harry Potter games for PS4 players.

This game is based on a book written by a potion maker Zygmunt Budge of the Potterverse. The game involves a student of Hogwarts finding the Book of Potions and learning the art of brewing potions as you proceed.</p><h2 id=bonus>Bonus<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bonus>#</a></h2><h3 id=hogwarts-legacy>Hogwarts Legacy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hogwarts-legacy>#</a></h3><p>Hogwarts Legacy is an upcoming action and roleplaying game where you can explore the magical open world in the 1800s. The game will also let you choose your house and other decisions as morality system will be included in this game.</p><p>If you are Potterhead and you loved the movies more than the books you can watch Harry Potter: Return to Hogwarts. It is a documentary featuring a reunion of all the cast members along with J.K Rowling. The documentary will feature insights, behind-the-scenes of the cast, and bloopers. It will be fun to watch the cast reunite after more than a decade.</p><p>That was all on all the Harry Potter games on PlayStation.
