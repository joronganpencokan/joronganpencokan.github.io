Are you tired of your boring iPhone ringtones and want to add a personal touch to your phone? Then it’s time to revamp your iPhone with a custom song ringtone! With this ultimate DIY guide, you can create a unique ringtone that reflects your personality and style.\nStep 1: Choose a Song The first step to creating a custom ringtone is to choose a song that you like. You can choose any song from your music library or download a new one. Make sure it’s a song that you won’t get tired of quickly.\nStep 2: Trim the Song Once you have chosen your song, it’s time to trim it down to the perfect ringtone length. Open the song in your preferred music editing software and select the section you want to use as your ringtone. Keep in mind that the ideal length for a ringtone is around 30 seconds.\nStep 3: Convert the Song to a Ringtone Format After trimming the song, you’ll need to convert it to a ringtone format. On a Mac, you can use the iTunes app to convert your song to an M4R format, which is the format used for ringtones on iPhones. On a PC, you can use any ringtone conversion software.\nStep 4: Add the Ringtone to Your iPhone The next step is to add the newly created ringtone to your iPhone. Connect your iPhone to your computer and open iTunes. Choose your iPhone from the device list and go to the Tones tab. Drag and drop the ringtone file into the Tones section.\nStep 5: Set the Ringtone The final step is to set your new custom ringtone as your default ringtone. Go to Settings \u003e Sounds \u0026 Haptics \u003e Ringtone and select your new custom ringtone from the list.\nAnd there you have it, a unique and personalized ringtone that no one else has! With this guide, creating a custom ringtone is easy and fun. So why settle for the default ringtone when you can have a custom one that reflects your personality and style?\nThis article explains how to set a song as a custom iPhone ringtone using iTunes 9, 10, 11, and 12.\nWhat to Know\nCreate clip: Select song \u003e set clip start/stop \u003e File \u003e Convert \u003e Convert to AAC \u003e change file to M4R.Install clip: Connect phone to iTunes \u003e select iPhone \u003e Tones \u003e On My Device \u003e drag/drop M4R file to Tones.Set ringtone: Open Settings \u003e Sounds \u0026 Haptics \u003e Ringtone \u003e select new ringtone. How to Make a Song into a Ringtone The process starts on your computer, where you will use iTunes to choose a 30-second portion of a song and export that song clip in a file format that your iPhone can recognize as a ringtone.\nStart iTunes on your computer. It’s always a good idea to make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes, especially if you don’t use it often, to make sure it will sync properly with your phone. If iTunes offers to install the latest update, let that occur before proceeding. From the iTunes music library, find a song that you want to turn into a ringtone and click on it to select the song. Play the song and decide what 30 second snippet of the song you want to make into a ringtone. It can be any point in the song. Write down the start and stop time so you know what time you’ll set in a few steps. Right-click the song and choose Song Info from the drop-down menu. In the Song Info dialog box, click the Options tab. In the start and stop fields, enter the time you want the ringtone to start and stop and ensure box boxes are checked. For example, if you want the first 30 seconds of the song, choose 0:00 and 0:30. Click OK when you’re done. Your ringtone must not exceed 30 seconds or it won’t work, so be sure you do your math correctly. Click the File menu and choose Convert, then Convert to AAC Version. After a moment, you should see the new version of the song appear in the music library, directly under the currently selected original version of the track. On older versions of iTunes, you might need to right-click the song and choose Create AAC Version from the drop-down menu. Select the new AAC version of the song and copy it to a location on your computer. You can simply drag it to your desktop or another folder. Back in iTunes, you won’t need that newly created AAC version, so you can delete it by pressing the Delete key. The original track is still set to only play for 30 seconds, so you can fix that as well. Right click the track and choose Song Info. On the Options tab, clear the checkmarks for start and stop. Click OK to save your changes. Now, locate the ringtone file you had copied out of iTunes. On a PC, click the View tab at the top of the folder and then check File name extensions in the ribbon. If you’re using a Mac, click the Finder menu, and then choose Preferences.In the Finder Preferences, check Show all filename extensions. Click on the song file and then, after a moment, click it a second time so you can edit the filename. Click the filename extension and change it from M4A to M4R, and press Enter. If requested, confirm that you want to make this change. Sync the Ringtone to Your iPhone Once you’ve created your new ringtone, then you need to sync it to your iPhone so you can begin using it. The sync process is pretty straightforward.\nStart iTunes on your computer.
