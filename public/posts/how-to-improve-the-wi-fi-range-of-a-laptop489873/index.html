Are you tired of constantly losing your signal or waiting endlessly for pages to load? Well, fret no more! There is a simple trick you can do to boost your laptop’s internet speed and range.\nThe trick is… using a USB wireless adapter! That’s right, a small device that connects to your laptop’s USB port can significantly enhance your internet experience.\nUSB wireless adapters work by upgrading your laptop’s built-in wireless card to a stronger and faster one. This can increase your transfer rates and range, resulting in faster downloads and better internet connectivity. Additionally, USB adapters have larger antennas that can pick up signals from farther distances, meaning you can access the internet from greater distances than before.\nBut how exactly do you go about selecting the right USB wireless adapter for your laptop? Here are a few things to keep in mind:\nCompatibility: Make sure the adapter you choose is compatible with your laptop’s operating system. Check for compatibility with your version of Windows, Mac, or Linux.\nSpeed: Look for adapters with 802.11ac or 802.11ax technology, as they offer faster internet speeds than older standards.\nRange: Consider the size and layout of your home or office and choose an adapter with a range that will work for your needs. If you have a large home or office, look for an adapter with an external antenna for better signal range.\nBrand: Look for reputable brands with good customer reviews to ensure reliability and efficiency. Some popular brands include Netgear, TP-Link, and Linksys.\nOnce you have selected your USB wireless adapter, installing it is easy. Simply plug it into your laptop’s USB port and follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Once installed, you should see an immediate improvement in your internet speed and range.\nIn conclusion, a USB wireless adapter is an easy and affordable way to boost your laptop’s internet speed and range. By following the tips above, you can choose the right adapter for your needs and enjoy faster and more reliable internet connectivity. So go ahead, give your laptop the boost it deserves and enjoy a better internet experience!\nWherever you use a laptop computer, a strong Wi-Fi signal ensures reliable connectivity and good connection speed. Laptops with limited signal range suffer from slow or dropped connections. Modern laptops have a built-in wireless network adapter. Older laptops require an external network adapter such as a PCMCIA card or a USB adapter.\nTake the following steps to improve the range of your laptop and the speed of your connection if you have problems with your Wi-Fi connection.\nEnvironmental Factors That Affect Wi-Fi Range Several environmental factors can cause a weak Wi-Fi signal. In a home network environment, there’s a lot you can do about these common culprits.\nRouter Distance A laptop can get a Wi-Fi signal within a limited distance from the router. Move the laptop closer to the wireless router to combat this problem. The closer the laptop is to the router, the better the signal.\nIf moving closer to the router isn’t possible, maybe because your home office is too far from it, move the router closer to the laptop. If you do that, be sure the router isn’t on or near the floor because that can make the signal worse.\nThere are many ways to test the speed of the laptop connection at various areas of your house or office to see where you need to be for a good signal.\nWeak Signal If you can’t reposition the router to a central location or move the laptop closer to the router, add a Wi-Fi repeater. These devices plug into a power outlet between your laptop and the router. Wi-Fi repeaters repeat the Wi-Fi signal, effectively expanding the Wi-Fi range further through your house.\nA similar option that can extend Wi-Fi through your house is to buy a wireless mesh system. A mesh network consists of more than one router that blankets multiple rooms with Wi-Fi.\nAnother solution for a weak Wi-Fi signal that’s helpful, if moving the router isn’t an option, is to invest in a long-range router. These routers have several antennas that push the signal further than a traditional router.\nSee how mesh networks differ from range extenders if you’re not sure which to go with.\nObstructing Objects Metal structures and large appliances between the laptop and the router can obstruct the signal. Relocate your laptop or desk to avoid these signal killers.\nOther Wireless Devices To obtain the strongest Wi-Fi signal, limit the number of devices that access the Wi-Fi connection simultaneously. With the popularity of streaming movies, tablets, mobile phones, and smart devices, your laptop may not be the only equipment that uses the Wi-Fi connection.\nAs more devices go online behind a single router, the limited bandwidth capacity of the network is split between each device, essentially slowing everything down.\nUpdate Your Equipment and Software The strength of a Wi-Fi signal and its range are also dependent on the router, its drivers and firmware, and the software on the laptop.\nUse a Newer Wi-Fi Standard Replace your router when technology standards change. For example, 802.11ac routers are faster than earlier standards like 802.11n and 802.11g. These routers can also connect to multiple devices at the same time instead of switching between devices.\nThe same is true for external network adapters used in older laptops. Even if the network adapter isn’t physically broken from prolonged use, it probably uses an old wireless standard or outdated antenna technology. Look at the newer alternatives.\nUpdate the Laptop Software Keep the software on your laptop updated. Network drivers, for example, affect how a laptop connects to the network. Old drivers can reduce the range and speed of the connection.\nUpdate the Router Software Updating the router software when possible is also important. Routers use firmware to stay current, so check the router manufacturer’s website to see if there’s an update for your router that includes enhancements or new features that could boost the laptop’s Wi-Fi range.\nThere are several free programs that update computer drivers.\nUse an External Wi-Fi Adapter If you have an older laptop with a malfunctioning network adapter, or if the laptop’s Wi-Fi is working, an external adapter that plugs in via USB can often improve the range of a laptop.\nExternal network adapters sometimes have antennas that reach the router easier than the internal network card.\nAvoid Frequency Interference Older routers run on the same frequency as many home electronic devices. A microwave oven, cordless phone, or garage door opener that runs on the 2.4 GHz frequency can interfere with a Wi-Fi router signal at that same frequency. Modern routers moved to the 5 GHz frequency to avoid home electronic interference.\nIf your router functions at the 2.4 GHz frequency, change the channel the router operates on to see if that helps the range. Available Wi-Fi channels are 1 through 11, but your router may only use two or three of those. Check the router documentation or the manufacturer’s website to see which channels are recommended for use with your router.\nCheck the Transmission Power Settings The transmission power can be adjusted on some network adapters. If available, this setting is changed through the adapter’s driver interface program, along with other settings such as the wireless profiles and Wi-Fi channel number.\nThe transmission power should be set to the maximum of 100% to ensure the strongest signal possible.\nSpeed Could Be a Factor A network with slow speeds can appear to be broken. If videos buffer while streaming, apps won’t download, or web pages are slow to load, it could be due to the speed that you pay for.\nIf a laptop is in a power-saving mode, this setting might be lowered automatically, which decreases the adapter’s range and signal strength.\nEven if you have upgraded hardware, purchased a fast laptop, and are sitting next to a high-speed router, if the internet speed you pay your ISP for isn’t quick, then everything will seem sluggish.\nContact your ISP to upgrade your bandwidth to something faster. For example, if a speed test site shows that you’re paying for 15 Mbps, upgrade to 20 Mbps, 50 Mbps, or something higher so that your devices have ample bandwidth to connect smoothly.\nIf you pay for lots of bandwidth and there’s no other reason for why you’re not getting those speeds, investigate if there are any apps on your laptop that use large amounts of bandwidth. VPN services, download managers, torrents, and other file-sharing tools often hoard bandwidth. Shut down those apps to instantly boost your laptop’s Wi-Fi.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1467","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-03T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Thomas Rice"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/how-to-improve-the-wi-fi-range-of-a-laptop489873/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Boost Your Laptop's Internet Speed and Range with This Simple Trick!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-03 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 3, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1467 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Thomas Rice</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#environmental-factors-that-affectwi-fi-range>Environmental Factors That Affect Wi-Fi Range</a><ul><li><a href=#router-distance>Router Distance</a></li><li><a href=#weak-signal>Weak Signal</a></li><li><a href=#obstructing-objects>Obstructing Objects</a></li><li><a href=#other-wireless-devices>Other Wireless Devices</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#update-your-equipment-and-software>Update Your Equipment and Software</a><ul><li><a href=#use-a-newer-wi-fi-standard>Use a Newer Wi-Fi Standard</a></li><li><a href=#update-the-laptop-software>Update the Laptop Software</a></li><li><a href=#update-the-router-software>Update the Router Software</a></li><li><a href=#use-an-external-wi-fi-adapter>Use an External Wi-Fi Adapter</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#avoid-frequency-interference>Avoid Frequency Interference</a></li><li><a href=#check-the-transmission-power-settings>Check the Transmission Power Settings</a></li><li><a href=#speed-could-be-a-factor>Speed Could Be a Factor</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Boost Your Laptop&rsquo;s Internet Speed and Range with This Simple Trick!</p><p>Do you ever find yourself frustrated with your slow and spotty internet connection on your laptop?
