As internet browsing continues to evolve, Microsoft Edge has been diligently working to keep up with the changing tide. Recently, Microsoft launched a new and improved version of their browser, called Microsoft Edge Chromium. This new version offers a wide range of features designed to revolutionize your browsing experience. Our team had the opportunity to test out the new Microsoft Edge Chromium version, and we’re excited to share our hands-on review of this updated browser.\nWhat’s New in Microsoft Edge Chromium Version? The new Microsoft Edge Chromium version boasts a range of exciting new features, including:\nEnhanced Security Features One of the best features of the new Microsoft Edge Chromium version is the upgraded security features. The browser offers a host of security options, including enhanced tracking prevention, password manager, and privacy controls.\nImproved Performance The new version of Microsoft Edge Chromium is much faster than its predecessor. The browser offers faster page load times, increased responsiveness, and smoother navigation.\nCross-Platform Support The new Microsoft Edge Chromium version offers cross-platform support, which means you can use the browser on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS devices.\nNew Interface and Customization Features The new Microsoft Edge Chromium version offers a modern and sleek interface, which is easy to navigate. The browser also offers customization options, so you can adjust it to suit your personal preferences.\nOur Hands-On Experience Our team had the opportunity to test the new Microsoft Edge Chromium version, and we were thoroughly impressed by its features and performance. The browser functioned flawlessly and was significantly faster than its predecessor. We were also impressed by its enhanced security features, which offered a range of options to protect our data.\nThe new Microsoft Edge Chromium version also looks impressive, with a modern and sleek interface that is easy to navigate. We appreciate the customization options, which allowed us to tailor the browser to our specific needs.\nOne of the standout features of the browser is its cross-platform support, which means we could use it across different devices. Also, the browser has a built-in password manager that simplifies the process of managing our login credentials.\nOverall, we were impressed by the new Microsoft Edge Chromium version, and we would recommend it to anyone looking for a faster, more secure browsing experience.\nConclusion If you’re looking for a browser that offers enhanced security, improved performance, customization options, and cross-platform support, then the new Microsoft Edge Chromium version is an excellent choice. We hope that our hands-on review has helped you decide to try out the new Microsoft Edge Chromium version and revolutionize your browsing experience.\nMicrosoft’s much anticipated Edge Chromium browser is finally here. While there are many other browsers based on Chromium, the new Edge has been optimized for Windows 10. With an “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em” motto, it looks like the new browser could pose a significant challenge to the decade-old reign of Google Chrome.\nWhether or not it can catch up with Chrome is another matter. Compared to the previous Edge browser, the new Edge is a different beast. It does not feel clunky, unfamiliar or unstable. By capturing the essence of a Chromium build, Microsoft seems to have corrected its previous errors. In fact, not too many people are going to miss the older Edge.\nIn this hands-on review, we will look at why you must give this new browser serious consideration.\n1. Compatibility with Google Chrome For too long, Microsoft browsers have lived under the shadow of their more successful Google counterpart. This explains why the whole design of the New Edge is to assist users migrating from Chrome without hassles. After you download and install the software, you will be immediately asked whether you want to import your entire Chrome profile.\nThe compatibility with Chrome is superb, and you even get a live preview of all the sites and bookmark settings.\nThe new Edge extensions are fully compatible with Chrome extensions, which is again a big plus. Just enable an option called “Allow extensions from other stores,” then visit the Chrome extensions webpage and add any extension to Edge as if you never left Chrome in the first place.\nOf course, Microsoft has its own set of extensions for you to populate Edge with.\n2. UI Appearance The browsing experience on the new Edge does not feel any different from Chrome. Unlike the older Edge, the menu icons have greater space. Every menu option is right where you’d find them in the Chrome browser, which makes the browsing experience very intuitive. Microsoft has finally listened to user feedback and gotten rid of some clunky items which were not very popular, such as Web Notes.\n3. Performance Multitaskers rejoice! If you felt the older Edge was a drain on your time and energy, the new Chromium version will erase those bad memories really quickly. Microsoft has indeed shown remarkable improvement in multi-tabbed performance speed.\nBased on my experience, the new Edge even outdid Google Chrome on CPU performance. The exact same tabs were open on both browsers, and Edge’s CPU utilization was consistently less compared to Chrome. It did consume slightly more memory, but that is nothing compared to the older Edge.\nNote: this result is for a Windows 10 laptop.\nThe new Edge has an option called “Browser Task Manager,” which allows you to keep a tab on the browser windows which are consuming more memory. I had 81 tabs open at one point, and it did not slow down my laptop.\n4. Speed and Stability A routine check at speed-battle.com gave the new Edge a score of 358.19 which is just slightly below Chrome’s 371.87. However, the actual speed doesn’t feel any slower for Edge anymore. The scrolling effort is minimal in all browser windows and tabs.\nThe 4K rendering of YouTube videos on the new Edge browser is a brilliant achievement. The videos stream is as fast as Chrome. You need not visit the YouTube website either as Bing maintains an intuitive collection of related searches of all YouTube videos, which only goes to indicate the level of competition between the two browsers. This is a nice feature which I really like using.\nIn an Acid test, which measures a browser’s animation-rendering capabilities at acidtests.org, the new Edge scored the same (97/100) as Google Chrome. Also, the HTML5 testing score (481) was identical for Version 79 of both browsers. For most practical purposes, Edge is no longer behind Chrome in terms of speed and stability: the gap has been erased for good. 5. Privacy From a privacy standpoint, there is a clearly available option to prevent Microsoft from using your browser history or syncing the account.\nFurther, from “Settings” you can block a majority of trackers using a Strict option.\nFinal Verdict Around a year ago, after a head-to-head performance comparison, we had written off Edge, believing it “has a long way to go before it can catch up with Chrome.” But that was its previous buggy version which will soon be forgotten. The new Microsoft Edge Chromium is the real deal and a pleasant surprise, which you must try to believe.\nPersonally, as a Chrome user for the last twelve years, I am seriously thinking of switching over to Chromium Edge. In fact, as soon as I started writing this article on Chrome, I couldn’t resist finishing the piece on this new browser. With Chromium Edge, scrolling long pages seems less of an effort, as this thing seems naturally designed for Windows laptops. Even with multi-tasking, the CPU load feels light as a feather in comparison to Chrome; and of course, the exact same user experience is a big plus.\nHow has your experience been thus far with Microsoft Chromium Edge?
