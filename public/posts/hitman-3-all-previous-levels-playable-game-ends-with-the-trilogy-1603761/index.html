And when it comes to the Hitman series, fans have been anxiously waiting for Hitman 3 to arrive. And, boy, has it delivered!\nHitman 3 not only closes out the trilogy stunningly but also brings back all past levels of the franchise. Yes, you read that right - you get all of them, this time with enhanced graphics, mechanics, and gameplay.\nTo put it simply, Hitman 3 is a game that is worth the investment. It has everything that you would expect from the franchise: stealth, action, and dark humor. But this time around, you get to revisit some of your favorite levels from the past.\nThe game starts where the last one ended, and it takes you on an adventure with Agent 47, the steely assassin who has become a fan favorite. He’s now on his most challenging mission yet – to eliminate the partners of Providence, a powerful organization. Along the way, he encounters many obstacles and challenges, but you get to help him triumph over them all.\nWhat sets Hitman 3 apart from its predecessors is that it has up-to-date graphics that enhance your experience of playing the game. The characters are more realistic than ever, and the environments are more detailed, making it feel like you are part of the game.\nFurthermore, the mechanics and gameplay have been improved over the years, giving you more control over the direction of the game. You can choose to be silent and stealthy, or you can go guns blazing – the choice is entirely up to you. Each mission is uniquely designed, giving you a different experience every time you play, and the more you play, the more you unlock.\nOverall, Hitman 3 is a game that you won’t regret playing. It’s a fitting finale to a trilogy that has lasted for over 20 years. With its breathtaking graphics, improved mechanics, and ability to revisit past levels, it will keep you coming back for more even after you’ve completed the game. So, if you haven’t already, it’s time to dust off your PS4 or PS5 and give this game a shot – You won’t regret it!\nIn a freshly released video, the developers of IO Interactive gave new details about Hitman 3. Among other things, it was pointed out that we are dealing with the conclusion of the new trilogy, in which all old levels will be playable.\nWith Hitman 3, IO Interactive ends the experiment with the episodic release, as the developer reveals in a recent interview. It also confirms that Hitman 3 serves as a hub to all previous levels.\nIn the current video, one goes into the story around Providence, in which Agent 47 influences and changes the events around the world from the background. It is also mentioned again that this time the story and levels will be much darker and denser. The Dubai Level has already been presented, but you can also look forward to some surprises.\nIn general, you will experience a whole new Hitman level with the possibilities of the PS5 and the Glacier Engine as a drive, with more freedom than ever before to complete your new orders.\nIf that’s not enough, Hitman 3 also gives you access to all previous locations and story content, because in this case the title again serves as a HUB, so you don’t necessarily have to own the first games. All unlocks and progress are also taken from Hitman 2. The ideal opportunity if you have missed this extremely exciting story so far.\nIO Interactive will take over the distribution of Hitman 3 itself this time and will not be represented by a publisher. A path that more and more developers are taking these days.\nRecall that Hitman 3 will be released in January 2021 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC. You can find more details in the video below.\n","wordCount":"690","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-06T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"John Garland"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/hitman-3-all-previous-levels-playable-game-ends-with-the-trilogy-1603761/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You Won't Believe This: Hitman 3 Brings Back All Past Levels & Closes Out the Trilogy!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 6, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;690 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;John Garland</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Title: You Won&rsquo;t Believe This: Hitman 3 Brings Back All Past Levels & Closes Out the Trilogy!</p><p>In the world of gaming, it&rsquo;s always exciting to hear about sequels that take your favorite game franchise to the next level.
