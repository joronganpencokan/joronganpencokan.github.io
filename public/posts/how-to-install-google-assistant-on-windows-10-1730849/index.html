Step 1: Configure the Google Assistant API With this step, you can use Google Assistant on Windows, Mac, or Linux. Just install the python on each of these OS to properly configure Google Assistant API.\nFirst, go to the Google Cloud Platform Console website and click on CREATE PROJECT. Note: You might need to sign in with your Google account.\nName your project appropriately, then click on Create. Note: Make sure to note down the project ID, in our case, its windows10-201802. Wait till your new project is created (you will notice a spinning circle on the bell icon at the top right corner).\nOnce the process is done click on the bell icon and select your project.\nOn the project page, from the left-hand menu, click on APIs \u0026 Services, then select Library.\nOn the library page, search for “Google Assistant” (without quotes) in the search console.\nClick on Google Assistant API search result and then click on Enable.\nNow, from the left-hand menu, click on Credentials, then click “Create credentials” and then select Help me choose.\nChoose the following information on the “Add credentials to your project” screen:\nQuestion: Which API are you using?\nAnswer: Google Assistant API\nQuestion: Where will you be calling the API form?\nAnswer: Other UI (e.g. Windows, CLI tool)\nQuestion: What data will you be accessing?\nAnswer: User data\nAfter answering all of the above questions, click on “What credentials do I need?“.\nSelect Set up consent screen and choose the Application type to Internal. Type the project name in the Application name and click Save.\nAgain, go back to the “Add credentials to your project” screen, then click on Create Credentials and select Help me choose. Follow the same instructions as you did on step 9 and proceed forward.\nNext, type the name of the Client ID (name it anything you like) to create OAuth 2.0 client ID and click on the Create Client ID button.\nClick Done, then open a new tab and go to Activity controls from this link.\nMake sure all the toggles are turned ON and then go back to the Credentials tab.\nClick the download icon in the far right of the screen to download the credentials.\nNote: Save the credentials file somewhere easily accessible.\nStep 2: Install Google Assistant Sample Python Project Press Windows Key + X then select Command Prompt (Admin).\nType the following command into cmd and hit Enter after each one:\npy -m pip install google-assistant-sdk[samples]\nOnce the above command finishes executing, type the below command and hit Enter. pip install –upgrade google-auth-oauthlib[tool]\nNavigate to the JSON file location that you downloaded earlier and right-click on it and select Properties. In the name field, copy the file name and paste it inside notepad.\nNow enter the below command but make sure to replace the “path/to/client_secret_XXXXX.json” with the actual path of your JSON file which you copied above:\ngoogle-oauthlib-tool –client-secrets path/to/client_secret_XXXXX.json –scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/assistant-sdk-prototype –save –headless\nOnce the above command finishes processing, you get a URL as the output. Make sure to copy this URL as you will require it in the next step. Note: Don’t close the Command Prompt just yet.\nOpen your Web browser and navigate to this URL, then select the same Google account that you used to configure the Google Assistant API.\nMake sure to click on Allow to grant the necessary permission to run Google Assitant.\nOn the next page, you will see some code that will be your client’s Access Token.\nNow switch back to the Command prompt and copy this code \u0026 paste it into cmd.
