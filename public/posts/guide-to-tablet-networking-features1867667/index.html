Tablets have become a ubiquitous device that people use to accomplish a variety of tasks. The touch screen interface, portability, and ease of use make them an ideal gadget for communication, gaming, entertainment, and work. However, many tablet users are often unaware of the networking features that these devices have to offer. In this article, we will explore the secret tablet networking features you never knew existed and how you can unlock them.\nThe Power of Wi-Fi Direct Wi-Fi Direct allows two devices to connect directly to each other without the need for a router or a Wi-Fi network. This feature is ideal for transferring large files, sharing content, and playing games. You can activate Wi-Fi Direct on your tablet by going to the settings and selecting “Wi-Fi Direct.” From here, you can search for other devices nearby that are also in Wi-Fi Direct mode.\nBluetooth Tethering Bluetooth Tethering allows you to share your tablet’s internet connection with other devices that have Bluetooth connectivity. It is an ideal feature to use when you are on the go and do not have access to a Wi-Fi network. To enable Bluetooth Tethering on your tablet, go to the settings and select “Tethering and Hotspot,” then turn on Bluetooth Tethering.\nNFC (Near Field Communication) Near Field Communication is a technology that allows two devices to communicate with each other when they are in close proximity. You can use NFC to transfer small amounts of data, such as a contact card, a web page URL, or a file between two devices quickly. To enable NFC on your tablet, go to the settings and select “NFC and Payment,” then turn on NFC.\nUSB Tethering USB Tethering allows you to share your tablet’s internet connection with other devices that have a USB port. It is an ideal feature to use when you are on the go and do not have access to a Wi-Fi network or Bluetooth connectivity. To enable USB Tethering on your tablet, go to the settings and select “Tethering and Hotspot,” then turn on USB Tethering. You will also need a USB cable to connect the two devices.\nDLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) DLNA is a networking technology that allows you to stream media from one device to another over a home network. You can use DLNA on your tablet to stream music, videos, and photos to other devices that support this technology, such as smart TVs or gaming consoles. To use DLNA on your tablet, you need to connect both devices to the same network, enable DLNA on your tablet, and then search for the other compatible device.\nThe Bottom Line Tablets have become an essential device for communication, entertainment, and productivity. However, many users are unaware of the hidden networking features that these devices have to offer. In this article, we have explored some of the most useful networking features that you can find on your tablet, including Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth Tethering, NFC, USB Tethering, and DLNA. Unlocking these features will help you get the most out of your tablet and make your life more comfortable and convenient.\nAll tablets feature built-in network connectivity, but each device has different capabilities and limitations. Before buying a tablet, make sure you understand the many ways it can connect to the internet and other devices.\nAll Tablets Have Wi-Fi Wi-Fi is the most ubiquitous form of wireless networking technology. Wi-Fi is designed for local area networking, so it alone will not allow you to use the internet. You must first connect to a wireless network that shares a broadband connection or a public hotspot with internet access. Public hotspots are very common in coffee shops, libraries, and airports, so it is generally easy to find a connection.\nInformation in this article applies broadly to a wide range of devices. Check the specifications of individual products before making a purchase.\nThere are multiple Wi-Fi standards, but they are all fairly compatible with one another. Here is a breakdown of the various Wi-Fi standards along with their features:\n802.11ac: Up to 1.3Gbps, 2.4 or 5GHz Band 802.11n: Up to 450Mbps, 2.4 or 5GHz Band 802.11a: Up to 54Mbps, 5GHz Band 802.11g: Up to 54Mbps, 2.4GHz Band 802.11b: Up to 11Mbps, 2.4GHz Band Some Tablets Support MIMO Another feature that can be found in some tablets is called MIMO. This technology allows a tablet to use multiple antennas to provide increased data bandwidth by broadcasting over multiple channels in the Wi-Fi standard. In addition to increased bandwidth, MIMO can also improve the reliability and range of a tablet on Wi-Fi networks. It also allows users to listen to FM radio on a tablet.\nA Few Tablets Support Cellular Wireless Any tablet that offers cellular data will cost more due to the extra necessary transceivers. Once you have the hardware, you must sign up for a data plan with a carrier that is compatible with the tablet.\nMost data plans come with a data cap that limits how much data you can download over that connection in a given month. Carriers do different things once you reach that cap. Some actually stop allowing data to be downloaded, or others might throttle it so that things like streaming video do not function. Some carriers allow you to keep downloading and then charge you overage fees.\nSome “unlimited” data plans still have caps on them that allow downloading up to a certain data amount at the full network speeds. Once that amount has been exceeded, network speeds are significantly reduced. This practice is referred to as data throttling, and it can make comparing data plans difficult as it is not possible to determine how much data you might use before you have the device.\nBluetooth and Tethering Bluetooth is the primary means for connecting wireless peripherals such as keyboards or headsets to ​mobile devices. The technology can also be used for transferring files directly between devices.\nIt is possible to reduce the cost of the hardware through rebate offers when you sign up with a carrier for an extended contract.\nTethering is a method of linking a mobile device, such as a laptop or tablet, with a mobile phone to share the wireless broadband connection. This can theoretically be done with any device that offers wireless broadband and Bluetooth support; however, some wireless carriers charge an extra fee to unlock this feature. If you are interested in tethering, check with the wireless carrier and the device manufacturer to ensure that it is possible before buying any hardware.\nMobile Hotspots Wireless base stations, or mobile hotspots, let you connect a wireless router to a high-speed network and share the connection with other devices that have standard Wi-Fi. Some tablets with 4G and 5G technology can be used as a hotspot for other Wi-Fi enabled devices. These devices also require a data contract with a carrier.\nNear Field Communications NFC, or near field communications, is a short-range networking technology. It allows for the transfer of data between two devices without using the internet. The most common use for NFC right now is mobile payment systems such as Apple Pay, but it is also used for syncing and sharing files with PCs and other tablets.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1224","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-28T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Eleanor Sibbett"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/guide-to-tablet-networking-features1867667/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock the Secret Tablet Networking Features You Never Knew Existed with This Ultimate Guide!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 28, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1224 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Eleanor Sibbett</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#the-power-of-wi-fi-direct>The Power of Wi-Fi Direct</a></li><li><a href=#bluetooth-tethering>Bluetooth Tethering</a></li><li><a href=#nfc-near-field-communication>NFC (Near Field Communication)</a></li><li><a href=#usb-tethering>USB Tethering</a></li><li><a href=#dlna-digital-living-network-alliance>DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance)</a></li><li><a href=#the-bottom-line>The Bottom Line</a></li><li><a href=#all-tablets-have-wi-fi>All Tablets Have Wi-Fi</a></li><li><a href=#some-tablets-support-mimo>Some Tablets Support MIMO</a></li><li><a href=#a-few-tablets-support-cellular-wireless>A Few Tablets Support Cellular Wireless</a></li><li><a href=#bluetooth-and-tethering>Bluetooth and Tethering</a></li><li><a href=#mobile-hotspots>Mobile Hotspots</a></li><li><a href=#near-field-communications>Near Field Communications</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=unlock-the-secret-tablet-networking-features-you-never-knew-existed-with-this-ultimate-guide>Unlock the Secret Tablet Networking Features You Never Knew Existed with This Ultimate Guide!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#unlock-the-secret-tablet-networking-features-you-never-knew-existed-with-this-ultimate-guide>#</a></h1><p>Tablets have become a ubiquitous device that people use to accomplish a variety of tasks.
