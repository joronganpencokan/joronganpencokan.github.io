PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds or PUBG is one of the most popular and competitive online battle royale games in the world. It has a huge fan base and millions of players all around the globe. Recently, PUBG launched an updated version of their Miramar Map, which has given players a new opportunity to explore and dominate the landscape.\nIf you’re one of those players looking to dominate this new and improved Miramar Map 2.0, then this ultimate guide is for you. After playing multiple rounds, analyzing gameplay, and studying the in-game data, we have curated the best tips and tricks to help you become the ultimate champion.\n1. Know the Map\nThe first and foremost step to becoming a master of any map is familiarizing yourself with it. Explore the map by landing in different areas, taking note of high activity zones, and identifying chokepoints. In Miramar 2.0, there is an additional feature of Springs, which is very important to map knowledge as they offer loot and easy access to other parts of the map.\nAnother important feature of the map is that as the game progresses, the blue circle will start to cover a larger area of the map, so you definitely want to know the safest and quickest routes from one zone to another.\n2. Utilize Vehicles\nWith Miramar 2.0, the developers have introduced multiple new terrain types, which include mountainous regions and water bodies, making vehicles an important tool for transportation. It is essential to know which vehicles spawn where and how they move on the terrain. Vehicles can also help you reach high-risk zones like the new Oasis Pueblo, located at the southeast end of the map.\nHowever, keep in mind that vehicles make a lot of noise, and enemies can easily spot you if you’re driving one. Use them strategically and camp around the outskirts of the circle to avoid any unwanted attention.\n3. Choose Your Gear Wisely\nThe Miramar 2.0 update has brought several new weapons and attachments that can help you win battles, including the Mosin Nagant sniper rifle and a sawed-off shotgun. However, it’s important to choose your gear wisely, depending on your playstyle.\nFor instance, if you’re good at long-range sniping, the Mosin Nagant is a great choice, but if you prefer close-range combat, you might want to equip attachments like the tactical stock or red-dot sights on weapons such as the Uzi, Kar98k, or XM1014.\n4. Master the Blue Zone\nAs mentioned earlier, the blue zone in Miramar 2.0 starts to cover more area as the game progresses. To master the blue zone, you need to know your limits and how to navigate it to your advantage. Be sure to keep your health up and use medkits and energy drinks when needed. Know when you need to move from one zone to another and when to stay put and camp around the edges of the blue zone.\n5. Use High Ground to Your Advantage\nMiramar 2.0 now has more elevated regions, which make for great vantage points. Use these high grounds to spot enemies moving in the open or to ambush players who are caught in a firefight. Keep in mind that enemies can come from any direction, so keep your ears open and be quick to react if you spot someone.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe new and improved Miramar Map 2.0 is a great addition to the already impressive PUBG roster, but it can be overwhelming for players unfamiliar with its geography. By following these tips and understanding the terrain, you’ll be a pro in no time. Remember, practice makes perfect, and with time, you’ll be dominating Miramar 2.0 like a true champion. Good luck out there!\nPUBG Mobile releases its new update patch 0.18.0 in May 2020. This update brings a significant amount of new features to the game – modes, weapons, scopes, landscapes, skins, anti-cheat system as well as the widely popular Miramar Map gets a fresh new upgrade 2.0. Stunning new landscapes, detailed architectures, new tracks, and a golden surprise. Read along to find out more.\nMad Miramar 2.0 New Racetracks – With this cool new feature, PUBG has redefined the concept of Battle Royales. Throughout the Mad Miramar Map, you can locate slopes and rolled-up ramps to perform airborne stunts with your vehicles. While this does not contribute anything to the actual gameplay, you can always have some fun along the way. The Ruins – You have a new raid spot on the northwest corner of the Miramar 2.0 – the ruins are every bit aesthetic to the overall landscape of the desert. Located in a remote location, there are chances that players will focus their landings here to fill up on ammunition before entering the bloodshed. The Oasis – If The Ruins were not enough, you now have an oasis in the northwest part of the Miramar 2.0 as well. And strangely enough, this deserted area will be teeming with players searching for weapons and not water. Sandstorms – Keeping to the tradition, we have a new sandstorm effect in Miramar 2.0 just like we have blizzards in the new Arctic mode of Vikendi map. Sandstorms can originate at any place on the map any time, and this is where players are expected to show their creativity in ambushes and strategic positioning to incur maximum damage to their enemies while hidden in the storm. The Surprise – And finally the golden surprise of Miramar 2.0, the stunning Golden Mirado. The newest addition to PUBGs garage, the Golden Mirado is a vintage beauty that will most definitely be fought for. And to no surprise, finding the Mirado will be a tough task, it can be spawned at exactly one specific location of Miramar 2.0 How to get the Golden Mirado in PUBG? You will require the new update 0.18.0 to unlock the Mad Miramar 2.0 map. Once inside, start the game and during the drop-off, mark Hacienda del Patron on the map. Land on this location and reach the tallest building you can see there. Enter the garage of that building and click on the smiley icon at the top of your screen. You get 4 dance moves in that, do them and clap, wave, and throw kisses at your sweet new ride standing strong right in front of you (you can ignore the dancing part if you’re in a hurry of course) There you have your very own Golden Mirado. But be careful as well as swift on your feet, chances are that you might encounter your enemies all at once, after all, who doesn’t want to lay hands on this golden beauty. These are all the new features of The Mad Miramar 2.0 which you can unlock for free after updating your PUBG: Mobile with the 0.18.0 patch. If you are a devoted player of this game, these PUBG: Mobile guides will most definitely come handy.\n","wordCount":"1169","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Arlene Laurie"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/guide-to-the-all-new-miramar-map-2-0-pubg-502086/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joronganpencokan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://joronganpencokan.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Joronganpencokan (Alt + H)"><img src=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Joronganpencokan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://joronganpencokan.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unleash Your Inner Champion with the Ultimate Guide to Dominating the New and Improved Miramar Map 2.0 in PUBG!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 18, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1169 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Arlene Laurie</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#mad-miramar-20>Mad Miramar 2.0</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-get-the-golden-mirado-in-pubg>How to get the Golden Mirado in PUBG?</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=unleash-your-inner-champion-with-the-ultimate-guide-to-dominating-the-new-and-improved-miramar-map-20-in-pubg>Unleash Your Inner Champion with the Ultimate Guide to Dominating the New and Improved Miramar Map 2.0 in PUBG!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#unleash-your-inner-champion-with-the-ultimate-guide-to-dominating-the-new-and-improved-miramar-map-20-in-pubg>#</a></h1><p>PlayerUnknown&rsquo;s Battlegrounds or PUBG is one of the most popular and competitive online battle royale games in the world.
