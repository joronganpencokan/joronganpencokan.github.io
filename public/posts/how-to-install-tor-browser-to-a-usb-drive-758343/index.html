The government and corporations alike track our every move online, often without our knowledge or consent. The good news is that there are ways to protect your data and stay anonymous on the internet, one of which is through the use of Tor browser. In this article, we’ll take you through the steps of installing Tor browser on your USB drive, so you can always have it with you and never be tracked again!\nWhat is Tor Browser?\nTor stands for “The Onion Router.” It is a free and open-source software that was initially designed for the U.S. Navy to protect government communication. Tor reroutes your internet traffic through a series of servers, making it difficult for anyone to trace your online activity back to you. Tor also allows you to access websites that may be blocked in your region or country, making it a popular tool for activists and journalists around the world.\nWhy Install Tor Browser on Your USB Drive?\nInstalling Tor browser on your USB drive provides a number of benefits. Firstly, it means you can access Tor on any computer you use, without leaving any trace of your activity on that computer. Secondly, it allows you to easily switch between using Tor and a regular browser, depending on your needs at the time. Finally, it ensures that your Tor browser is always up to date with the latest security features.\nHow to Install Tor Browser on Your USB Drive\nDownload the Tor Browser for your operating system (Windows, Mac or Linux) from the official website: https://www.torproject.org/download/.\nInsert your USB drive into your computer and extract the contents of the Tor Browser download to a new folder on your USB drive.\nOpen the folder and double-click on the file “Start Tor Browser.”\nThe Tor Browser will launch, and you can start browsing the web anonymously.\nWhen you’re finished using Tor, simply close the browser and remove your USB drive from the computer.\nCongratulations! You have successfully installed Tor Browser on your USB drive and can now access the internet anonymously and securely from any computer.\nTips for Using Tor Browser\nBe aware that while Tor will hide your online activity, it will not protect you from malware or viruses. Make sure you have up-to-date antivirus software installed on your computer.\nRemember that not all websites are safe to visit, even when using Tor. Stick to reputable websites and avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading files from unknown sources.\nBe patient - Tor can be slower than regular browsing due to the rerouting of your traffic through multiple servers.\nIf you’re using Tor for sensitive activities, such as activism or journalism, consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) in addition to Tor for extra protection.\nConclusion\nTor Browser is a powerful tool for online privacy and anonymity. By installing it on your USB drive, you can access it from any computer and ensure that your online activity is always secure and private. Remember to follow the tips for safe browsing, and always stay up to date with the latest security features. With Tor Browser on your USB drive, you’ll never have to worry about being tracked again!\nNow that Congress allows your Internet Service provider to sell your private information without your permission, almost everyone in the United States is talking about online privacy. With tech jargon words like Virtual Private Network, encryption, and tunnelling, it can be hard to make sense of it all. Regardless of whether you’re a pro or a noob, anyone with a passing interest in online privacy has undoubtedly heard of Tor. As much as “Mr. Robot” would like you to think of Tor as something only vigilante cyberspace revolutionaries would make use of, the truth is that anyone can use it, and almost everyone would benefit from it.\nWhat Is Tor? Simply put, Tor is software developed by a non-profit organization that allows a user to browse the Internet anonymously. Without getting too technical, Tor accomplishes this by re-routing all of your Internet traffic through a series of relays all around the world. Each one of these “relays” is a computer that runs special software that allows a user to connect to the Tor network. When using the Tor browser, your traffic will connect to several different relays. Each time it connects to a relay, information that can reveal your identity or location is wiped.\nThis is beneficial for three reasons. First, anyone with prying eyes who may be watching your Internet connection (like your ISP), can’t see what sites you visit. Second, it prevents the sites you visit from collecting information about you, like your physical location. Third, it lets you bypass sites that may be blocked. This is handy for people who have limited or even censored Internet access.\nInstalling and Getting Started If the idea of your ISP spying on you creeps you out or you simply want to avoid your workplace’s pesky web restrictions, Tor can help. First, download the Tor browser. It is a modified version of Firefox that has been pre-configured to connect to the Tor network. After downloading the bundle, the installer will ask you where you would like to install the Tor browser. You can choose to stick it anywhere, but we recommend installing it to a spare USB drive. Doing so will allow you to launch the Tor browser straight from the USB without it having to integrate with your Windows operating system.\nThere are two main benefits to installing Tor to a USB drive. First, since it runs off of the USB and not the computer itself, there is literally no trace of Tor or your browsing history present anywhere on the PC. Secondly, this makes your Tor browser completely portable: simply take it with you and launch from any Windows machine.\nNote: some people may wish to verify the signature of the Tor installer. If you suspect that someone might want to give you a fake version of Tor, you’ll probably want to do this. If so, the Tor Project website has detailed instructions on how to do so.\nUsing the Tor Browser After installation, you will see a “Tor Browser” folder on the root directory of your USB. Inside that folder you will find the “Start Tor browser” EXE file. Double-clicking on that will launch the Tor browser application. A normal browser would then allow you to surf the Web to your heart’s content. With Tor, however, there are a few fiddly things you need to get out of the way first.\nUpon first launch, a window will pop up asking you if you would like to connect to the Tor network directly or if you want to configure proxy settings. For most people, a direct connection is fine. If you run a VPN, you’re going to have to choose the latter. Once that’s out of the way, a modified version of Firefox will launch, and you’ll be able to jump in. While using Tor with the default settings is certainly more secure than virtually any other browser, you can tweak Tor to maximize its effectiveness.\nChange Your Security Settings Within Tor You can increase your security level by clicking the green onion icon next to the address bar. In the box that appears, select “Privacy and Security Settings.” You’ll see a “Security Level” slider. The default setting is “Low,” but you can increase it. In doing so you will increase your anonymity; however, the trade-off is that you will disable some of the features associated with web browsing. Here is a breakdown of what happens at each security level.\nHigh – JavaScript is disabled on all sites by default. Some types of images are disabled. Medium-High – All JavaScript performance optimizations are disabled. Some font rendering features are disabled. JavaScript is disabled on all non-HTTPS sites by default. Medium-Low – HTML5 video and audio are click-to-play. Some JavaScript performance optimizations are disabled. Remote JAR files are blocked, and some methods to display math equations are disabled. Low (default) – All browser features are enabled. Limitations of Using Tor Tor allows you to browse in relative anonymity by redirecting your traffic through various relays. This means that data you send or receive through your computer will have to travel much further, which means that you can expect an overall slower online experience. In addition, only traffic direct from the Tor browser will run through the Tor network. This means that data routed through any other Internet-connected application does not and can be seen by advertisers, the government or anyone else who wants to have a peek.\nUltimately, Tor is only as secure as the person using it. While it helps to mask your identity, Tor does not protect you from malicious software like viruses or malware. The Tor Project also highly recommends that you rethink your browsing habits. Using search engines that don’t collect data and avoiding browser extensions that can potentially leak your IP address are all good places to start.\nDo you use Tor? If so, do you have any other additional tips to help protect your privacy? Are you concerned with Internet anonymity and privacy? Why or why not?
