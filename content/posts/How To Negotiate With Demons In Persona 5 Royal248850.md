Persona 5 Royal is the enhanced and expanded version of the well-received Persona 5 game. It offers hours of addictive gameplay, a deep and engaging storyline, and engaging combat mechanics that make the game challenging and exciting. One of the key features that make Persona 5 Royal unique is its demon negotiation system. In this guide, we will delve into the secrets of negotiating with demons and unleash your inner devil!

The Negotiation System in Persona 5 Royal

The demon negotiation system in Persona 5 Royal is a crucial element of the game. Every time you encounter a demon in the game, you have the option to negotiate with it. If you manage to convince the demon to join your party, you will gain a powerful ally that can help you in combat. However, if your negotiation fails, the demon will attack you, and you will need to defeat it in battle.

The negotiation process involves selecting dialogue options that can sway the demon to your side. Each demon has a unique personality and preference, so you need to understand their likes and dislikes to increase your chance of success. For example, some demons may prefer a straightforward approach, while others may prefer sarcasm or flattery.

Tips for Negotiating with Demons

Here are some tips that can help you negotiate with demons in Persona 5 Royal.

1. Understand the Demon's Personality

As mentioned earlier, every demon has a unique personality that determines its likes and dislikes. Some demons may have an aggressive nature, while others may be passive or even friendly. Understanding the demon's personality can give you an insight into the dialogue options that are more likely to succeed.

2. Use the Right Tone

The tone of your voice during the negotiation process can make a significant difference in the outcome. Using a calm and collected tone can persuade a demon to join your party, while a harsh or aggressive tone may make the demon hostile. Keep in mind that different demons may respond differently to different tones, so experiment to see what works best.

3. Offer Something Valuable

Most demons in Persona 5 Royal have an agenda that they want to fulfill. Offering something that the demon values, such as rare items or persona, can make the negotiation process easier. However, keep in mind that some demons may be greedy and demand more than what you are willing to offer.

4. Know When to Walk Away

Not every negotiation will be successful, and sometimes it's better to cut your losses and walk away. Trying to negotiate with a stubborn demon can waste valuable time and resources. Knowing when to give up and move on to the next encounter can help you progress faster and avoid unnecessary frustration.
