Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, and Facebook is one of the most commonly used platforms. With billions of posts shared every day, it can be overwhelming to keep up with all the updates from your friends and family. From political rants to ads and memes, your Facebook feed can quickly become cluttered with irrelevant content. But fear not, there is a way to filter out the noise and focus on what matters most - seeing updates from your loved ones.

Here are some tips to help you create a happier Facebook feed:

1. Unfollow or Mute Irrelevant Pages

One of the easiest ways to declutter your Facebook feed is to unfollow or mute pages that are no longer relevant to you. Whether it's an old high school friend who constantly shares negative news articles or a business that you no longer want to follow, unfollowing or muting them will ensure that their posts no longer appear in your feed.

To unfollow a page, simply go to the page, click on the three dots on the top right corner of the page, and select "Unfollow." If you don't want to unfollow completely but want to see fewer posts from them, select "See First."

2. Prioritize Posts from Friends and Family

Facebook has a feature that allows you to prioritize the posts you see from your friends and family. By selecting this option, you'll see their posts first in your feed, giving you a better chance to keep up with their updates.

To prioritize posts from friends and family, go to your settings, click on "News Feed Preferences," and select "Prioritize Who to See First." From there, choose the people you want to prioritize in your feed.

3. Utilize Lists to Sort Your Friends

Lists are a great way to sort your friends on Facebook. You can create lists for different categories, such as family, close friends, or coworkers. By organizing your list of friends, you can easily filter your feed to see updates only from the people in that category.

To create a list, go to your settings, click on "News Feed Preferences," and select "Unfollowed." From there, select "Create List" and add the people you want to categorize.

4. Hide Posts from Certain Users

If there's someone in your friend list who constantly posts irrelevant or negative content, you can easily hide their posts. By doing this, their posts will no longer appear in your feed.

To hide posts from a user, simply click on the three dots on the top right corner of the post and select "Hide post." From there, Facebook will give you the option to hide all future posts from that user.

In conclusion, Facebook can be a great way to stay connected with friends and family, but it can also be overwhelming with all the irrelevant content on your feed. By utilizing these tips, you can declutter your feed and focus on the updates that matter most to you. Start today and create a happier Facebook feed.

In a few weeks, you can quickly go from a carefully curated thread of acquaintances and relatives to a cluster of promoted content, irrelevant group updates and suggestions for things that don’t interest you.
Luckily, there is something that you can do about it. Read on for a new way just to see content from people who matter the most.

 
## Here’s the backstory


If you are old enough to remember Facebook’s launch and the heightened competition with Myspace, you probably added everybody you could think of, even distant relatives and vague acquaintances.
It wasn’t much of a problem then, but the homepage feeds became messy as Facebook attracted more people (it has 2.9 billion users today). Also, with the addition of groups, their updates, and sponsored content, posts can quickly get overwhelming.   
To make matters worse, Facebook feeds work on an algorithm to show content it thinks you want to see and not in chronological order. But how do you cut through the clutter to see more relevant posts?

 
## What you can do about it


You can force your feed to show posts chronologically if you are on a desktop. It’s a great option, but it’s not permanent. Every time you open your feed, you’ll have to make the change. On the left panel, click on See More, scroll down and then click on Most Recent.
But the most significant change is an update to the mobile app. Facebook is testing out more ways to control your feed better. This includes setting up favorites, easier access to snoozing people and pages, and unfollowing people, pages and groups.
When you add people to your favorites list, their posts get priority in the news feed over everything else. After the app update, you have three feed options:

 
Home feed, which shows the most relevant posts first.Favorites, which only shows posts from your selected favorite people.Recent, which shows you any new posts first.


Favorites is a collection of posts from friends and pages that you choose, and you’ll see all their posts first from the last three days. During the setup process, Facebook will suggest 10 friends. But if you want to add anybody that isn’t on the list, tap on Search and enter their name.
Now, whenever you open the Facebook app, you see Your Feed, Favorites and Recent in the top banner. Just tap on any button, and you’ll see the associated feed. To make any changes to your feed settings, tap on the Settings button in the top banner and then tap on Manage Your Feed.
Don’t forget to add the Komando Facebook page to your Favorites list so you never miss a tech update and the latest news.
