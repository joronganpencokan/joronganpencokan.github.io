# "Unlock The Full Potential Of Your Android Device With This Secret Ram Boosting Trick - Guaranteed To Blow Your Mind!"

Are you tired of your Android device slowing down while running multiple applications? Do you feel like you're not getting the most out of your device? If so, then you need to know about a secret trick that will unlock the full potential of your Android device.

With this simple trick, you'll be able to boost your device's RAM and improve its performance, allowing you to run multiple applications without any lag or slowdown. So, without further ado, let's get started!

## Step 1: Enable Developer Options

To access the hidden features that we're going to be using, you need to first enable the Developer Options on your Android device. To do this, go to your device settings and scroll down to "About phone" or "About device." From there, tap on "Build number" or "Build version" seven times until you see the message "You are now a developer!"

## Step 2: Enable "Force GPU rendering" and "Disable HW overlays"

Once you've enabled Developer Options, go back to the main Settings menu and select "Developer options." From there, scroll down until you see the options "Force GPU rendering" and "Disable HW overlays." Enable both of these options.

Enabling "Force GPU rendering" will force your device to use the GPU (graphics processing unit) for rendering, improving performance in graphics-intensive applications. Enabling "Disable HW overlays" will disable hardware overlays and allow your device to use software rendering instead, which can also improve performance.

## Step 3: Enable "Limit Background Processes"

Another setting that can be adjusted to improve performance on your Android device is "Limit Background Processes." This setting limits the number of background processes that can run at any given time, freeing up RAM for other applications.

To enable this setting, go back to the Developer Options menu and select "Limit Background Processes." From there, select "No background processes."

## Step 4: Use "Greenify" to hibernate applications

Now that you've optimized your device's settings, you can take it a step further by hibernating applications that are not in use. This is where "Greenify" comes in handy.

Greenify is a free app that helps you hibernate applications that you don't use often, freeing up valuable RAM and improving battery life. To use Greenify, simply install the app from the Google Play Store and select which applications you want to hibernate.

## Step 5: Enjoy your newly optimized Android device!

Congratulations, you've successfully unlocked the full potential of your Android device! With these simple tricks, you'll be able to run multiple applications without any lag or slowdown. So go ahead and enjoy your newly optimized device!

In conclusion, with this secret Ram Boosting trick, you'll be able to unlock the full potential of your Android device. By enabling Developer Options, optimizing your settings, and using Greenify, you can significantly improve the performance and overall user experience of your device. So don't wait any longer, give this trick a try today and see the difference for yourself!

Most of the Android devices nowadays comes with at least 8 GB to 16 GB of storage space but only 1 GB of RAM. This is enough for most of the operations that your device performs but what if you can increase the RAM? Physically this is not possible for us to increase RAM like we do it on our PC but what we can do is “swap” i.e. add an area in storage to be used as a RAM. With additional RAM, many activities which would run slow previously could run faster. However your device must be rooted for this to work. Here’s how to increase RAM on Android device.
 
## How to increase RAM on Android device
 
First of all you have to make sure your device’s kernel is swap compatible. Download Memory info and Swapfile Check app to check your device’s compatibility. Once you finished installing the app, open it and tap on Start RAMEXPANDER Test Here and select the SD card. If your device is compatible, you will get a Congratulations message. Now you can install the Ram Expander app. It is not free and will cost you $10.10 (price at the time of writing this article).Once the app is installed, run it. It may ask for root permission and ask you to select preferred language. You will now have to adjust the size of SD card and use slider to allocate the RAM size. If you are not confident about this, you can simply tap on Optimal Value and let the app decide the RAM size for you. When you are happy with the swap size, tap the Swap Activ button. Make sure you enable Autorun so that you don’t have to repeat the steps all over again after you reboot your device.This is it. This is how you can increase your android device’s RAM. I recommend you to buy the fasted SD card on the market to use for swapping for best performance. Also, the new devices have adequate RAM to run your phone smoothly so use this trick to make your old androids with very low RAM to run faster.
