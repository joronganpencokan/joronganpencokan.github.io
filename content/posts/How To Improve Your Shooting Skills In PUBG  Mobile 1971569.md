Introduction:

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, commonly known as PUBG, is one of the most popular online multiplayer games available today. With game modes like Solo, Duo, and Squad, it allows players to form a team and fight against others in a battle for survival. However, winning Squad matches on PUBG Mobile can be challenging, as players need to be skillful and accurate shooters to dominate their opponents. In this article, we will unlock the secret to dominate your PUBG Mobile squad with these epic shooting techniques.

Epic Shooting Techniques:

1. Mastering the basics:

As basic as it may sound, mastering the basics of shooting in PUBG Mobile is necessary. It involves knowing how to aim correctly, maintaining a stable grip, and firing accurately. One of the best practices is to keep the crosshair on the target to improve the chances of shooting accurately. Also, it is essential to hold the gun with both hands and use the gun attachment for better stability.

2. Take cover:

Taking cover is an essential tactic in Squad matches to protect the team from enemy fire. Always take cover behind walls, rocks, trees, or any object that can protect you from bullets. When shooting, it is best to peek from the cover and aim at the enemy's head or body. It gives the chance to aim accurately and shoot accurately, increasing the chances of downing the opponent.

3. Use Grenades Strategically:

Grenades are powerful weapons that can take out the entire enemy squad if used strategically. The game has three types of grenades, including frag, smoke, and stun grenades, each with its function. Frag grenades can eliminate enemy squads, while smoke grenades can be used to create cover and confusion, while stun grenades can stun enemies, giving an advantage to take them out.

4. Use the terrain to your advantage:

Every map in PUBG has different terrain features that can offer an edge to teams using them. For example, hills can provide better vantage points, while buildings can offer cover and protection. Use high terrain to peek at the enemy and shoot in areas where enemies cannot see you, such as prone position, bushes, and trees.

5. Communicate with your squad:

Communication is key to winning in Squad matches. Using the in-game voice chat, communicate with your team in real-time, informing them about your movements, enemy locations, or when to attack. It helps in situational awareness and coordination, making it easier for the team to dominate.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, these epic shooting techniques can help you dominate the Squad matches in PUBG Mobile. Mastering the basics, taking cover, using grenades strategically, using terrain to your advantage, and communicating with your squad are essential tactics to succeed. The game requires a lot of practice and patience, but using these techniques can improve your gameplay and lead your team to victory. With these tips, you will be able to unlock the secrets to dominate your PUBG Mobile squad in no time!
