If you are someone who constantly looks for ways to customize and personalize your Windows 10 desktop experience, you may have noticed the centered taskbar icons in the new Windows 11 update. While not everyone likes this change, it has definitely caught the attention of many users who want to achieve the same look on their computers. 

Previously, in Windows 10, the taskbar icons were aligned to the left by default. But with some tweaks and adjustments, you can now center them just like in Windows 11. In this article, we'll unlock the secret to perfectly centered taskbar icons on Windows 10.

## 1. Using TaskbarX

TaskbarX is a free third-party utility that can be used to center taskbar icons in Windows 10. It is a simple-to-use solution and requires no coding knowledge to set up. You can download TaskbarX from the official website, and once it's installed, follow these steps:

1. Launch TaskbarX.
2. Click on "Settings" and select "Taskbar" from the menu.
3. In the "Alignment" section, choose "Centered."
4. Customize the other settings to your liking.

That's it! TaskbarX will automatically center the icons for you. You can also set up hotkeys to move the taskbar icons to a preferred position - this is useful when you need the icons on the left or right side of the taskbar temporarily.

## 2. Using Registry Editor

Another way to center taskbar icons is by editing the registry, which is a more technical route. Ensure that you back up your registry before making any changes to avoid losing important data or causing system errors. Follow these steps:

1. Press "Windows key + R" to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type "regedit" (without the quotes) and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor.
3. Navigate to "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\WindowMetrics."
4. Find "MinWidth" and double-click on it.
5. Change the default value data from "-255" to "0" and click OK.
6. Right-click on the taskbar and select "Task Manager." 
7. In the Task Manager, end the "Windows Explorer" process by right-clicking it and selecting "End Task."
8. Click "File" in the Task Manager's menu, then "Run new task."
9. Type "explorer" and click OK to restart the Windows Explorer process.
10. The taskbar icons will now be centered.

## Conclusion

Windows 11's centered taskbar icons have since become a popular trend, and the good news is that you can easily achieve the same look on Windows 10 with a few tweaks. While there are several third-party programs that can help you center the taskbar icons, we recommend using TaskbarX for its simplicity and ease of use. However, if you're comfortable working with the registry editor, you can follow the steps outlined above to achieve the same result.
