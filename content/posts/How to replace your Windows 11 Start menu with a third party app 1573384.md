Say Goodbye to Boring Start Menus for Good with This Easy Hack for Windows 11!

If you're anything like me, you've probably spent more time than you care to admit scrolling through your Windows Start menu, searching for programs and apps. And let's be honest, the default Windows Start menu can be pretty dull and uninspiring. But fear not, because with Windows 11, there's a new hack that can take your Start menu from boring to exciting in just a few simple steps.

First, you'll need to launch the Windows 11 Start menu. You can do this by pressing the Windows key on your keyboard or by clicking the Start button in the bottom left corner of your screen. Once you've opened the Start menu, you'll notice that it looks a little different than previous versions of Windows. The new Start menu is designed to be more streamlined, with a focus on productivity and ease of use.

But if you're looking for a bit more personality in your Start menu, then it's time to hack it. The first step is to download a program called Open-Shell. This is a free and open-source program that allows you to customize your Start menu in a myriad of ways.

Once you've downloaded and installed Open-Shell, launch the program and select the "Start Menu Style" tab. From here, you can choose from a variety of different Start menu styles, including the classic Windows 7-style Start menu, a Windows 10-style menu, and more. You can also choose to add custom buttons, change the appearance of the Start menu, and more.

One of the best features of Open-Shell is that it allows you to add your own custom shortcuts to the Start menu. This means that you can add links to your favorite websites, frequently used apps, and more. To do this, simply right-click on the Start menu and select "Open-Shell Settings." From here, select "Customize Start Menu" and then "Add Custom Shortcut." You can then enter the name of the program or website you want to add, as well as the path to the program or URL.

Another great feature of Open-Shell is its ability to create custom Start menu groups. This means that you can organize your programs into categories, making it easier to find what you're looking for. To create a custom group, simply right-click on the Start menu and select "Open-Shell Settings." From here, select "Customize Start Menu" and then "New Group." You can then give your group a name and drag and drop programs into it.

In conclusion, if you're tired of the boring and uninspired default Windows 11 Start menu, then it's time to try out Open-Shell. With a few simple steps, you can customize your Start menu to better suit your needs, and add some personality to your desktop. Give it a try, and see just how much more exciting your Windows 11 Start menu can be!

Well, if you hate the new Start menu in Windows 11 as much as I do and want something more usable and customizable, your best bet is to switch to a Start menu replacement.
Several third-party apps can replace the Windows 11 Start menu with a more familiar look and layout and a variety of ways to customize it. The program I use on my Windows 11 machines is Start11.Â 
But there are other utilities worth checking out as well, including StartAllBack and Open Shell Menu. Here's how to get the Windows 11 Start menu you deserve.

## Start11


Priced at $5.99 for a single license, Stardock's Start11 lets you choose from among four different Start menu layouts. The Windows 7 and Modern styles offer the traditional two-column display with all apps or favorite apps on the left and shortcuts to different Windows features and locations on the right. A Windows 10 style uses the familiar menu and tiled screen combination. There's even a Windows 11 style, but one that provides more features and flexibility than the built-in menu. I've always liked the two-column display, so I use the Modern style menu.
Whichever menu you choose, you're able to tweak its look, layout, and design. You can opt for a regular menu that uses the full width or a more compact design that shrinks certain items. Further, you're able to configure the all-apps list, add and remove shortcuts, adjust the color and appearance, and determine when and how the Start11 menu is triggered.
Start11 also provides much-needed assistance to the Windows 11 Taskbar, which itself has been criticized for its limitations and lack of flexibility. You can tweak the color and transparency of the Taskbar, adjust its size, choose where it should appear on both a primary and secondary monitor, and decide if and when Taskbar buttons should be combined.
Another bonus is that you can rename, move, and delete folders and shortcuts directly from the Start menu just as Windows long ago allowed you to do. Whether you use Start11 as is or dive into its many customizations, you'll find this a friendly and effective alternative to the regular Windows 11 Start menu.

## StartAllBack


At a cost of $4.99 for one license, StartAllBack is a more basic but still capable Start menu replacement. Right off the bat, the program asks what theme you wish to use for the menu, offering three choices: Proper 11, Kinda 10, and Remastered 7. Despite their names, all three kick in the traditional two-column layout with program shortcuts on the left and Windows features on the right. The differences between them are more aesthetic and depend on whether you prefer rounded or square corners, for example.
After you've picked your preferred theme, head to the Start Menu section in the program to tweak the menu's style, appearance, and functionality. You can control the size of the menu's icons, opt to display modern apps in their own folder, choose to highlight newly installed programs, and set up the shortcuts on the right side as menus or as links.
Like Start11, StartAllBack possesses the power to spruce up the Taskbar. You can pick a custom image for the Start button, select a visual style for the Taskbar, and determine how to combine Taskbar buttons. Best of all, you can position the Taskbar at the top, bottom, left, or right, a capability that Microsoft offers in Windows 10 but killed in Windows 11.
StartAllBack even taps into File Explorer, letting you choose between the Ribbon interface or command bar, turn on the classic search box, and restore the classic context menus from Windows 10. If you want a simple but capable Start menu replacement, StartAllBack is a good choice.

## Open Shell Menu


Though not specifically designed for Windows 11, Open Shell Menu is a free Start menu replacement that works in the new OS with a bit of coaxing. After downloading and installing the program from its GitHub page, you'll need to enable a new Start button to access the menu. To do this, click the regular Windows 11 Start button, go to All Apps, select the folder for Open Shell, and click the shortcut for Open Shell Menu Settings.
At the Settings screen, choose the Start menu layout you prefer -- Classic style with one column, Classic with two columns, or Windows 7 style with two columns. Then check the box for Replace Start button and select one of the built-in images.
While you're at the settings screen, you can tweak many other options: You can determine how to trigger the Open Shell Start menu, show recent or frequently used programs, choose the behavior of the Shut Down button, and opt to display the Search box. Next, you can tweak the skin options to set the size of fonts and icons. A section for Taskbar lets you adjust the size, color, and opacity of the Taskbar. And then you can pick which features you want to see in the Start menu and whether they appear as links or as menus.
To delve even deeper into the program, check the box for "Show all settings" and review the additional options. Otherwise, click the Start button to see the results. Though it's not as polished as Start11 or StartAllBack, the Open Shell menu is certainly worth considering, especially if you're looking for a free Start menu replacement.
