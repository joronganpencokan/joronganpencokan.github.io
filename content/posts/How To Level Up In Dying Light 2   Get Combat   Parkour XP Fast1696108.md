Dying Light 2 is an intense game that demands players to be quick on their feet, make smart decisions, and outmaneuver the zombie hordes that populate the game's world. It's a game that's both exhilarating and challenging, and with the right set of skills, you can level up lightning-fast and become the ultimate survivor in this post-apocalyptic world.

Combat Tips
Combat is an essential part of Dying Light 2, and you need to master it if you want to survive in this world. Here are some pro combat tips that will help you become a fierce survivor:

1. Use weapons smartly - In Dying Light 2, weapons degrade over time, so it's essential to use them wisely. Use your weaker weapons to finish off weaker enemies like biters, and save your stronger weapons for tougher enemies like the infected.

2. Take advantage of your surroundings - The game world is filled with objects that can be used as weapons. You can pick up pipes, bats, and even rocks to use against the zombies. Use your surroundings to your advantage, and you'll have a better chance of surviving.

3. Don't forget to dodge - Dodging is critical in Dying Light 2, especially when you're facing a large group of zombies. Use the dodge button to avoid enemy attacks, and then counter-attack when you have an opening.

Parkour Tips
Parkour is also a crucial part of survival in Dying Light 2. You'll need to navigate the game world quickly and efficiently if you want to stay alive. Here are some pro parkour tips to help you level up:

1. Master the jump - Jumping is a fundamental aspect of parkour in Dying Light 2. You can jump over fences, climb up walls, and even jump from rooftop to rooftop. Master the jump, and you'll be able to navigate the game world quickly and safely.

2. Use the grapple hook - The grapple hook is a new addition to Dying Light 2, and it's an excellent tool for navigating the world quickly. Use it to swing from rooftop to rooftop or to climb up to higher locations.

3. Don't be afraid to experiment - Parkour in Dying Light 2 is all about experimentation. Try different routes, jump from different angles, and use the grapple hook in unique ways. The more you experiment, the better you'll become at parkour.

Conclusion
If you want to level up quickly in Dying Light 2, mastering combat and parkour is essential. Use these pro tips to become a fierce survivor and navigate the game world quickly and safely. With the right set of skills, you'll be able to outmaneuver the zombie hordes and become the ultimate survivor in this post-apocalyptic world. So go ahead, unleash your inner survivor, and show the zombies what you're made of!

 - You will also receive an XP boost as you complete any of the side quests.
