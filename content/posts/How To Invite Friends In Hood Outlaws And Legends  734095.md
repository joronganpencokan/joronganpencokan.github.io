The gameplay is highly addictive, exhilarating, and strategic. But, what is the fun of playing alone when you can dominate the game with your friends! In this article, we will explore how to invite friends in Hood Outlaws and Legends.

Step 1: Find Your Friends

To invite friends in the game, you first need to find them. If your friends are spread across different social platforms, this can be a tricky part. But Hood Outlaws and Legends have made it easier for you by adding the cross-platform feature. All you need to do is search for their usernames on your respective platforms and invite them to play.

Step 2: Create a Private Lobby

To play with your friends exclusively, you need to create a private lobby. Once all your friends accept your invite, create a private lobby. This ensures that only you and your friends are playing in the game.

Step 3: Choose the Game Mode

Hood Outlaws and Legends have three game modes: PVE, PVP, and Heist. Depending on your preference, choose a game mode that suits you and your friends' playstyle. If you want a quick game, PVP is the mode for you. If you like cooperative gameplay, PVE is your best bet. And, if you are up for a challenge, Heist is the mode that you should try.

Step 4: Plan and Strategize

The game is all about planning and strategizing. Assemble your team, plan your approach, and strategize your moves. You and your friends must identify each other's strengths and weaknesses to come up with the best plan.

Step 5: Have Fun!

Last but not least, have fun! Hood Outlaws and Legends is a game that requires a lot of focus and coordination, but it is also meant to be enjoyed. Make sure you and your friends take breaks in between games, keep the mood light, and have fun.

In conclusion, playing with friends in Hood Outlaws and Legends is a thrilling experience. From finding your friends to strategizing the game, it requires teamwork, coordination, and communication. But once you master it, it's a game like no other. So, gather up your friends and start playing! You'll be amazed at the strategies you come up with, the skills you develop, and the fun you have.

This might seem like a bummer but the developers have confirmed this is temporary and they will enable full cross-play very soon. Another point to note is that Play station players won’t be matched with players of other platforms, even during random multiplayer.
