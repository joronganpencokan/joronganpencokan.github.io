SUBTITLE: The Ultimate Guide to Security and Privacy for Your iPad

INTRODUCTION:

iPads have become a part of our daily lives – we use them for work, entertainment, reading, and staying connected with the world. However, with great convenience comes great responsibility. As we carry our iPads with us everywhere, there is a high risk of them being lost or stolen, and our private information being exposed to prying eyes. In this article, we will reveal the shocking truth about how to keep your iPad safe from prying eyes.

BODY:

1. Use a Screen Lock

The first and foremost way to safeguard your iPad is to use a screen lock. You can set up a passcode or use Touch ID or Face ID to prevent unauthorized access to your device. This is a basic but essential step towards securing your iPad, and it takes only a few seconds to set up.

2. Enable Find My iPad

In case your iPad gets lost or stolen, you can use Find My iPad feature to locate it, remotely lock it, or even delete its data. To enable Find My iPad, go to Settings > [your name] > Find My > Find My iPad, and turn it on. This feature works even if your iPad is offline, as long as it has an active Wi-Fi or cellular connection.

3. Keep Your iPad Up to Date

Apple regularly releases new updates for its operating system, iOS, which include security patches and bug fixes. Make sure to update your iPad to the latest version of iOS as soon as it is available. You can check for updates by going to Settings > General > Software Update.

4. Use a VPN

When you use public Wi-Fi, you risk exposing your online activity to snoopers and hackers. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic and hides your IP address, making it impossible for anyone to spy on you. There are many VPN apps available for iPad, and some of them are free.

5. Be Careful with App Permissions

When you install a new app on your iPad, it may ask for access to your contacts, photos, microphone, camera, or other sensitive information. It's important to read the permissions carefully and only grant access when it's necessary. Some apps may misuse your data or sell it to third-party advertisers.

6. Use Two-Factor Authentication

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your Apple ID, which is the account you use to sign in to iCloud, App Store, and other Apple services. With 2FA enabled, you will receive a verification code on your trusted device (e.g. iPhone) whenever you sign in from a new device or browser. This ensures that only you can access your Apple account, even if someone else knows your password.

CONCLUSION:

In conclusion, keeping your iPad safe from prying eyes requires a combination of basic precautions and advanced techniques. By following the tips mentioned above, you can protect your iPad and your personal information from being exposed to unauthorized access. Remember, prevention is better than cure, so be proactive and stay vigilant.

This article explains how to lock your iPad with a numeric passcode or an alphanumeric password.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Open Settings. Select Touch ID & Passcode, Face ID & Passcode, or Passcode, depending on your iPad model and version.Tap Turn Passcode On and enter a passcode or tap Passcode Options for other authentication methods such as alphanumeric codes.Consider toggling off Siri and disabling Today View and Notification Center access so these tools can't be used via the lock screen.

 
##   How to Password Protect Your iPad  
 

Unless an iPad supports TouchID or Face ID, it can only be used after the password or passcode is entered. You can always use those methods, of course, to lock your iPad's screen.

 

Otherwise, follow these steps to password protect your iPad:

 
- Open the Settings app from the iPad Home screen.
 - Many iPads don't have a fingerprint scanner or support facial identification. For these iPads, choose Passcode in the left panel.
 - If the iPad has a fingerprint scanner, select TouchID & Passcode.
 - On iPads equipped with facial identification, choose Face ID & Passcode instead.
 - Only one of these options will be available in the iPad's settings.
 - Tap Turn Passcode On in the right panel.
 - If you enrolled fingerprints on your iPad, you may be asked if you want to delete or keep them, depending on your iOS version.
 - Use the on-screen keypad to enter a passcode in the Set Passcode window.
 - If you prefer, tap Passcode Options and choose a different authentication method: Custom Alphanumeric Code, Custom Numeric Code, or 4-Digit Numeric Code.
 - The iPad can become disabled if you make too many mistakes when logging in with the passcode. Secure your iPad with a phrase or number series that's easy for you to remember but difficult for someone else to guess.
 - Enter the passcode again when prompted.
 - Type your Apple ID password when prompted to do so for verification.
 - Did you forget your Apple ID password? It's easy to reset.
 - Wait while the passcode is set and for the text box or keypad to disappear.
 - Exit the Settings app.

 
##   Before Leaving the Passcode Lock Settings  
 

The iPad now asks for the passcode before letting you into the home screen. However, a few things are still accessible from the lock screen.

 

Open the Settings app from the iPad Home screen.

 

Many iPads don't have a fingerprint scanner or support facial identification. For these iPads, choose Passcode in the left panel.

 

If the iPad has a fingerprint scanner, select TouchID & Passcode.

 

On iPads equipped with facial identification, choose Face ID & Passcode instead.

 

Only one of these options will be available in the iPad's settings.

 

Tap Turn Passcode On in the right panel.

 
If you enrolled fingerprints on your iPad, you may be asked if you want to delete or keep them, depending on your iOS version.
 

Use the on-screen keypad to enter a passcode in the Set Passcode window.

 

If you prefer, tap Passcode Options and choose a different authentication method: Custom Alphanumeric Code, Custom Numeric Code, or 4-Digit Numeric Code.

 
The iPad can become disabled if you make too many mistakes when logging in with the passcode. Secure your iPad with a phrase or number series that's easy for you to remember but difficult for someone else to guess.
 

Enter the passcode again when prompted.

 

Type your Apple ID password when prompted to do so for verification.

 
Did you forget your Apple ID password? It's easy to reset.
 

Wait while the passcode is set and for the text box or keypad to disappear.

 

Exit the Settings app.

 

Siri is accessible from the lock screen. If you use it as a personal assistant, setting meetings and reminders without unlocking your iPad can be a time saver. On the flip side, Siri allows anyone to set these meetings and reminders. If you want to keep your private information private, toggle Siri off so that it can't be used from the lock screen.

 

Consider disabling access to Today View and Notification Center from the lock screen. These items access meeting reminders, your daily schedule, and iPad widgets you have installed. Disable it from the lock screen to make your iPad super secure.

 

You may want to disable Home Control from the lock screen, also. If you have smart devices in your house (such as a smart thermostat, garage door, lights, or a front door lock), restrict access to these features from the lock screen. Consider turning this off if you have any smart devices that allow entry into your home.

 
With Face ID enabled, you're free to set a requirement that notifications don't display unless the iPad recognizes your face.
 

Enable the Erase Data option so that your iPad will be wiped if the passcode is entered incorrectly 10 times in a row. While it's a neat feature to remotely wipe an iPad automatically should it be stolen, it might not always be helpful. If you have kids around, be aware that should they tap your iPad a few dozen times without knowing what they're doing, it could wipe all the data from your tablet.

 
##   Should You Secure Your iPad With a Passcode?  
 

Passcodes aren't mandatory, but they're a good security practice.

 

One reason to lock an iPad with a passcode is to stop a stranger from snooping around if you lose the iPad or it gets stolen, but there are other reasons to lock up your iPad. For example, if you have young children in your household, you might consider a password so that they can't open apps like Netflix and find videos that you don't want them to watch.
