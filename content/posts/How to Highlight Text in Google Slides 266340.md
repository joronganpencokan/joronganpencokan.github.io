# Discover the Secret Trick to Elevating Your Google Slides Presentations with Highlighted Text!

As a presenter, you want to make sure that your audience is fully engaged and entertained from start to finish. And one of the ways of achieving this is by making your presentations visually appealing and stand out. One of the easiest ways to make your Google Slides presentation more eye-catching is by highlighting important text.

In this article, we will dive deep into how to use highlighting in Google Slides and transform your presentations from dull to exciting.

## Purpose of Highlighting

Highlighting text serves two main purposes:

1. Draw attention: Highlighting important text makes it stand out and draws attention to them. It helps to emphasize important points and ensures that the audience takes note of them.

2. Organization: By highlighting, you can group similar text together, making it easy for your audience to follow along.

## How to Highlight Text in Google Slides

Highlighting text in Google Slides is a straightforward process. Follow these simple steps:

1. Select the text you want to highlight. You can do this by clicking and dragging the mouse over the text.

2. Go to the 'Text Color' dropdown in the toolbar.

3. Move the cursor to 'Highlight.'

4. Click on the desired highlight color.

5. The selected text will now be highlighted.

Notably, you can choose the color that you want to use as a highlight. This is important when you want to differentiate between different categories such as facts, figures, and conclusions.

## Highlighting Techniques

Highlighting text can be done using various techniques, including:

### Highlighting as You Present

This technique is useful when you want to emphasize points as they come up in your presentation. You can choose a color beforehand, then highlight important points in real-time as you present.

To do this, during the presentation, move your cursor to the 'Text Color' dropdown and select the highlight color for your text. The selected text will be highlighted immediately.

### Highlighting to Group Similar Points

This technique helps to organize related information into groups. You can highlight all the critical pieces of information with the same color, so your audience can quickly identify which points are related.

To do this, you highlight each related point using the same highlight color, then proceed to the next group of information, where you use a different color to differentiate it from the previous.

### Use Colored Boxes Instead of Highlighting

In some cases, highlighting text can be overwhelming, and the presentation can end up looking cluttered. In such cases, it may be better to use colored boxes to highlight the text.

To do this, you first insert a text box, then using the 'Fill color' option, change the color of the text box to the desired highlight color. Next, place the text you want to highlight inside the box.

## Conclusion

Highlighting text is an effortless way of making your Google Slides presentation more visually appealing and attention-grabbing. It helps to emphasize important points, organize related information, and create a more organized and structured presentation.

With the above-highlighting techniques, you can easily elevate and make your presentation more exciting for your audience. Be creative, experiment with different colors, and create presentations that illustrate more meaningfully to your audience.
