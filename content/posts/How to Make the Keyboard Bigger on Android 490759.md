## How to Make Gboard Bigger on Android
 
There are three ways to enlarge Gboard on Android, depending on the situation you’re facing.
 
### Method 1: By Resizing Keyboard
 
- Open Messages or any other app to get the Gboard keyboard to show up.
 - Tap on the “Settings” icon in the toolbar. If you don’t see the icon, tap on the three-dot icon at the top-left corner of Gboard and select “Settings.”

 
- Go to “Preferences -> Keyboard height.”

 
- Select anything above “Normal” i.e., “Mid-tall,” “Tall,” or “Extra-tall” to make your keyboard taller.

 
- Tap on “Normal” to revert the keyboard height back to the original size.

 
### Method 2: Turn off One-Hand Mode
 
If Gboard seems to be small and present only on one side of the phone, then you might have accidentally enabled the one-handed mode.
 
- To turn the one-handed mode off for Gboard, tap on the four-arrow icon on the keyboard. Doing so will make Gboard bigger.

 
- You can also go to Gboard’s “Settings -> Preferences -> One-handed mode” and select “Off” to disable one-handed mode.

 
### Method 3: Turn off the Floating Keyboard
 
If Gboard seems to be displaced from its original position and appears in the middle or at the top of the screen, then you have turned on the floating mode of Gboard. Don’t worry, you can easily disable it to make your keyboard bigger as shown below:
 
- Open the Gboard keyboard in any app.
 - Look for the keyboard icon with a bar over it in the Gboard’s top bar. If you don’t see it, tap on the three-dot icon and you will find the icon. Tap on this icon and you will get your Gboard back to the normal size.

 
Tip: Learn additional tips that will enable you to use Gboard like a pro.
