# Unlock the Power of Elden Ring: Discover the Secret Location of the Rare Jellyfish Summon Now!

Elden Ring has been one of the most sought-after games in the industry, and for good reason. Its unique blend of action and RPG elements, coupled with the expertise of FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin, promises to deliver an unparalleled gaming experience.

One of the most exciting aspects of the game is the ability to summon creatures to aid you in battle. These summons come in various shapes and sizes, each with its own unique abilities and strengths. Among these summons, the rare jellyfish is one of the hardest to obtain and the most powerful.

However, the location of the rare jellyfish summon is shrouded in mystery, and only a few have been able to unlock its power. In this article, we'll take a look at how you can discover the secret location of the rare jellyfish summon and unlock its power for yourself.

### Step 1: Find the Hidden Cave

The first step in unlocking the rare jellyfish summon is to find the hidden cave where it resides. The cave is located in a remote area of the game, far from any major cities or landmarks. To find it, you will need to explore the game's world meticulously, keeping an eye out for any clues or hints that may point you in the right direction.

Once you find the cave, you will need to navigate through a series of traps and puzzles to reach the jellyfish summon. This can be a difficult task, as the traps are designed to test your skills and reflexes. Be prepared to spend several hours exploring and experimenting until you find the jellyfish summon.

### Step 2: Defeat the Jellyfish Boss

Once you reach the jellyfish summon, you will need to defeat the jellyfish boss to unlock its power. This is no easy task, as the jellyfish boss is one of the most challenging enemies in the game. Its attacks are fast and unpredictable, and it can deal massive damage if you're not careful.

To defeat the jellyfish boss, you will need to use all of your skills and abilities. Make sure to dodge its attacks and counter with your own. You may need to grind for better equipment or level up your character before attempting this fight, so don't be afraid to take your time.

### Step 3: Unlock the Power of the Rare Jellyfish Summon

After defeating the jellyfish boss, you will unlock the power of the rare jellyfish summon. This summon has a unique ability to stun enemies and deal massive damage, making it a valuable ally in battles.

To use the rare jellyfish summon, you will need to equip it in your summoning slot and activate it during battles. Its power can quickly turn the tide of a difficult fight and provide a much-needed advantage.

### Conclusion

Unlocking the power of the rare jellyfish summon in Elden Ring is a challenging task, but the rewards are well worth the effort. Not only does the summon provide a powerful ally in battles, but it also adds to the thrill of discovering and exploring the game's world.

Jellyfish is one of the first and the cutest Spirit companion you get in the game. But many new players don’t have this Spirit companion, even though they have seen this on YouTube or Twitch. But it’s really easy to get if you know where to look for it. So today we will look at, how & where to get Elden Ring Jellyfish Summon.
 
## Where to Get Jellyfish Summon Elden Ring (Location)
 
For the easiest way to get Elden Ring Jellyfish Summon, you need to talk to Roderika in the Stormhill Shack location. Once you complete all dialogue options (talk to her 3 times), she will give you this Spirit companion. But if you missed this, and she moves to Roundtable Hold, then talk to her there to get this Spirit Summon. You need to select the “Please” option, once she becomes a Spirit Tuner.
 
## How to Summon Jellyfish
 
To summon Jellyfish in Elden Ring, you need to get a Spirit Calling Bell. The ‘Twin Maiden Husks’ at the Roundtable Hold sells this item. But if you don’t want to spend Runes, then you can go to Church of Elleh in Limgrave at night, after getting Torrent from Melina. You will find blue NPC Renna there, and she will give you a Spirit Calling Bell.
 
Spirit Calling Bell can only be used to summon Jellyfish in particular areas with “rebirth monuments” in the world. But almost every boss fight and area will have these monuments, and will allow you to summon the spirit. Rebirth Monuments can also be found near all major locations in the map. You will know this when you see an icon appearing on the left side of your screen. Now use your Spirit Calling Bell to get Jellyfish in the fight.
 
That’s all about how to get this spirit companion in Elden Ring. While you are here, make sure to check out more of our Elden Ring Guides like How To Reduce & Cure Madness Effect.
