Are you tired of staring at that pesky hole punch on your Samsung Galaxy S10 while watching your favorite movie or scrolling through social media? We've got a trick for you that will make that intrusive hole punch disappear and make your phone look like it doesn't even have a front camera!

First things first, head to the Google Play Store and download the Nacho Notch app. This app will allow you to black out the area surrounding the hole punch, making it blend seamlessly into the rest of your screen.

Once you have the app downloaded, go to the Settings and select Display. From there, enable Full-Screen Apps and then select Nacho Notch as your default choice. This will automatically black out the space surrounding the hole punch every time you open an app.

But what if you want to use your phone's camera? No problem! Simply swipe down from the top of your screen to access the quick settings menu and toggle off the Nacho Notch app. This will reveal the hole punch and allow you to take selfies or video chat with ease.

If you want to take it a step further and completely remove the hole punch from your screen, you can also try out different wallpapers that creatively conceal the punch. There are plenty of options available that will make your phone look like it is free of any blemishes or distractions.

So, there you have it - the secret trick to hiding your Samsung Galaxy S10 hole punch like a pro! With the Nacho Notch app and creative wallpaper choices, your phone will look sleek and professional, without sacrificing any of its amazing camera features.

Instead of going for the “notch” on their newest addition to Galaxy family of devices, Samsung went with the new “hole-punch” design. This allows Samsung Galaxy S10E, Galaxy S10, and Galaxy S10 Plus to have thinner bezels on the top of the screen. The Galaxy S10 and S10 E have a circle hole punch, while the Galaxy S10 Plus has a longer cut out for its dual lens front facing camera. This design may let users have more screen but some may find it a bit ugly to look at, especially on the Galaxy S10 Plus. But there are ways you can hide the cutout. Here’s how to hide hole punch on Samsung Galaxy S10, S10 E, and S10 Plus.
