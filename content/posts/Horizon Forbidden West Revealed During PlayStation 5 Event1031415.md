## The Gameplay

Horizon Forbidden West will introduce new gameplay mechanics like swimming and diving underwater, and Aloy's updated focus, which now adds the ability to reveal critical information about enemies, people, and environmental effects. The game introduces a new tribe of enemies, the raiders, to go with the robot dinosaurs that make their return from the previous game, and players will have to account for environmental hazards like sandstorms, floods, and more along the way. 

## The Graphics and Sound

The graphics and sounds of Horizon Forbidden West are undoubtedly mind-blowing. With every move, Aloy makes, we hear the crunch of leaves beneath her feet, the roar of robotic raptors, and the rush of water. The game is rendered in 4K resolution, and the quality is just astonishing. The water is so crystal clear you could swear it was real. 

## The Conclusion

In conclusion, the revelations made during the PlayStation 5 event have us all hyped up for the release of Horizon Forbidden West. The extensive new playground to explore, the updated focus, the new enemies and features, the captivating story, the graphics, and more are all exciting reasons to play the game.
