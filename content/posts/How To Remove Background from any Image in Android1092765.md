If you’re someone who loves editing pictures or creating collages, you may have experienced the need to remove the background of an image at some point. This is particularly useful when you wish to superimpose the subject of a photo onto a new background or combine two images seamlessly, among other things.

Traditionally, removing the background of an image has been a time-consuming and tedious process. Photoshop, one of the most popular editing software, can be immensely powerful when it comes to image manipulation, but would require a certain level of skill, time and money which is not feasible for the average user. Enter the Android app world, where there are many free or low-cost apps available that let you perform this seemingly complicated task in a few simple taps!

Upload Your Image

Erase the Background

The app provides a tool that detects the outline of the subject in the image, and you can use this tool to manually refine the outline by erasing parts of the background. You can also switch to the auto mode, where the app removes the background automatically based on the color detection algorithm.

Save Your Image

Once you’re satisfied with your work, save your image in any format of your choice. The app supports major image file types such as PNG, JPG, and GIF, among others.

Conclusion

The Background Eraser app is a handy tool for anyone who wants to effortlessly remove the background from their photos.
