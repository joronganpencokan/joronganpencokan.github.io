2. Type "cmd" in the Run dialog box and press Enter.

3. The Command Prompt window will open.

## Step 3: Reset Your Password

1. Type "net user" in the Command Prompt window and press Enter.

2. You will see a list of all the user accounts on your computer.

3. Type "net user [account name] * " (without quotes) and press Enter. Replace [account name] with the name of the account you want to reset the password for.

4. You will be prompted to enter a new password for the account. Type a new password and press Enter.

5. You will be prompted to confirm the password. Retype the password and press Enter.

## Step 4: Restart Your Computer

Once you have reset your password, you need to restart your computer to exit Safe Mode. Press the Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box and type "shutdown /r" (without quotes) and press Enter.

## Conclusion

Forgetting your Windows 10/11 login password can be incredibly frustrating, but it's not the end of the world. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily reset your password and regain access to your computer.
