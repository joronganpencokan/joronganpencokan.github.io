# Stop Android Apps from Secretly Stealing Your Data with this Simple Trick!

As a smartphone user, you may trust the apps that you download and use daily, but there always remains a risk that some of these apps have malicious intent. Some of them may remove personal data from your device without your knowledge, while others may access features they don’t need to perform their functions. Today, we will explore a simple trick that you can use to protect yourself against these apps.

## Identify Data-Hungry Apps

Some Android apps have unrestricted access to different features of your mobile phone, like contact list, camera, and GPS location. Apps with malicious intent can use this access to exploit your personal information, jeopardizing your privacy. Before finding a solution to prevent data-stealing apps, you should identify apps that collect your data or perform rogue activities. Check which apps have a high amount of data access and the need to access certain features you do not use in your daily life.

## Use App Permissions

App permissions are a powerful tool that Android devices offer to stop apps from performing unauthorized tasks. You should only grant app permissions to access the data it needs to function correctly, and nothing more. For example, if a flashlight app requests access to your microphone, you can deny that request.

To access the app permissions, go to Settings > Apps & Notifications > App Permissions.

## Install a Firewall

A firewall acts as an invisible barrier between your device and the internet, controlling the traffic and identifying malicious activities. There are different options for firewalls, both free and paid, in the Play Store.

NetGuard Firewall is a free firewall that allows you to block internet access for apps on your mobile device based on their permission settings. With this app, you can block access to the internet for apps that do not need it or for suspicious apps.

## Limit Background Data Usage

Many apps continue to consume data in the background, even when you are not actively using them. This continuous data collection can impact overall performance and, more importantly, put your device at risk. Therefore, it is critical to limit the background data usage of apps. 

To limit background data usage, go to Settings > Network & Internet > Data Usage > App Data Usage, select the app for which you want to limit background data usage, then turn on the ‘Restrict Background Data’ option.

## Keep You Phone Up-to-Date

Another essential aspect of protecting your device is keeping it up-to-date. Android devices receive regular security updates that fix known vulnerabilities, and by staying up-to-date, you can ensure that you are protected from security threats. Therefore, we recommend that you update your device to the latest version of Android, whenever possible.

In conclusion, your mobile device is a treasure trove of personal information, and we need to ensure that it stays protected from data thieves. By following the tips outlined above, you can secure your device and prevent malicious apps. Remember to do regular checks and follow security updates, which can help keep your mobile device secure from hackers.
