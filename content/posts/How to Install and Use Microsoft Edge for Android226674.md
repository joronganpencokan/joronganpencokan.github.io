Tap the ellipses ( ... ) in the lower-right corner of Edge and select Settings > Content blockers to toggle Adblock Plus on and off.

 
###   Reading View  
 

This feature removes ads and other elements that get in your way when reading online. If a web page supports Reading View, you see an open book icon next to the URL bar. Select it to switch views. The header image remains visible. Other graphics, widgets, and stylized fonts are replaced by plain text.

 
###   Reading List  
 

The Reading List feature saves interesting web pages or articles you find to read at a later time. Select the Hub icon next to the URL bar (it looks like a star with three lines shooting out of it), select the Reading List icon (the stack of books), then select the web page to add it to your reading list.

 
###   Continue on PC  
 

By enabling Continue on PC, you can browse the web on Edge for Windows 10 from where you left off in Edge for Android. Before you can take advantage of this feature, install the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update on your PC. You'll also need to use Edge for Windows 10 to link your phone to your Microsoft account using a multi-step process. This process requires you to download an app called Microsoft Launcher for Android.
