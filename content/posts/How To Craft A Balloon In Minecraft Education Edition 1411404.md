## How to Make a Balloon in Minecraft Education Edition
 

 
Balloons in the real world are made by making a flexible bag out of rubber or Latex and are filled with Helium, Air, or any other material depending on the use of the Balloon. The recipe for a Balloon in Minecraft Education Edition isn’t that far off. To make a Balloon you will need 6 Latex items, a Block of Helium, a choice of Dye, and a Lead. The Helium Block must have 2 protons, 2 electrons, and a neutron when making it in the Element Constructor.
 
Once you have all of the Items, go to a Crafting Table. In the Table, fill the Left and Right Columns with Latex. You should only have the middle column empty. Now take the Helium Block and put it in the center. This will make an H-shape with the Latex and Helium Block. Above the Helium Block put a Dye of your color choice. This will give the color of the Balloon. Finally, at the bottom of the Helium Block put a Lead. This will give you the ability to tie the Balloon to other Entities or Blocks.
 
### How to use a Balloon
 
With the above steps, you will be able to make a Balloon in  Minecraft Education Edition. You can make different colored Balloons by changing the color of Dye while crafting the Balloon.
