##   Preparations for Installing Windows Service Pack 2  
 

Before you install Windows Vista Service Pack 2, take the time to back up your data and perform pre-installation checks and final checks as listed here.

 
###   Back Up, Back Up, and Then Back Up Some More  
 

As with any upgrade to Windows, no matter the version, the most important first step to take is backing up your personal files.

 

Any software installation or update has the potential to malfunction. There is nothing worse than dealing with a bad update that destroys your files because of a corrupted file, power outage, or mechanical failure. If your PC goes on the fritz during an update, don't let it take your photos, videos, and documents with it.

 

There are several ways you can back up your files and plenty of free backup software utilities are available to make saving your data a breeze.

 
###   Perform Pre-Installation Checks  
 

Now that your files are backed up, you're ready for the next step. Before you install the Vista SP2 upgrade, perform the following checks.

 

As it is a prerequisite for installing its successor, make sure you have Windows Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1) installed before you try to install Vista SP2. If you're not sure if you have SP1, keep using Windows Update to search for new updates by doing the following:

 
- Go to Start > Control Panel.
 - In the Control Panel search box, enter Windows Update.
 - Select Check for updates.
 - Install any required updates.

 

The great thing about Windows Update is that it won't let you install updates without installing their prerequisites first.

 

Go to Start > Control Panel.

 

In the Control Panel search box, enter Windows Update.

 

Select Check for updates.

 

Install any required updates.

 
###   Final Checks  
 

The rest of the pre-upgrade checks are straightforward. Here's what you need to do:

 
- Ensure there is a constant power supply so the computer does not shut off during the upgrade process.
 - Check that there is enough hard drive space. Vista SP2 can use up to 2 GB of space.
 - Do one last check to make sure you backed up all critical files before the upgrade.
 - Temporarily disable your antivirus software, and close all programs before beginning the upgrade.
