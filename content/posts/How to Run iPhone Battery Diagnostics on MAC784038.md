# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Test Your iPhone Battery Health On A Mac - Learn Now!

Are you experiencing issues with your iPhone battery? Does it drain too quickly? Do you find that you have to charge it multiple times a day? While there are a plethora of reasons why your iPhone's battery might not be performing at its best, one common culprit is aging.

As your iPhone gets older, the battery's health deteriorates, resulting in a shorter battery lifespan. Thankfully, there's an easy way to check your iPhone's battery health using your Mac. In this article, we will guide you through the steps to test your iPhone battery health on a Mac.

## Step 1: Make Sure Your Mac Meets The Requirements

Before you proceed with testing your iPhone's battery health, make sure your Mac meets these requirements:

- It should have macOS Catalina or later installed.
- It should have the latest version of iTunes installed.

## Step 2: Connect Your iPhone To Your Mac

Connect your iPhone to your Mac using a lightning cable. Once your iPhone is connected, iTunes should launch automatically. If it doesn't, you can launch iTunes manually.

## Step 3: Navigate To Your iPhone's Summary Page

Once iTunes is open, you'll see your iPhone's icon on the top left corner. Click on it to open your iPhone's summary page.

## Step 4: Check Your iPhone's Battery Health

On your iPhone's summary page, you'll see a section called **Battery**. Click on it to view your iPhone's battery health. You'll be able to see two important pieces of information - Maximum Capacity and Peak Performance Capability.

- Maximum Capacity: This is the measure of your iPhone battery's current capacity compared to when it was new. A lower percentage indicates that your iPhone's battery has worn out and might need replacement.
- Peak Performance Capability: This measures how well your iPhone's battery is performing concerning the phone's processor demands. If this is lower than 100%, it means that your iPhone's battery is aging and might need replacement.

## Step 5: Interpret The Results

If your iPhone's battery maximum capacity is under 80%, it means that it's time to get your battery replaced. Typically, iPhone batteries are designed to retain up to 80% of their original capacity for about 500 charge cycles.

If your iPhone's peak performance capability isn't at 100%, it doesn't necessarily mean you need to replace your battery, but it does indicate that your iPhone is experiencing some level of battery aging.

## Conclusion

Testing your iPhone battery health on your Mac is a straightforward process that can tell you a lot about the performance and expected lifespan of your iPhone battery. If you find that your battery isn't lasting as long as it should, testing your iPhone battery health should be the first step in diagnosing the problem. And if you discover that you need a new battery, the good news is that Apple makes it easy to get one by visiting an Apple Store, an authorized service provider, or contacting Apple Support.

### Deciphering Data


Charge Capacity: Power is displayed as milliamp hours or mAh. In cases of 6s, it can store 1715mAh of power, but use has declined to a maximum charge of 1311mAh or 76.4%. This decline happens from a device of its age, like 477 days old, but if your device’s maximum is less than the design capacity, you prefer to exchange your battery.
Load cycles and Usage: One load cycle is one full discharge followed b one full charge, i.e., from 0% to 100%. So if you have a 50% charge, use up to 50%, i.e., one load cycle. On average, you can go up to 1000 load cycles before the battery’s capacity falls behind the design capacity.
