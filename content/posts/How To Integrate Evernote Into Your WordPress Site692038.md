Introduction:

Evernote is a powerful tool that can be used to help you manage your life and work more efficiently. It's an application that allows you to create, organize, and share notes, photos, and more. And if you're already using WordPress, you can easily incorporate Evernote into your site using a few simple steps.

In this article, we'll explore how you can use Evernote to streamline your workflow and increase your productivity by seamlessly integrating it into your WordPress site.

Step 1: Install Evernote in WordPress

The first step in incorporating Evernote into your WordPress site is to install the Evernote plugin. To do this, log into your WordPress dashboard and navigate to the Plugins page. Then click on the "Add New" button and search for "Evernote" in the search bar.

Once you find the Evernote plugin, click on "Install Now" and activate the plugin. This will allow you to easily connect your Evernote account to your WordPress site.

Step 2: Connect Your Evernote Account

After you've installed the Evernote plugin, you'll need to connect your account. To do this, go to the Evernote tab in your WordPress dashboard and click on the "Connect to Evernote" button.

You'll be prompted to log into your Evernote account and authorize the connection. Once you've done this, your Evernote account will be linked to your WordPress site, and you'll be able to access your notes and notebooks from within WordPress.

Step 3: Embed Notes and Notebooks in WordPress

Now that you've connected your Evernote account to your WordPress site, you can start embedding your notes and notebooks into your posts and pages.

To do this, go to the Evernote tab in your WordPress dashboard and click on "Embed Notes." You'll then be asked to select the note or notebook you want to embed.

After you've made your selection, you can choose how you want the note or notebook to be displayed in WordPress. You can choose to display it as a list, a grid, or a slideshow.

Step 4: Use Evernote as a Research Tool

One of the great benefits of using Evernote in WordPress is that it can also serve as a powerful research tool. You can use Evernote to clip and save articles, images, and other research material, and then embed them directly into your posts and pages.

To clip an article or image, simply install the Evernote Web Clipper to your browser. This will allow you to quickly and easily save content to your Evernote account as you browse the web.

Conclusion:

Incorporating Evernote into your WordPress site can be a game-changer when it comes to streamlining your workflow and improving your productivity. With the Evernote plugin, you can easily connect your Evernote account to your WordPress site, embed your notes and notebooks, and use it as a research tool.

So why not give it a try and see how much easier managing your website and content can be with Evernote at your side?

Organizational types really like Evernote. With all of the add-ons and the option to store information to your notebooks from just about everywhere, it might not be a bad idea to consider integrating Evernote into your WordPress site. Here we’re gonna talk about two different types of Evernote plugins for WordPress. One of the plugins let you easily share information as a blog post, and the other is essentially a bookmarking tool or clipping feature for your readers.

 
## Evernote Site Memory Button
 
WP Evernote Site Memory is a really easy way to add a button for your readers to clip the page contents to their Evernote account. WP Evernote Site Memory currently has 15 different button choices. The buttons range in size and some have languages other than English too. An additional benefit to site WordPress site owners is in the plugin customizing. You can choose how the title of their clipped note will read and also add in a signature or general notes in the header and footer of the clipped page. These can remind the reader of what your site has to offer, thank them for clipping the post or even offer up a coupon code for a product you may sell.
 

 
Because of the customizing options, this could be a very useful add-on for anyone running a site geared toward business or organization.

## Everpress
 
Everpress is more for the person running the site. When you run a site, you may want to make a post about cool articles you’ve seen over the last week or month. Everpress lets you save URLs into a shared folder in your Evernote account. When you save a URL to this folder, the next time Everpress looks at the RSS feed for this folder, it will create a new article with the added URLs automatically.
 
Everpress has some cool customizing features in the settings. You can select the time of day, author, tags, category and how often you’d like to post a new article. If you have more than one folder to share from, Everpress can share from multiple folders. In testing, it looks like the plugin will publish the newest link in the RSS feed, not the whole list.

Other WordPress plug-ins have the choice of adding Evernote as an option for sharing. With the popularity of Evernote, I am really surprised more people don’t offer an option to clip to Evernote. Sure there are add-ons for browsers to clip, when they use an option not installed on your site, can you track it? Nope. Make it as easy as you can for people to save and reuse the information you are putting out there. If saving and retrieving your information is easy for them, they will use the information a lot. Isn’t why you are putting out those free articles everyday on your site, to help people?
