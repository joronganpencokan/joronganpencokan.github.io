The Moto G 2015 is an excellent device with a well-designed interface and a host of impressive features. However, the device's full potential can be limited by the manufacturer's restrictions, preventing users from accessing advanced functionality and customizations. Fortunately, there is a way to overcome these limitations and unleash the full potential of your Moto G 2015 - rooting. In this article, we will explore how you can root your device and take advantage of its full potential.

## What is Rooting?

In simple terms, rooting is the process of unlocking the operating system of your device, allowing you to access features and customizations that were previously out of reach. Rooting grants you administrator-level access to system files, enabling you to tweak and modify your device as per your preferences.

## Why Root Your Moto G 2015?

Rooting your Moto G 2015 has many benefits, including:

- Access to advanced features such as custom ROMs and third-party apps.
- The ability to modify and optimize system files for better performance.
- A broader range of customization options to personalize your device's appearance and function.
- Removing restrictions on app permissions, enabling apps to access features that were previously off-limits.

## Before You Root Your Moto G 2015

While rooting your Moto G 2015 comes with many advantages, it's important to understand that it also carries potential risks. Rooting can void your device warranty, and if not done correctly, can damage your device beyond repair. Therefore, it's essential to follow the steps carefully and back up your data before proceeding.

## How to Root Your Moto G 2015?

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to root your Moto G 2015:

### Step 1: Unlock the Bootloader

Before rooting, you must unlock the bootloader of your device. To do this:

1. Go to "Settings > About Phone > Build Number" and tap on "Build Number" seven times to enable Developer Options.
2. Go to "Settings > Developer Options" and enable "USB debugging" and "OEM unlocking."
3. Power off your device and turn it on in bootloader mode by pressing and holding down the volume down and power buttons simultaneously.
4. Connect your device to your computer with a USB cable, and open the command prompt (for Windows) or terminal (for Mac and Linux) and type the following command:

```fastboot oem unlock```

5. A pop-up message will appear on your device asking you to confirm bootloader unlocking. Use the volume buttons to navigate and the power button to select "Yes."

### Step 2: Download the Root Files

Now that you've unlocked your bootloader, it's time to download the necessary root files. We recommend downloading the TWRP recovery image and the SuperSU zip file.

### Step 3: Install TWRP Recovery

Next, you need to install the TWRP recovery image on your device. To do this:

1. Download the TWRP recovery image and save it to your computer.
2. Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the folder where you saved the TWRP recovery image.
3. Connect your device to your computer and enter the following command:

```fastboot boot twrp-3.4.0-0-osprey.img```

4. Your device will boot into the TWRP recovery mode.

### Step 4: Flash SuperSU

Now that you're in the TWRP recovery mode, you can flash SuperSU and root your device. To do this:

1. Download the SuperSU zip file and save it to your device's internal storage or SD card.
2. In TWRP recovery mode, tap on "Install" and navigate to the location where you saved the SuperSU file.
3. Select the SuperSU zip file and swipe to confirm the installation.
4. After the installation is complete, tap on "Reboot System."

Congratulations! You have successfully rooted your Moto G 2015.

Before you can proceed to gain root access on your Moto G, you will need to unlock its bootloader using Motorola’s web based unlock tool. If you are running Windows, you will need to install these drivers on your PC before you can use ADB and fastboot on your PC.

Keep in mind though that unlocking the bootloader will wipe your device of all data so make a backup before you proceed with the steps. Additionally, do note that requesting Motorola for the bootloader unlock key itself will void the warranty of your device irrespective of whether you then root the handset or not.
Step 1: Download the required ADB/Fastboot files from below, if you did not already do it while unlocking the bootloader. Also, download the TWRP recovery and SuperSU ZIP file for your handset from below.

 

ADB/Fastboot – Mac | Windows (Download and install)
TWRP for Moto G (2015)
SuperSU (Transfer this ZIP file to the internal storage of your Moto G)



Make sure to rename the TWRP file to something simple like “motog.img”.  Also, keep the ADB/Fastboot and TWRP image file inside a new folder called “moto” on your desktop. Open up a new command prompt or terminal window and navigate to this folder using the ‘cd’ command. Windows users can also Shift + right click on the folder and select the open command window here option.
Step 2: Reboot your device into fastboot mode by switching it off first and then pressing Volume down + Power button at the same time. Leave the keys after a few seconds and your Moto G will automatically boot into bootloader mode. Connect it to your PC and enter the following commands in the Command prompt or terminal window which you had opened in the previous step:
The above command will confirm whether your device is being detected by your PC or not. Mac users, make sure to prefer a “./” before every fastboot command.
Now, you need to flash the TWRP recovery on the device using the following command -:
Step 3: Use the Volume Down button to select the Reboot option and confirm your selection by pressing the Volume Up button. Once your device has booted back into Android, again switch it off and boot it back into bootloader mode (as mentioned in Step 2).

Step 4: From the bootloader menu, select the ‘Recovery’ option and confirm it by pressing the Volume Up button. Once your Moto G boots into recovery, tap on ‘Install’ and then select the SuperSU zip file that you had transferred to the device in Step 1.
Once the ZIP file has been flashed, select the ‘Reboot system’ option. The first boot after installing SuperSU might take sometime as the cache for all the installed apps needs to be rebuild.
To confirm whether you have root access on your device or not, you can use applications like Root Checker from the Play Store. If you are facing any issues, make sure to drop in a comment and we will be happy to help you out.
