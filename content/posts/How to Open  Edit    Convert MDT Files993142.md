# Transform Your MDT Experience and Revolutionize Your Workflow: Discover the Ultimate Guide to Opening, Editing and Converting MDT Files Now!

If you work with MDT files, you know how tedious and frustrating it can be to open, edit, and convert them. MDT files, or Microsoft Deployment Tool files, are used to create images of Windows operating systems for deployment across multiple machines. While MDT is an incredibly useful tool for system administrators, navigating MDT files can be a challenge. In this guide, we’ll show you how to transform your MDT experience and revolutionize your workflow with some simple tips and tricks.

## What is MDT?

Microsoft Deployment Tool, or MDT, is a tool that helps system administrators deploy and manage Windows operating systems. MDT works by creating a single image of Windows, which can then be deployed to multiple machines with ease. MDT can be used to automate the installation process, install drivers and applications, and configure settings. MDT files are used to store this single image, and they can be created and edited with the MDT tool.

## Opening MDT Files

Opening MDT files is a simple process, but it can be confusing for those who are not familiar with the tool. To open an MDT file, you will need to have the MDT tool installed on your computer. Once you have the tool installed:

1. Open the MDT tool
2. Click on File
3. Click on Open Deployment Share
4. Browse to the location of the MDT file you want to open
5. Select the file and click Open

The MDT tool should now open the file for you to edit.

## Editing MDT Files

Editing MDT files can be a bit tricky, as there are many different settings and options to choose from. To make it easier, we’ve compiled a list of some common edits:

### Adding Drivers

If you need to add drivers to your MDT file, follow these steps:

1. Open the MDT tool
2. Click on the Deployment Workbench tab
3. Right-click on the deployment share you want to add the drivers to
4. Select Properties
5. Click on the Windows PE tab
6. Click on the Drivers and Patches tab
7. Click on the Import Drivers button
8. Browse to the location of the drivers you want to add
9. Select the drivers and click Open

The drivers will now be added to your MDT file.

### Changing Settings

To change settings in your MDT file, follow these steps:

1. Open the MDT tool
2. Click on the Deployment Workbench tab
3. Click on the Task Sequence tab
4. Right-click on the task sequence you want to edit
5. Select Properties
6. Click on the Task Sequence tab
7. Make your changes and click Apply

Your settings will now be changed in your MDT file.

### Adding Applications

To add applications to your MDT file, follow these steps:

1. Open the MDT tool
2. Click on the Deployment Workbench tab
3. Right-click on the Applications folder
4. Select New Application
5. Follow the prompts to add the application to your MDT file

The application will now be added to your MDT file.

## Converting MDT Files

If you need to convert an MDT file to a different format, such as ISO or WIM, there are a few different tools you can use. The most popular tool is the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK), which includes the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool. DISM is used to convert MDT files to other formats, and it is included in the ADK.

To convert an MDT file using DISM:

1. Install the ADK on your computer
2. Open a command prompt as an administrator
3. Type the following command:

    `dism /Export-Image /SourceImageFile:<path to MDT file> /DestinationImageFile:<path to output file> /Compress:max /CheckIntegrity /Verify`

4. Press Enter

DISM will now convert your MDT file to the specified format.

## Conclusion

MDT files are an essential tool for system administrators, but they can be overwhelming to work with. By following the tips and tricks outlined in this guide, you can transform your MDT experience and revolutionize your workflow. Whether you need to open, edit, or convert MDT files, these simple steps will help you get the most out of this powerful tool.

This article explains what an MDT file is, depending on the format yours is in, and how to open one on your computer or convert one to a different format (if applicable).

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Some MDT files are add-in data files used by MS Access.Others could be database templates used by GeoMedia.How you convert it depends on the format it's in.

 
##   What Is an MDT File?  
 

A file with the .MDT file extension is a data file used by Microsoft Access and its add-ins for storing relevant data.

 

Although Access uses both file types, an MDT file shouldn't be confused with an MDB file, which Access uses to store database information. That is, unless your particular MDT file happens to be an old Microsoft Access 97 template file.

 

An MDT file may instead be a GeoMedia Access database template, which is a format used by the GeoMedia geospatial processing software to create an MDB file out of its data.

 

Some video editing software may use the MDT file extension, too, to store text in the XML format about the video creation process. This may or may not be related to the MDT video format used by some Panasonic cameras.

 
##   How to Open an MDT File  
 

Microsoft Access opens data files that are relevant in that context. Although related to Access databases, if your file is associated with GeoMedia, open it with Hexagon's GeoMedia Smart Client.

 
Autodesk's discontinued Mechanical Desktop software uses this abbreviation as well, but we don't think its files are saved with this extension. These files also have nothing to do with the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit used for installing the Windows operating system.
 

A simple text editor should be able to open MDT files that are produced from video converters or video editors. You probably only need to open this kind if you're not sure where the program is storing the video file, since the location of the video is stored in the MDT file. See our Best Free Text Editors list for some good options.

 

A text editor might be useful even if your file isn't saved in any of these formats. Just open the file there and see if there's any header information or readable text anywhere throughout the file that indicates what program was used to create it. This can help you research software that supports opening that specific file.

 
##   How to Convert an MDT File  
 

An MDT file probably can't be converted into another format that Access recognizes. This type of data file is likely just used by the program when it's needed, and not intended to be opened at will, like with ACCDB and other Access files.

 
If the file is associated with a Panasonic camera, and it's corrupted and not able to be used normally, see this YouTube video on how to repair it with the Grau Video Repair Tool.
 

It's likely that GeoMedia can export its data into other formats in addition to MDT, in which case you can use the same program to open the file and save it to a different format.

 

There's likely no reason to convert an XML-based MDT file, but you certainly can if you want to. Just open it with a text editor and then save it to a compatible format like TXT or HTML.

 
##   Still Can't Open It?  
 

Before assuming that the programs from above aren't working correctly, consider whether you're reading the file extension correctly. It can be easy to confuse one file format with another if they use similar file extensions.

 

For example, MTD looks a lot like MDT but is actually used for Musicnotes digital sheet music files, a format that doesn't work with any of the file openers above.

 

The same could be said for MDF, MDL, and DMT files, all of which are used for unique file formats that open with specific, and different, software programs.
