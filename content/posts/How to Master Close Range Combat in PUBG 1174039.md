# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Dominate Close Range Combat In Pubg! Our Pro Tips Will Have You Winning Every Fight!

Have you been struggling with close-range combat in PUBG? Do you find yourself losing fights in tight spaces or getting outmaneuvered by your opponents? If so, don't worry, because we've got you covered. In this article, we'll share some pro tips that will help you dominate close-range combat in PUBG and come out on top in every fight.

## Know Your Weapons

The first step to dominating close-range combat is knowing what weapons to use. Shotguns and SMGs are the best weapons for close-range fights because of their high damage output and low recoil. Shotguns are especially deadly at very close range and can take out an enemy in one shot. SMGs, on the other hand, are more versatile and can be used for mid-range fights as well.

## Don't Panic

Close-range fights can be intense, and it's easy to panic when you're under pressure. However, panicking will only make things worse. Instead, focus on your breathing and stay calm. Keep your movements controlled and aim for your opponent's head or upper body.

## Use Cover

Cover is your best friend in close-range combat. Use walls, rocks, and trees to your advantage and avoid standing out in the open. Peek around corners and use third-person view to see if your opponent is moving. Also, try to anticipate where your opponent will move and aim accordingly.

## Aim for the Head

Headshots are the most effective way to take down an opponent quickly. Aim for the head, and your opponent will be down before they know what hit them. However, headshots require more accuracy, so make sure to practice your aim in training mode.

## Use Grenades

Grenades can be incredibly effective in close-range combat, especially when your opponent is hiding behind cover. Cook the grenade for a few seconds before throwing it, and it will explode just as it reaches your opponent's location. This will force them to move out of cover, giving you an opportunity to take them down.

## Stay Mobile

One of the biggest mistakes players make in close-range combat is standing still. This makes them an easy target for their opponents. Instead, stay mobile, keep moving, and use strafing and jumping to throw off your opponent's aim.

## Conclusion

Close-range combat in PUBG can be challenging, but with these pro tips, you'll be able to dominate your opponents and come out on top in every fight. Remember, it's all about knowing your weapons, staying calm, using cover, aiming for the head, using grenades, and staying mobile. Practice these tips in training mode, and you'll be a pro in no time. Good luck, and we'll see you on the battlefield!
