In Disney Dreamlight Valley, you get the opportunity to roam the Disneyverse. You will meet many of your favorite Disney and Pixar characters and do fun activities for them like fishing, mining, farming, and much more. Along with that, you have to rebuild the valley, and to do so, you have to increase friendship levels with the residents. Cooking dishes for them is one way to do it. There are 160 recipes in the game which are divided into three categories: Appetizers, Entrées, and Desserts. In this article, we will tell you how to make Lemon Sorbet in Disney Dreamlight Valley.
 
## How to Make Lemon Sorbet in Disney Dreamlight Valley
 

 
Every recipe in this game is star-rated. Lemon Sorbet is a two-star recipe, meaning you need two ingredients to prepare it. The first ingredient is, you guessed it right, lemons. There are two biomes in this game where lemons are available. You can either get them from the Forest of Valor or the Glade of Trust. The Forest of Valor is unlocked for 3,000 Dreamlight while the Glade of Trust can be unlocked for 5,000 Dreamlight.
 
The second ingredient is Slush Ice, which is a bit tricky to get. You can easily get it at Chez Remy’s kitchen for 150 Star Coins but first, you will need to complete some of Chez Remy’s quests. Bring Chez Remy to the valley and help him open his restaurant. Once, you do that, reach level 10 friendship with him and complete his ‘The Unknown Flavor’ quest to permanently unlock Slush Ice. Then you can head over to his kitchen and buy it from his back shelf.
 
After gathering both ingredients, head over to the cooking station. To make Lemon Sorbet, toss the Lemon and Slush Ice in the cooking pot, and voila! Your dish is ready. You can consume it to replenish 1,112 Energy points, sell it for 237 Star Coins, or gift it to increase your friendship level.
