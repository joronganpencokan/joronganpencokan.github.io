Parenting Hack: The Secret Method to Shield Your Kids from Raunchy Online Content!

In this digital age, it's nearly impossible to keep kids off the internet. While the internet serves as an excellent source of education and entertainment, it's also home to raunchy and inappropriate content.

As parents, our role is to ensure that our children are safe on the internet, and this is where parenting hacks come in handy. Today, we'll focus on the secret method to shield your kids from raunchy online content.

Enter Hugo writing format, an innovative writing method that allows you to selectively filter out specific types of content. With this method, you can significantly reduce the chances of your children coming across unwanted content while browsing.

The Hugo writing format works by structuring your content into categories that help parents identify whether content is safe or not. These categories include:

1. Profanity
2. Violence
3. Sexual content
4. Discriminatory language
5. Drug or alcohol-related content
6. Other sensitive topics

By classifying content into these categories, parents can create a system of rules that dictate what their children can and cannot access online.

For instance, you can set up filters that block websites that contain excessive profanity or violence. Additionally, you can block websites that have sexual content or any discriminatory language.

There are several tools parents can use to implement the Hugo writing format approach. One such tool is parental controls. Parental controls allow parents to set up specific rules for their children's internet access.

These rules can range from setting time limits to restricting access to specific websites. They can also set up content filters that block access to inappropriate content.

In recent years, many web browsers have introduced built-in parental control features. For instance, Google Chrome has a feature known as SafeSearch, which filters out explicit content from search results.

However, it's worth noting that no method is foolproof. Parenting requires continuous learning, adaptation, and being vigilant in staying updated on the latest threats on the internet.

Further, parents should educate their children on the dangers of inappropriate content online and encourage them to speak up in case they come across such content.

In conclusion, parenting hacks such as the Hugo writing format offer an innovative solution to the ubiquitous problem of raunchy online content. By utilizing the Hugo writing format and other tools such as parental controls and safe search, parents can help safeguard their children's internet access and ensure that they have a safe and enjoyable online experience.

Completely preventing your children from accessing adult content on the internet isn't possible, but some software programs and apps can help you protect them — and prevent them — from most of the content, you'd rather they not see.

 
##   Blocking Software and Apps  
 

Plenty of good choices are available if you want to use one of the many site-blocking programs. Some programs are designed to monitor your child's activities on mobile devices and computers. 

 

NetNanny is highly rated and monitors, restricts, or controls your children's internet viewing. If your child uses an Android or iOS mobile device, reliable parental control monitoring apps include MamaBear and Qustodio.

 
##   Free Parental Protection Options  
 

Before you start shopping for software, you can take some free steps to protect your kids.

 

If your family uses a Windows computer to search the internet, set up Windows parental controls. This step is effective, but don't stop there. You can also enable parental controls on your router, your kids' game consoles, and their mobile devices. Even YouTube has parental controls.

 

A couple of examples are SafeSearch with Google Family Link and Internet Explorer's parental controls.

 

Google Chrome doesn't have built-in parental controls, but Google encourages you to add your children to its Google Family Link program. With it, you can approve or block apps your child wants to download from Google's Play Store, see how much time your kids spend on their apps, and use SafeSearch to restrict their access to explicit websites in any browser. 

 

To activate SafeSearch and filter explicit search results in Google Chrome and other browsers:

 
- Open Google's Search Settings.
 - Check the box next to Turn on SafeSearch, in the SafeSearch filters section.
 - Click Lock SafeSearch to prevent your children from turning SafeSearch off.
 - Log in to your Google account when asked.
 - Click Lock SafeSearch.
 - Click Back to Search settings.
 - Click Save at the bottom of the page.

 
##   Restrict Browsing With Internet Explorer  
 

Open the Content Advisor window to block adult websites in Internet Explorer.

 

Open Google's Search Settings.

 

Check the box next to Turn on SafeSearch, in the SafeSearch filters section.

 

Click Lock SafeSearch to prevent your children from turning SafeSearch off.

 

Log in to your Google account when asked.

 

Click Lock SafeSearch.

 

Click Back to Search settings.

 

Click Save at the bottom of the page.

 

If you're using IE 10 or 11, you'll have to enable Content Advisor, however, it's not supported in Windows 10 version 1607. If you're using IE9, you can get to Content Advisor from Internet Explorer instead of using the command below. Go to Tools > Internet Options and then click the Content tab.

 
- Open the Run dialog box with the WIN+R keyboard shortcut.
 - Copy this command:
 - RunDll32.exe msrating.dll,RatingSetupUI
 - Paste the command into the Run dialog box.
 - Click OK.

 

These are your options in Content Advisor:

 
Microsoft no longer supports Internet Explorer and recommends that you update to the newer Edge browser. Head to their site to download the newest version.
 

Open the Run dialog box with the WIN+R keyboard shortcut.

 

Copy this command:

 

RunDll32.exe msrating.dll,RatingSetupUI

 

Paste the command into the Run dialog box.

 

Click OK.

 
- Ratings: Set rating levels for language, nudity, sex, violence, and other categories.
 - Approved Sites: List any websites your children are allowed to see even if they're blocked with the rating setting. You can also explicitly block websites if a rating doesn't restrict it.
 - General: Allow or block your child from seeing websites that have no rating. You can also use this area to restrict Content Advisor settings with a password; the password also lets you unblock a website on-demand if it's blocked for your children but you want to give them one-time access.

 
Parental controls are only effective when your child is using a device to which the parental controls are applied. For example, blocking adult sites at home does not block their phone, nor does blocking access on their phone block mature websites at school, etc. However, most schools have strict adult content blockers enabled anyway.
