It doesn't matter if you're updating device drivers, adjusting system resources, finding Device Manager error codes, or even just checking in on a device's status—you'll need to open this utility before you can do any of it.

 
##   How to Open Device Manager via Control Panel

Open Control Panel. In Windows 11, search for it from the search utility on the taskbar.

 

In some versions of Windows 10 and 8, assuming you're using a keyboard or mouse, the fastest way is through the Power User Menu—just press the WIN (Windows) key and the X key together.

- In Windows 11, 10 and 8, select Hardware and Sound. You could also jump right to Device Manager through the Power User Menu and not have to go through Control Panel.In Windows 7, choose System and Security.In Windows Vista, select System and Maintenance.In Windows XP, pick Performance and Maintenance.

The command-line method really comes in handy when you need to bring up Device Manager but your mouse won't work or your computer is having a problem that prevents you from using it normally.

 

While you probably won't ever need to open it this way, you should know that it's also available in all versions of Windows via Computer Management, part of the suite of built-in utilities called Administrative Tools.

 

Device Manager takes on a slightly different look in Computer Management. Just select it from the left margin and then use it as an integrated feature of the utility on the right.

 

Another method that works in Windows 7 is through GodMode. This is a special folder that gives you access to tons of settings and controls found throughout the operating system. If you already use GodMode, opening Device Manager there might be your preferred way to access it.
