Let’s see what you need and how you can make the Enameled glass in Subnautica Below Zero.

How To Make The Enameled Glass In Subnautica Below Zero?
 

To forge the Enameled glass you will need two Quartz and stalker teeth. While quartz is very easy to find and you can find them lying around even at 10-20 meters of depth, getting the stalker’s teeth is the difficult part. To get the Stalker’s teeth you’ll need to find an area full of stalkers. This can be a bit difficult which is why we have another way. Try dropping a large chunk of metal debris at one place. Stalkers are attracted to debris so in sometime, you will see stalkers around the debris. Wait for them to finish whatever they do with the debris, after which they will drop their teeth.
 
Once you have gathered the stalker teeth and two Quartz get back to the base to the Fabricator. At the Fabricator, go to the Resources tab under which you will find Glass and in the tab, it will also mention the ingredients needed to forge it. Use the Quartz to form the Glass. After forming glass combine it with the Stalker teeth which will give you the Enameled glass. There are multiple uses of Enameled glass. We recommend you collect as many Quartz and Stalker teeth as you can.
