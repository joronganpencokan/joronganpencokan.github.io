Master Your Google Now Notifications with These Hidden Tricks – Click Here to Find Out How!

Google Now is an excellent virtual assistant tool that is designed to make life easier for you. It is created to provide you with useful information based on your likes, searches, and preferences. One of the standout features of Google Now is the notifications system, which keeps you abreast of all your interests, from sports, news, weather, and more. However, what most users do not know is that Google Now has several hidden tricks that can enable you to master your notifications and become an expert in getting the most out of your virtual assistant.

In this article, we will show you some of the hidden tricks for Google Now notifications that will improve your overall user experience. So why don't you sit back and relax as we show you how to master your Google Now notifications like a pro?

1. Mute Notifications for Specific Topics

One of the essential features of Google Now notifications is that it helps you stay up-to-date with news and current events in real-time. However, sometimes, you may not want to receive notifications on specific topics. For instance, you may want to exclude a particular team or a celebrity from your news feed. Thankfully, Google Now has a solution for that.

To mute notifications for a specific topic, open the Google App on your device and tap on the three-horizontal lines icon on the top left corner. Select 'Settings,' then 'your feed.' You will see a list of interests, and you can mute notifications for any topic you do not want to see. This way, you will only receive notifications on the topics that interest you the most.

2. Create Custom Notifications

Another exciting feature that you may not know about is Google Now's ability to create custom notifications. This means that you can set custom alerts for specific events or reminders depending on your preference. For instance, if you have a doctor's appointment, you can create a reminder to notify you before the day of the appointment.

To create a custom notification, go to the Google App, and access the 'Settings' menu. Then, tap on 'Notifications,' and scroll down to 'Customize.' From there, you can set custom notifications for specific events or reminders, which will help you stay on top of your to-do list.

3. Snooze Notifications

Sometimes, you may not be in a position to read or respond to notifications, especially when you are in a meeting or in a noisy place. In such cases, Google Now's 'snooze notifications' feature can be of great assistance. This feature allows you to put notifications on hold for a specific period of time until you are ready to take action.

To use this feature, swipe right on the notification, and then select the clock icon. From there, you can choose the duration for the notification to be snoozed, and when the time elapses, you will receive an alert to remind you to read or respond to it.

4. Personalize Your Notifications

Google Now's notifications system is designed to provide you with information on topics that are relevant to you based on your search history, location, and interests. However, you may have specific preferences that are not taken into account by the system. In such cases, you can personalize your notifications to suit your needs.

To do this, open the Google App and access the settings menu. Then, tap on 'Notifications,' and scroll down to 'Personalize.' Here, you can select the type of notifications you want to receive, as well as choose the notification tone that appeals to you the most.

In conclusion, mastering Google Now notifications is all about discovering the hidden features and using them to your advantage. With these tips, you can personalize your notifications, mute topics that do not interest you, create custom notifications and snooze notifications when you are not ready to respond. By doing so, you will improve your overall user experience, save time, and get the most out of your virtual assistant. So why don't you try out these hidden tricks today and become an expert in Google Now notifications?

Google’s virtual assistant app can offer precise recommendations that may even trick you into thinking it can read your mind. Google Now can recommend the latest news matching your interests, give traffic details about your commute, show the weather, the score of your favorite sports team and much more. If you are only using Google Now for information, then there is a chance its notifications might be turning out to be a little annoying.
 
If you are tired of continuously seeing notifications about the latest cat videos, then Google Now lets you customize what you want to be notified about and what to skip. In this post we will show how to control Google Now cards notifications and how to completely turn them off (if need be).
 
## Customize Google Now Notifications
 
If there is a particular notification that is bugging you, then you can turn it off and still receive other important notifications. Open the Google Now app by swiping from the bottom to top or holding the “Home” button (depending on your device). Tap on the hamburger menu at the top left corner and select “Settings.”
 

 
Now tap on “Now Cards.” Under “Notifications” you will see all the categories that Google will show you notifications for. Tap on the slider next to the one you don’t want to be notified about, and notifications for it will be disabled. You can disable notifications about sports scores, weather, news and videos, traffic and more.
 
## Disable Google Now Notifications
 
If you like the Google Now recommendations but are tired of all the notifications it is sending you, then you can also completely turn off all notifications. In the “Now Cards” option tap on the slider next to “Notifications,” and all the notifications will be turned off. You can still see Google Now cards by visiting the app, but notifications will not bug you anymore.
 
## Disable Google Now Cards
 
If you don’t use Google Now cards at all and are just confused about a machine periodically telling you what is best for you, it might be a good idea to completely opt out of Google Now. In the same “Now Cards” menu tap on the slider next to “Show Cards.” A prompt will show up asking whether you want to turn off Google Now Cards on this device or all of your devices. Check the checkbox if you want to disable cards on all your devices; otherwise, directly tap on “Turn off” to disable Google Now Cards.
 
This will only disable Google Now Cards; you can still use Google Now commands and voice control features.
 
## Conclusion
 
Google Now notifications can get a little out of control, especially if you have accidentally activated them. I personally like Google Now cards but don’t want to be frequently notified about them. That is why I keep the notifications disabled and manually see the cards when I get some free time.
