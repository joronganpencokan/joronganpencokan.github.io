This article explains how to open and convert files that use the AVC file extension. These files can be one of three formats: a Kaspersky virus database file (most likely), an Avid Media Composer script, or an AVTECH video.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- No need to open or convert Kaspersky files.If file is Avid Media Composer script, open with Avid Media Composer. To convert, select File > Save As or Export.Use software that came with AVTECH hardware to open those AVC files. Use Cisdem Video Player to convert.

 
##   Opening an AVC File That's a Kaspersky Virus Database File  
 

A file with the AVC file extension is most likely a database file that the Kaspersky antivirus software uses to store information regarding updates to the program. They're normally named with an update number, like base008.avc.

 
AVC also stands for Advanced Video Coding, which is a common video compression standard. It's similar to the AVCHD video file format for storing high-definition video content.
 

You can't and won't have to open these AVC files. They're not files you'd open deliberately, like opening a document or another readily usable file. These files are used by the program on an as-needed basis without any intention of being opened by you.

 
##   Opening an AVC File That's an Avid Media Composer File  
 

It's possible that your AVC files were created with the Script Window in Avid Media Composer and contain transcripts meant to be joined with a video.

 

If your AVC file is an Avid Media Composer script, you can open it via the Avid Media Composer program. You might also be able to use CyberLink PowerDVD and Sony's Vegas Pro to open them. Since they're scripts, it's possible a text editor may also be able to read them.

 
##   Opening an AVC File That's an AVTECH Video File  
 

Although they're not as common as the formats we already mentioned, some AVC files could be video files stored on AVTECH DVRs or cameras.

 

This isn't a common video format. It's unlikely that a regular video player or editor can open and play one. Your best option for opening this AVC file type is via the software that came with your AVTECH hardware. AVTECH's CMS software download page might help.

 
##   How to Convert an AVC File  
 

Your conversion process will be different depending on the type of AVC file you have.

 
Visit AVTECH's software web page to learn more about software that works with AVTECH files.
 
- If your AVC file is a Kaspersky database file, converting it would be unnecessary and unlikely.
 - If your AVC file is an Avid Media Composer script, convert it by using the File > Save As or Export function of the program you used to open the file.
 - If your AVC file is a video file used with an AVTECH product, you can convert it to an AVI file (a much more common video format) using Cisdem Video Player.

 
##   What to Do if You Can't Open the AVC File  
 

If your file doesn't work with any of the programs mentioned on this page, verify that you correctly identified the file extension. Many file extensions share the same letters and numbers, so mixing them up is easy.

 
You might also be able to convert an AVTECH AVC file using another free video converter, but none of the ones we typically recommend explicitly say so. If that doesn't work out, use Video Player to make an AVI file and then use one of those converter tools to convert that AVI file to a different format like MP4, MOV, or whatever you're after.
 

For example, ACV files can easily be confused with AVC files. If that's the file you actually have, you'd need a totally different program on your computer in order to open it.

 

If you know your file has the .AVC file extension, try looking through the file as if it were a text document, using a text editor like Windows Notepad. You might find some information at the very top or bottom that describes the format, which you can then use to research the program that made the file.
