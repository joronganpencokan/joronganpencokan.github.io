Hot Wheels Unleashed is a revisit to the nostalgia world of toy cars when imagination was the only power. I remember collecting various models, showing them off to my friends, and feeling proud of the cool-looking plastic cars I have. Developed by Milestone, we will find in this review if this game deserves a place on the shelves. Or it’s a failed attempt to merge racing game mechanism flavored with Hot Wheels branding to grab attention. Frankly speaking, being a AAA game fan who mostly spends hours running behind graphics and gameplay mechanics it was not easy for me to settle with this game. I will share with you in detail my experience with Hot Wheels Unleashed.
 
## Hot Wheels Unleashed Review
 
For the purpose of this review, I have split the game into three distinct parts. This will make it easier for me to analyze the game and convey to gamers what to expect from this game. But before I start, I also want to share my perspective on this review. I didn’t just pull out Dirt 5, F1, Nascar, or NFS series for comparison. Hot Wheels Unleashed has a different position, this game is designed for fun, for having a good time together with a touch of homestay feeling. Keeping that in mind I will preferrable speak everything about the gameplay, racing mechanics, whether it’s enjoyable or recurring, etc.
 

 
Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fun game to play. Pull out your favorite wheels on the toy race tracks with some boost and ride on. Pull the trigger on the right spot for a stunt. It is not an aww factor for serious gamers, but fun for kids and for those who still have a kid in them. Drifting is fun and easy, the game does not throw much challenge on your face. It is practically designed for having a good time. As usually racing game does not feature any kind of story mode. You pick a vehicle, customize it, and hit the tracks. You can decorate your basement, customize your car and even challenge friends around the globe in the multiplayer section.
 
Hot Wheels Unleashed also throws different types of difficulties, it relies on if you want to try out an easy mode to explore the tracks first or pro enough to cut down the traffic. The game is completely focused on toy cars, there are tons of amazing models to unlock. I enjoyed the gameplay for a short while because I had already gone through games like Diablo 2 Resurrected, Cyberpunk 2022, etc. These big titles are sometimes strong enough to astonish you or fall on the face due to a hasty development cycle. Hot Wheels Unleashed is nothing like that. It is a joyful game with vibrant colors. If as a parent you are scared to buy games for your kids, this one is something you must not ignore.

The visuals are probably the best part of the game and rightly so. The iconic orange tracks are a treat and when you combine them with the background, it actually feels that you are part of a Toy Story movie. All the cars are immaculately detailed which makes them a joy to watch. Another cool feature that I noticed was the tiny scratches that pop up on the bodywork of the cars after a bit of bumping. The game is pretty sorted out visually and on our PS4 test-bed, it seemed to function quite well. You can choose from a variety of locations and more as you progress through the game. This allows for a very appealing and pleasing experience.
 
The one thing that stood out in the review for Hot Wheels Unleashed was the amount of customization available. You will now be able to create and use your own liveries for the iconic cars in the franchise. This adds a touch of personalization to the game as you tear through the preset locations. You also can customize your basement room. From walls, arcades to trophy cabinets and kitchen tops. Almost every element can be interacted with and customized to your liking. And lastly, the Track Creator. This is a nostalgic process as you get to build and make your own track in the game. You can add and combine various different elements, starting platforms, and so much more. It is a rabbit hole worth falling into if you want to recapture that feeling of connecting the orange tracks.

### Verdict
 
Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fun-loving game for young gamers. It is a break from the chaos, and if you had ever collected Hot Wheels toys you will enjoy this more. There is a lot to do in this game, but I am also less confident how seriously gamers can adopt it. Like Fall Guys or Among Us, such games do fall in the same category. Where it’s less about gameplay and mechanics, and more about having fun together. For me Hot Wheels Unleashed is a title that falls in this category, I will not prefer to push it in the race of AAA games where lots of filters are applied. This will snatch the essence of Hot Wheels Unleashed’s joyful world.
 
Overall I enjoyed playing Hot Wheels Unleashed. After trying out AC Valhalla, Watch Dogs Legion, Back4Blood, for a very long time I was looking for a break. I got chances to try out Life is Strange True Colors and then Hot Wheels Unleashed that served as a dessert after the main course.
