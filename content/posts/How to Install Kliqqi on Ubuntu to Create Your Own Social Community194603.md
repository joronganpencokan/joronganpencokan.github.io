   define('DATABASE_NAME', 'kliqqi');
   define('DATABASE_USER', 'root');
   define('DATABASE_PASS', 'yourpassword');
   define('DATABASE_HOST', 'localhost');
   ```

5. After you have updated the database settings, you can visit your Kliqqi installation in your browser to complete the installation process.
