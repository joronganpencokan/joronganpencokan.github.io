# You won't believe how easy it is to secretly read messages on Whatsapp - learn how to turn off read receipts now!

If you're an avid Whatsapp user, you know how important it is to stay on top of your messages. But did you know that there's a way to secretly read messages without the sender knowing? It's called turning off read receipts, and it's a game-changer. In this article, we'll walk you through the steps of turning off read receipts so you can read messages in peace.

First, let's talk about what read receipts are. When you send a message on Whatsapp, the app notifies the sender when it's been delivered and when it's been read. This can be handy if you're trying to coordinate plans with someone or if you want to make sure your message was received. But it can also be a curse if you like having privacy and don't want people to know when you've read their messages.

To turn off read receipts on Whatsapp, follow these steps:

1. Open Whatsapp and go to Settings.
2. Click on Account, then Privacy.
3. Scroll down to Read Receipts and toggle it off.

That's it! It's that simple. Now when you receive a message on Whatsapp, the sender won't be notified when you've read it. You're free to read messages on your own time and without any pressure to respond immediately.

Of course, there are downsides to turning off read receipts. If you're in the middle of a group chat, for example, the other members will still see when everyone else has read the message except for you. This can make it hard to keep up with the conversation if everyone else is responding based on the assumption that you've read the message too.

Another downside is that if you turn off read receipts for someone, they might take it personally. They might start wondering why you're not responding to their messages, or they might think you're ignoring them altogether. So it's important to communicate with the people you're chatting with if you decide to turn off read receipts.

In conclusion, turning off read receipts on Whatsapp is a simple way to gain some privacy and read messages on your own terms. But it's important to be aware of the downsides too. If you're ready to turn off read receipts, follow the steps outlined above, and enjoy your newfound privacy.

##   About WhatsApp Read Receipts  
 

WhatsApp Read Receipts look like checkmarks. When you send a message, a grey checkmark appears next to the time stamp. Two checkmarks appear upon delivery to the recipient. When the recipient reads it, two blue checkmarks appear. In a group chat, both checkmarks turn blue after every participant of the group chat opens the message.

 

If you don't see two blue checkmarks next to a message you sent, the recipient hasn't opened it, one of you turn off read receipts, the recipient blocked you, or one of you has connection issues.

 

Read receipts are a two-way street. If you turn off read receipts, you won't be able to tell when others have read yours.

 

There's no way to turn off the read receipts for group chats or play receipts for voice messages on Android or iOS.
