## Ingredients:

- 1 can of black beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small red onion, diced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
- 1 lime, juiced
- Tortillas
- Toppings like diced tomatoes, chopped lettuce, and sour cream

## Instructions:

1. In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add in the diced red onion and sauté for about five minutes, or until the onion is soft and slightly caramelized.

2. Add the minced garlic to the skillet and sauté for another minute. You don't want the garlic to burn, so be sure to stir it frequently.

3. Next, add in the black beans, ground cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir everything together and cook for about five minutes, or until the beans are heated through and the spices have melded together.

4. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the chopped cilantro and lime juice. This will give the bean mixture a fresh and zesty flavor that will perfectly complement the other taco toppings.

5. Warm up your tortillas in the microwave or on a skillet. Once they're ready, it's time to assemble the tacos!

6. Spoon some of the black bean mixture onto each warmed tortilla. Next, top the beans with diced tomatoes, chopped lettuce, and a dollop of sour cream.

7. Roll up each taco, making sure to fold in the sides as you go. Enjoy your mouthwatering vegetarian tacos with your family and friends!
