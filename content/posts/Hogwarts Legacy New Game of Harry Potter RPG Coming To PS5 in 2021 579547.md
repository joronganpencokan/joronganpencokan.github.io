The world of Hogwarts Legacy promises to be huge and diverse, with different areas to explore such as the Forbidden Forest, Hogsmeade Village, and even the surrounding wizardry world. You'll encounter all sorts of magical creatures and artifacts, some of which will be friendly and some of which will be hostile.

Combat in the game will take place in real-time, and players will be able to use various spells and items to defeat enemies. The game also promises to have a morality system, where your choices and actions will affect your character's reputation and standing at Hogwarts.

One of the biggest selling points of Hogwarts Legacy is its breathtaking visuals, which take full advantage of the PS5's hardware capabilities. The game features stunning graphics, realistic animations, and dynamic weather and lighting effects that will transport you straight into the world of Harry Potter.

Hogwarts Legacy is set to be released in 2021, and fans are eagerly anticipating its arrival.
