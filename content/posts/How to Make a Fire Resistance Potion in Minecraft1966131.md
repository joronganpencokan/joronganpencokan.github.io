Are you tired of losing all your items and dying in lava in Minecraft? Fear not, as there is a way to protect yourself against the fiery dangers of the game - Fire Resistance Potions. These handy potions will give you temporary immunity to fire and lava, ensuring that you can explore the nether and encounter blazes without worry. Here's how you can make your very own Fire Resistance Potions in Minecraft.

Ingredients:

- Nether Wart: You will need one Nether Wart, which can be found in Nether Fortresses in the Nether dimension.
