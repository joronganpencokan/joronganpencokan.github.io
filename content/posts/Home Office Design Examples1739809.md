Tired of working in your home office because it's not working for you? These examples utilize a variety of home office furniture arrangements and room shapes that are perfect for any at-home worker or telecommuter. 

 

You aren't working in a cubicle anymore, so let your personality and personal preferences in the way you work the best guide you in creating your ultimate home office. It's easy to rearrange your home office without worrying about getting permission from your boss or co-workers.

 
##   Strip/Basic Home Office Layout Sample  
 

This is the most simple and basic layout. When space is at a premium, the strip/basic layout is probably the best to start with because it can be used in a variety of spaces, especially when sharing living space is required.

 

This home office layout is the most economical and provides you with the workspace you need to begin working. Plus, it's quite easy to add on or build upon this layout to create others that you have seen or wish to design later. 

 
##   Using a Corner Layout for a Home Office  
 

A corner layout works well with square rooms or when you're using part of another room. It looks great and optimizes the overall space.

 

One of the important points to keep in mind with a corner layout is the position of any windows. If you happen to be facing a street, you might not wish for anyone and everyone to be able to see you.

 

Another consideration will be the placement of outlets and phone jacks. While this won't pose serious problems, you don't want to be using a lot of electrical extension cords. Try to arrange your workstation closest to the outlets so that your surge protectors can be plugged directly into them.

 
##   Sample Corridor Home Office Layout  
 

This long and narrow layout works well for use in long hallways or closets that aren't being used. When there's an opening to the room on both ends, this is the best office layout to use.

 

The key to successfully using this home office layout is to remember that there must be a lot of storage space. Since this area could see heavy traffic when you aren't working, it's important to keep things neat and tidy.

 

Bi-fold doors can be used to enclose the office area when not in use. Heavy drapes are another alternative.

 
##   L-Shape Home Office Design  
 

An L-shaped home office layout lets you take advantage of available space and is well suited for situations where home office workers are sharing a room.

 

This plan provides a large workspace and you can often make it large enough for more than one person to use, if need be. You can also adjust the workspace to include storage space and room for all home office equipment.

 

Make sure you keep track of where electrical outlets and phone jacks are located. With a desk, this long, blocked access can be a real problem.

 
##   Use an L-Shaped Corridor for a Home Office  
 

L Shaped corridors are common at the top of stairs or on the main floor of some older homes.

 

A neatly arranged home office can be created using an L Shaped corridor in your home. Use narrow bookcases and a long narrow desk to take ​the best advantage of this space. Leave room for your office chair to be tucked away when not in use (so make sure your chair can actually fit under the desk).

 

You may have to add power and phone outlets to ensure that all your office equipment will work properly in this location. Coordinated furnishings that tie in with the general decor of the L Shaped corridor will work best.

 
##   Go in Circles in Your Home Office  
 

Rooms that have rounded walls can make an impressive home office and provide you with a wonderful view. A room with this kind of unique shape can be designed to include work areas for your computer equipment and reading areas.

 

Working with a uniquely shaped room may require that you have custom-designed furniture for your home office in order to take advantage of the available space and fit with curved walls.

 
##   T-Shape Layout  
 

This layout is similar to the Basic layout that tops this page, but has more workspace and can be used by more than one person. As you can see, both persons can share the middle area of the desk while still having their own cubicle-like areas.

 

This layout is very useful if your room provides the space. It's ideal when you have lots of equipment or need an enlarged work environment.

 
##   T-Shaped Rooms Offer Home Office Potential  
 

Using a T Shaped room will help you to keep your work and home office organized. This is crucial if it's hard for you to separate from the two.

 

A T Shaped room will provide plenty of room to design a functional home office and space for storage. This shape of this room enables you to have a quiet and private workspace for your home office.

 

Like with most home office setups, planning is key. Arrange your home office furnishings in such a way to take advantage of lighting, windows, power outlets, and phone jacks.

 
##   Sample U-Shape Home Office Layout  
 

This layout provides a great deal of workspace. You can use hutches on different sections for additional storage.

 

This layout can be used in small or large rooms. Another nice feature is that two people can quite easily share this space and not get in the way of each other.

 

You can create the basic U-shape with one desk and tables or islands to the sides. There are also U-shaped units available from some office furniture stores.

 

Creating the U-shape with the peninsula will take a little more work since it does involve more space. If your future plans include having more computers then this is quite possibly your best bet.

 

This layout also works well in shared rooms. It makes the most of space and room for storage without spreading into the other area.
