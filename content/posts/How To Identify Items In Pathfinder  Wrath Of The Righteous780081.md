As you defeat many enemies in Pathfinder: Wrath Of The Righteous, you will obtain a lot of Items. Some of which are unidentified. Here I am going to show you how you can Identify Items in Pathfinder: Wrath Of The Righteous (WOTR).
 
## How to Identify Items in Pathfinder: Wrath Of The Righteous (WOTR)
 

 
Like I mentioned before when you loot areas or defeat waves of enemies you will get certain loot that is Unidentified Items. At face value, they will look like ordinary and worthless Items to you but there is more to those Items than you think. These Items have secret magical stat enhancements. These will prove to be useful as you and some of them will be needed for the game.
 
So basically you will need to identify the Items in order to use them. To do so you will need a character that has the Knowledge for the Knowledge Arcana skill. The Knowledge Arcana skill is related to characters that have knowledge in all things magic like magical items, magic lore, potions, and spells. This skill will allow you to identify those items, revealing what stats they contain. You will need a Knowledge Arcana of level 4 at the minimum. This will let you identify all of the unidentified items, most of them at least. Some of these items will require you to have high Knowledge Arcana levels. In such cases, you may take them to a shopkeeper who will identify them for you.
 
### Things to keep in mind:
 
So having higher Knowledge Arcana stats, the better your chances of identifying your items. Ensure no matter what character you build, it must have some attributes in the Magic Stat. Without it, you may not be able to use the Knowledge Arcana Skill. Also, keep your Knowledge Arcana Skill level at 4 or higher.
 
This was all about how to identify items in Pathfinder: Wrath Of The Righteous (WOTR). Hopefully, this has helped you in making your playthrough a little easier. You can also check our guides on Mythic Paths and Companions in Pathfinder: Wrath Of The Righteous (WOTR).
