### When is the right time to use them?
 
You need to use them right when you feel that ghost activity is increasing. This can be understood when lights start to flash or if you hear ghost activity nearby in the form of sound or temperature drop.
 
Just when the ghost is about to enter hunting mode, you need to use the smudge sticks to buy some time for yourself. You must find a place to hide immediately because the effect of these sticks is temporary. Ghosts won’t attack you while they are burning.
 
Remember that you can use them until they burn out but re-use is not possible. So keep more than one with you at all times. Also note that while the sticks are burning, you can unequip it and equip some other item too.
 
Lastly, if an active hunt is happening, these sticks will not stop it. Instead, the ghost will stop chasing you for a few seconds before starting the hunt once again.
 
So, this is how you can cleanse the area with smudge sticks especially in places like a ghost room. Ward off spooky entities with it and stay safe, even though it is for a little while.
