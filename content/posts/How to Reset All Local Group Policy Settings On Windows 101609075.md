Windows 10 Local Group Policy is an incredibly useful tool that allows users to configure and customize various settings on their computer. It provides a range of options, from controlling privacy and security settings to managing automatic updates and configuring network connections. However, over time, users may end up making some modifications that can result in issues and system errors. In such cases, resetting the Local Group Policy to its default settings can prove to be beneficial. In this article, we will explore the steps to reset Local Group Policy Settings on Windows 10.

What is Local Group Policy?

Local Group Policy is a built-in feature in Windows operating systems that provides a centralized way to manage computer settings. It allows administrators to control and manage the security and configuration settings of local accounts, as well as network accounts in a domain environment. This feature is especially useful for organizations that need to manage multiple computers and users, but it can also be utilized by individual users to customize their computer settings.

Why Reset Local Group Policy Settings?

One of the most common issues that can arise due to Local Group Policy modifications is the inability to access certain features or applications on the computer. This can occur when users make changes to settings that are crucial for system operation or security. Other issues such as slow system performance or frequent crashes can also arise due to Local Group Policy changes. When it comes to resolving these kinds of issues, resetting Local Group Policy to its default settings is a simple and effective solution.

Steps to Reset Local Group Policy Settings on Windows 10

1. Open the Run command by pressing the Windows key + R, then type "gpedit.msc" and hit Enter. This will launch the Local Group Policy Editor.

2. In the Local Group Policy Editor, select "Computer Configuration" and then click "Administrative Templates."

3. In the Administrative Templates section, right-click on "All Settings" and select "Filter Options." Under the "State" section, choose "Enabled" and "Not Configured." Click "OK."

4. After applying the filter options, expand "Administrative Templates" again, and click on "System." 

5. Next, right-click on "System," select "Filter Options," and apply the same State Filter options as in step 3. Click "OK."

6. Expand "System" and select the "Group Policy" folder. On the right-hand side, you'll see a setting called "Configure user Group Policy loopback processing mode." Double-click on it.

8. Close the Local Group Policy Editor and restart your computer.

After following these steps, the Local Group Policy settings on your Windows 10 computer will be reset to their default values. Note that any changes you may have made to the settings will be lost, and you will have to configure them again. However, resetting Local Group Policy can help to alleviate system issues, improve performance, and provide a fresh start for configuring your computer settings.
