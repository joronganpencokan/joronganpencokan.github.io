Zip files are like boxes that can store multiple items, and when you want to access these items, you must unzip them. When you click on a zipped file, your Chromebook will automatically unzip the file, and you'll be able to access its contents. Chromebooks come with an inbuilt app that enables the user to manage zipped files. The app is known as Files or the Chrome OS Files app.
