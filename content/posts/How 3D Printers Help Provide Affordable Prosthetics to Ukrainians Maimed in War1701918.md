Revolutionary Solution: 3D Printers Bring Hope to War-Torn Ukraine Providing Low-Cost Prosthetics!

War-torn countries such as Ukraine have a devastating impact on the lives of millions of people. Innocent victims are often left with serious injuries and disabilities due to the constant conflict. A lack of resources and funding leaves many without access to essential medical care, including prosthetics. However, a revolutionary solution is changing the game and providing hope for those in need. Thanks to 3D printers, low-cost prosthetics are now available for the people of Ukraine.

Prosthetics are an essential aspect of rehabilitation for those who have suffered losses as a result of war. However, traditional prosthetics can cost thousands of dollars, leaving many with no viable option. In Ukraine, the need for low-cost prosthetics is urgent, and 3D printers have come to the rescue.

One organization, the Ukrainian company, SocialBoost, has teamed up with the charity, Handicap International, to create 3D printed prosthetics for those in need. SocialBoost CEO, Vitaliy Bondarenko, explains how it works. "First, we scan the client's limb, and the software creates the structure for the prosthesis," he says. "We then print the prosthesis using a 3D printer, and the final step is to assemble the hardware, artificial limb, the straps, and a pad."

The process is far simpler and dramatically cheaper than traditional prosthetics. Although the initial cost of a 3D printer is high, the operating costs are minimal, making the production of prosthetics affordable for most Ukrainians.

The impact of these low-cost prosthetics on the lives of those in need is immeasurable. Mykhailo, a resident of the Donetsk region of Ukraine, lost one of his arms due to the conflict. After arriving at the SocialBoost center, he was blown away by their new approach to prosthetics. "Before, I couldn't imagine having a prosthesis, but now I can," he said. "I was impressed with how it was made, and it fits me perfectly."

Not only has the use of 3D printers helped provide vital prosthetics, but it has also helped the local economy by creating jobs. SocialBoost has already produced over 100 prosthetics in its three centers in Ukraine, and they plan to open more centers in the future.

The use of 3D printers has revolutionized the way prosthetics are made and provided a solution for those with serious injuries. The low-cost option will allow people to have access to essential medical care and improve their quality of life in the process. As Ukraine continues to recover from years of war, the use of 3D printers is bringing hope to those who need it most. 

In conclusion, the use of 3D printers to produce affordable prosthetics is a revolutionary solution that has shown great potential to make life easier for those who have suffered serious injuries during warfare. The impact of such innovations is immeasurable, and the low cost involved will ensure that most Ukrainians have access to essential medical care. The success of this initiative will surely inspire other organizations across the globe to follow suit, and it is hoped that every person who needs a prosthetic will have access to it in the near future.

Thousands of Ukrainians have lost limbs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and 3D printers are helping supply prosthetics.

 
- The use of 3D printers is allowing victims of the war in Ukraine to get prosthetic limbs faster. The process can drop the cost of a prosthetic to under $10,000 per limb.The company estimates that more than 10,000 prosthetic limbs are needed in Ukraine.

 

Unlimited Tomorrow, a maker of prosthetic arms, is donating hundreds of replacement limbs to the war-torn country. The victims will get access to their prosthetic limbs through 3D scanning, 3D modeling, and 3D printing. This process shortens the timing and reduces the price of a high-tech prosthetic arm from $20,000-$100,000 to under $10,000 per limb.

 

"3D printing enables TrueLimb to be uniquely personalized to each user from the shape, size, and skin tone to match the opposing limb perfectly," Easton LaChapelle, the CEO and founder of Unlimited Tomorrow, told Lifewire in an email interview. "3D printing also allows us to decrease costs and remain nimble from a design perspective. We are not bound by expensive molds or traditional manufacturing techniques."

 
##   Lighter Limbs  
 

Using 3D printers, which make a 3d object from a computer model, lets Unlimited Tomorrow make a robust but lightweight product, LaChappelle said. Weight is one of the biggest challenges in upper limb prosthetics, and the company achieved a weight of 1-1.5 pounds. 3D printing also allows Unlimited Tomorrow to make its limbs anywhere in the world. The company estimates that more than 10,000 prosthetic limbs are needed in Ukraine due to war injuries. 

 

"While initial prosthetics will be shipped to Ukraine from the US, we can foresee a scenario in the not-too-distant future where color 3D printers are on the ground in Ukraine," LaChappelle said. "Making it that much faster and economical to get victims the help they so urgently need." 

 

Unlimited Tomorrow uses 3D scanning technology, design software, and additive manufacturing, which is the printing process of creating an object by building it one layer at a time. The key to a personalized fit is perfecting the prosthesis's socket to a person's residual limb. 

 

After an initial 3D scan of the limb, the socket model is created, and after 3D printing, test sockets are shipped to hospitals in Ukraine. Virtual consultation is used to select the best-fitting socket, after which the final TrueLimb prosthesis is additively manufactured and delivered to the hospitals. Unlimited Tomorrow then provides training resources for the bionic limb.

 

The same 3D-printing technology used by Unlimited Technology is used by many other companies as well and is helping to revolutionize the process of making prosthetic arms around the world. 3D printing allows for organic designs tailored to individuals' anatomy and produced locally or regionally. With traditional manufacturing, the ability to customize through production methods like casting, modeling, and milling is not possible, Patrick Boyd, the marketing director of EOS, a 3D printing company, told Lifewire via email. Typically, sizes for prosthetics are Small, Medium, or Large. 

 

"But by scanning the individual and leveraging medical know-how, what is produced are prosthetics that are optimized to the wearer, providing increased comfort and mobility," he added. 

 
##   The Power of 3D   
 

Prosthetic and medical device manufacturers, as well as point-of-care facilities, are using 3D printing to deliver 3D printed limbs. Companies such as ​​Partial Hand Solutions use Formlabs 3D printers like the Fuse 1 to provide functional solutions for soldiers and civilians with partial hand and finger amputations, as well as for children with more extensive prosthetic requirements, Gaurav Manchanda, the medical market development director for the 3D printing company Formlabs told Lifewire in an email interview. 

 

Prior to using 3D printing, most prosthetic fingers were made using injection molding, Manchanda said. "The parts had to be outsourced, taking two weeks to arrive, and only five sizes were available," he added. 

 

The 3D-printed limbs also allow more customization options. There is a trend among amputees to move away from the "bionic arm" paradigm and toward "low-tech," mechanical-only prostheses that are designed for functionality, Alkaios Bournias Varotsis, a product marketing manager at nTopology, a company that makes software used in prosthetic design, said via email. "The customization options that are unlocked by 3D printing will have an impact on the functionality of these devices."

 

In the future, getting a 3D-printed limb could take hours rather than weeks or months. Some healthcare organizations have on-site 3D printing capabilities that allow for a patient measurement and design that are done in one day and delivery of the prosthetic to the doctor within a few weeks for patient fitting, Boyd said. 

 

"That time for print-to-patient will compress even more in the next few years," he added.
