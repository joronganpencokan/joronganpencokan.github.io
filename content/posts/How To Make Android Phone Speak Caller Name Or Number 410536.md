# Revolutionize Your Phone: Learn How to Make Your Android Speak Caller Name or Number - Never Miss a Call Again!

Have you ever missed an important call because you did not recognize the unknown number or name flashing on your smartphone? With the increasing number of spam calls and telemarketers bombarding our phones every day, it becomes crucial to identify every incoming call before picking it up. 

Thankfully, there is an easy solution to this problem - making your Android phone speak caller name or number to you instead of just displaying it on the screen. In this article, we will guide you through the simple steps to activate this feature and help you never miss a call again.

## Step 1: Enable the 'TalkBack' Feature on Your Phone

Before your Android phone can speak caller name or number, you need to activate the 'TalkBack' feature on your device. This feature enables your phone to read everything that appears on the screen aloud, including the caller information.

To activate TalkBack, follow these quick steps:

1. Open the 'Settings' app on your Android phone
2. Scroll down and tap on 'Accessibility' 
3. Find 'TalkBack' and toggle the button to enable it
4. A pop-up message will appear, notifying you of the TalkBack feature's usage. Tap 'OK' to proceed

## Step 2: Install an App to Announce Caller's Name

Now that you have enabled the TalkBack feature on your Android phone, the next step is to install an app that will announce the caller's name or number. There are several options available on the Google Play Store, such as 'Caller Name Announcer,' 'SayMyName,' and 'Who's Calling?'

For the purpose of this article, we will use the Caller Name Announcer app. Follow these steps to download and set up the app:

1. Open the Google Play Store on your Android phone
2. Search for 'Caller Name Announcer' and install the app
3. Once the installation is complete, launch the app
4. Grant the app the necessary permissions to access your phone's call logs and contacts
5. Select the announcements you want the app to make. You can choose to get the caller's name or number, announce the call duration or battery level, etc.
6. Customize the settings as per your preference, such as the language, voice speed, and announcement frequencies.

## Step 3: Test the Feature

Now that you have enabled TalkBack and installed the Caller Name Announcer app, it's time to test the feature. Simply call your phone from another device and wait for the incoming call announcement. You should hear the app announcing the caller's name or number, along with any additional information you selected in Step 2.

## Some Things to Remember

While the feature to make your Android phone speak caller's name or number can be highly useful, there are some things to keep in mind. 

Firstly, the TalkBack feature can be quite annoying if you do not need it to read everything on your phone aloud. So, remember to disable it once you are done with the caller's announcement. 

Secondly, the Caller's Name Announcer app may not work correctly with all phones' configurations or settings. So, if you face any issues, make sure to check the app's reviews, feedback, or reach out to its support team for assistance. 

Lastly, keep in mind that constantly hearing your phone announce every incoming call can be distracting, especially in quiet or professional environments. So, use the feature sparingly and customize the announcements as per your usage or preference.

In conclusion, making your Android phone speak caller's name or number can be a game-changer, ensuring you never miss an important call again. So, follow the above-mentioned steps, test the feature, and enjoy the convenience it brings.

How great it would be if your Android phone starts announcing the name of the person who is calling you. Especially when your phone is in your pocket or not within your reach, so that you could know if the phone call is important or not. Just by hearing the name out loud, you could know if the phone call needs your attention or you can just ignore it for the moment.
 
Now, most probably this feature is not available in your device, but it can be achieved through the third-party apps available on the Google Play Store. And in this article, we are going to tell you about two such apps, which will not only announce the caller name but also the SMS sender name. Although, you’ll have to make a few settings before your phone starts speaking the incoming caller’s name. But don’t worry because we’ve got you covered.

## Make Android Phone Announce Caller Name Or Number
 
You can very easily make your phone speak the caller name out loud by using the following third-party apps.
 
### App 1: Caller Name Talker
 
Caller Name Talker is a well known Android app to enable your phone to speak caller name or ID. Apart from the “Announce Caller Name” feature, this app comes with various other features like “Announce SMS sender name”, or “Announce SMS content” and much more. The best part of this app is you can use any desired ringtone since it speaks out the name of the calling person without stopping the ringtone set by the user.
 
And the one amazing thing about this app is that it can read out caller name in languages other than English. The speech-language can be changed into other languages including German, Hindi, Spanish, French, Croatian, and Italian.
 
To make this app to work, you have to perform some additional steps which are explained below.
 
1. Install Caller Name Talker app from Google Play Store if you haven’t already.
 
2. Launch the app and tap on the Call settings icon.
 
3. Enable the “Lower ringtone while Announcing “ option. This will let you hear the calling person name clearly.
 
Note: You can also enable the Vibrate and silent mode if you want to hear the caller’s name when your phone is on silent or vibrate.
 
#### Important
 
People using Android Marshmallow and above need to make an extra setting in order to make the app to work.
 
Open phone Settings > Accessibility and turn on the option for “Caller Name Talker” app.
 
Now you can check, your Android phone will speak the caller name whenever you will get the call from someone.
 
#### SMS Sender Announcement
 
You can also enable the phone to speak SMS sender’s name using the Caller Name Talker app.
 
1. Launch the app and tap on the SMS settings icon on the app.
 
2. Then enable the “Announce SMS sender name” option.
 
3.  Now, you’ll have to grant “Read Notification” permission to the app. To do that, click on “Allow.” (Note: If you didn’t see this message, then it is possible that the app in your phone already has the notification access.)
 
4. After getting to the notification access of your phone, check on the “Caller Name Talker.”

### App 2: Who’s Calling?
 
If the previous app didn’t work well for you for any reason, then we do have an alternative for you.
 
Who’s Calling is yet another app that will make your phone announce the Caller name. Not only that, but it can also speak aloud the name of the person who is trying to connect with you on WhatsApp. And the amazing thing about this app is that it takes very less of your phone’s internal memory, as it is even less than 3MB in size.
 
Now, this app comes in 2 versions, first is the Light version, which is completely free while the second is the paid version. In the light version, you can use the announce feature for calling, or for any other app like WhatsApp. But do note that you can’t use both of them simultaneously, which basically means you’ll have to turn off calling before using announcement for WhatsApp.
 
However, in the PRO version, the announce feature can be used for an unlimited number of apps like LinkedIn, Facebook Messenger, or Skype. Also, it is important for you to know that SMS announcement won’t work in this app due to Google’s regulations.
 
To make this app work on your Android phone, just follow these simple steps.
 
1. Install Who’s Calling? Android app on your smartphone.
 
2. Launch the app, and turn on the Phone option.
 
Note: If the app is still not working, then go to your phone settings > Accessibility and turn on Who’s Calling.
