Unleash The Ultimate Secret To Setting Up Hamachi In Ubuntu - The Ultimate Guide Inside!

Hamachi, the virtual private network (VPN) service, is a popular application used by many Ubuntu users for creating secure connections between multiple computers. However, the process of setting it up can be a bit tricky, especially for beginners. In this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know to get started with Hamachi in Ubuntu.

Step 1: Install Hamachi

To install Hamachi in Ubuntu, you need to first add the LogMeIn repositories to your system. This will give you access to the latest version of Hamachi.

To add the LogMeIn repositories, open the terminal and enter the following command:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:logmein-hamachi/stable
```

After entering this command, Ubuntu will prompt you to confirm the addition of the repository. Accept the prompt and wait for the process to complete.

Next, update the package list:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

Finally, install Hamachi using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install hamachi
```

Step 2: Configure Hamachi

After installing Hamachi, you’ll need to configure it using the following steps:

1. Open the terminal and enter the following command to initiate the Hamachi configuration process:

   ```
   sudo hamachi-init
   ```

2. Once the configuration process has started, you'll be prompted to enter a nickname for your Hamachi account. Choose a nickname that is easy to remember and unique.

3. Next, you'll be prompted to enter an email ID associated with your Hamachi account. Enter a valid email ID and proceed to the next step.

4. During the next step of the configuration process, you'll be prompted to enter a password for your Hamachi account. Choose a strong password that you can remember easily.

5. Finally, you'll be asked to provide a network password. This is the password that you'll use to connect to other Hamachi users. Choose a strong network password to ensure maximum security.

Step 3: Join a Hamachi network

Once you’ve configured Hamachi, you can join a Hamachi network using the following steps:

1. Open the terminal and enter the following command:

   ```
   sudo hamachi join <network ID>
   ```

   Note: Replace <network ID> with the ID of the network you want to join.

2. Enter the network password when prompted.

3. Once you’ve successfully joined the network, you can connect with other users on the network.

Step 4: Create a Hamachi network

If you want to create your own Hamachi network, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal and enter the following command:

   ```
   sudo hamachi create <network name>
   ```

   Note: Replace <network name> with the name of your network.

2. Enter a strong network password when prompted.

3. Once you’ve created the network, share the network ID and password with other users to allow them to join the network.

Conclusion

Setting up Hamachi in Ubuntu may seem daunting at first, but with the right guidance, it can be done quickly and easily. By following this guide, you can unleash the ultimate secret to setting up Hamachi in Ubuntu and enjoy secure, fast connections with other users. So what are you waiting for? Get started today!

LogMeIn Hamachi is a zero-configuration Virtual Private Network (VPN) that works with your existing firewall and allows you to access your computer no matter where you are, as long as there is an Internet connection.
 
While there is a nice interface for the Windows version, Linux users can only access Hamachi via the command line interface. Nevertheless, with some help from the open-source community, Linux users can now easily install, configure and use Hamachi. This tutorial demonstrates the process for Ubuntu.
 
Tip: if you can’t get the Ubuntu terminal to open to run commands, we have a few fixes for you.
 
## How Hamachi Works
 
At its core, Hamachi is a proprietary VPN adapter that provides a virtual LAN through an overlay network.
 
Unlike traditional VPNs, such as NordVPN (see our NordVPN review for reference), Hamachi does not route any Internet traffic in and out of its servers. Instead, it allows you to create a secure, closed LAN between different computers, as Hamachi is useful in instances where you want to share a network service without exposing your host computer. For example, you can use it to start an SFTP server and share its contents only to a select few computers.
 
This Virtual LAN approach also allows you to use Hamachi for both peer-to-peer and local server gaming, making Hamachi invaluable for users who want to play games on Linux over the Internet without porting forward their connections.
 
## Installing Hamachi in Ubuntu
 
- Download Hamachi’s .deb package from the developer’s website with the following command. (The Hamachi client software does not exist in the Ubuntu Software Repository.)

 
- Install the Hamachi package through dpkg with the following command. Unlike apt, dpkg is a manual package manager for Debian and Ubuntu.

 
- Check whether you have properly installed Hamachi by running sudo hamachi help.

 
## Configuring Hamachi in Ubuntu
 
- Start setting up Hamachi on your Ubuntu machine. Configuring the program requires you to have a valid Hamachi account, which you can sign up for from the LogMeIn registration page.

 
- Once you have a valid account, you can use the Hamachi CLI to connect to the LogMeIn network:

 
- Create a new Hamachi network from the command line. For example, I am running the following command to create a new network using the name “MySecretNetwork1.”

 
- With a network up and running, use the Hamachi CLI to connect two machines – install Hamachi on a separate computer and use the join command:

 
Lastly, it is also possible to evict and delete an existing Hamachi network. For example, running the following commands will evict a peer using its Client ID and delete the network:
 
## Managing a Hamachi Network With the Haguichi GUI
 
Aside from directly using the terminal, it is possible to use Haguichi to create and manage a Hamachi network. This third-party GUI wraps around the Hamachi CLI client and presents its functions in a desktop window, which is useful if you are a new user and still not comfortable with the Bash command line.
 
To install the Haguichi GUI, follow the steps below.
 
- Add the Haguichi repository to your Ubuntu machine:

 
- Run the following commands to update your machine’s repository files and install the Haguichi GUI:

 
- Run the Haguichi GUI by pressing Win and typing “haguichi.”

 
- A window will open, asking you to configure your Hamachi client. Press the green “Configure” button to proceed.

 
- The Haguichi GUI will create an account for your machine and display information about the current Hamachi version on your system.

 
- Click the “+” button in the title bar of the Haguichi GUI to open the menu that allows you to join or create a network, then click “Create Network.”

 
- A small prompt will open, asking for the details of your new network. I am naming it “MySecretNetwork1” and providing a secure password.

 
- With Haguichi running, connect other machines to your new network by clicking the “+” button and selecting “Join Network.”

 
- You will see a small prompt where you can provide your network details. In my case, I will connect to “MySecretNetwork1.”

 
## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it possible to install Haguichi on non-Ubuntu systems?
 
Yes! While Haguichi is primarily available for Ubuntu and Debian systems, it is also possible to install this program on other Linux distributions. For example, you can run sudo dnf copr enable ztfen/hacuighi && sudo dnf install haguichi to install the program in Fedora.
 
Further, Haguichi is also available in Flathub as a distribution-independent package that you can install with: sudo flatpak install flathub com.github.ztefn.haguichi.
 
### I cannot include the Haguichi PPA in my system.
 
This most likely happens due to an issue between your Internet provider and your machine’s IPv6 address resolver. By default, the Ubuntu Launchpad PPA system uses IPv6 when adding and removing repositories, which means that Ubuntu will use IPv6, whether or not your network connection can support it.
 
This connection mismatch can be an issue if your current network provider does not support IPv6. To fix this, disable your system’s IPv6 support by running sysctl: sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1 to force Ubuntu to route every connection it makes to IPv4 instead.
 
### Is it possible to manage my Hamachi clients outside of my Ubuntu machine?
 
Yes! It is possible using the attach-net command along with your LogMeIn e-mail address: sudo hamachi attach-net ramces@email.invalid.
 
That will link every Hamachi network you created in your Ubuntu machine to your online LogMeIn account, allowing you to remotely manage these networks even if your Ubuntu machine is offline.
