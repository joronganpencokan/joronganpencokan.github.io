Title: Unlock the Power of Google Home: The Ultimate Guide to Making Calls Like a Pro!

Every day, Google Home becomes more than just a voice-activated assistant, it is truly a versatile device. It can help you in different ways, including making phone calls. With just a few clicks, Google Home can help you to contact someone you need or want to talk to. In this ultimate guide, we'll show you how to unlock the power of Google Home and master making calls like a pro.

What is Google Home?

Google Home is a smart speaker, powered by Google Assistant, that lets you control functions such as playing music, setting reminders or alarms, and making phone calls. Woven with artificial intelligence, the gadget can understand your commands and respond to your voice.

What do you need to set up making phone calls?

Before you start making phone calls with Google Home, you have to set up a few things:

1. Link your phone number: You need to link your phone number with Google Home, so that it can use it to make calls. To do that, go to the Google Home app, click on your device, and then go to settings. Under the device settings, search for "calls" and enter your phone number. Google Home will send a verification code to your phone number; enter the code to complete the setup process.

2. Link your contacts: Google Home needs to access your contacts to make phone calls. To link your contacts, go to the Google Home app, click on your device and then search for "linked accounts." Choose Google Contacts or any other phone book, to link your contacts.

3. You're good to go: Once you have followed the above two steps, you can start using Google Home to make phone calls.

How to make phone calls using Google Home?

1. Say "Hey Google" or "OK, Google" to activate the assistant, just like you would a phone call.

2. After the assistant has responded, say "Call" followed by the name of the person you want to call. Google Home will then try matching the speech to the contacts linked, and prompt you to confirm who you want to call. You can say the contact's full name or just their first name and Google Home will recognize it.

3. Once you've confirmed the contact, Google Home will initiate the call, using the linked phone number assigned to Google Home.

4. End a call: To end a call, say "Hey Google, hang up." Or gently put down the phone.

5. Make emergency calls: Google Home can't make emergency calls by itself. You will have to dial the local emergency phone number on your phone.

Tips for Making a Better Call with Google Home

1. Saying the full name of the contact is more effective than a nickname.

2. Speak clearly and face the Google Home gadget when making phone calls.

3. Ensure there's no music playing or background noise in your speakers.

4. If you want to put a call on mute, say "Hey Google, mute call."

5. To resume a call later, say "Hey Google, resume call."

Final remarks

Now that you've read this guide, making phone calls with Google Home should be a breeze. With just a few steps, you can link and enable Google to make phone calls for you, as well as end or mute the call if needed. As usual, ensure a quiet environment and speak clearly, and you'll have a successful phone call.
