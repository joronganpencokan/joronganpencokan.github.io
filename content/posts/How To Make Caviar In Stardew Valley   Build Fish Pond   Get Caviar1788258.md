Uncover the Secret to Making Riches in Stardew Valley: Learn How to Build a Fish Pond and Make Delicious Caviar!

If you're a fan of Stardew Valley, chances are you've spent a lot of time farming, collecting resources, and exploring the world of Pelican Town. But did you know that there's a hidden gem in the game that can help you make a fortune? That's right, we're talking about fish ponds and the delicious caviar they can produce.

In order to start building fish ponds, you'll need to have completed a few tasks first. Specifically, you'll need to have reached fishing level 3, completed the "River Fish Bundle" in the Community Center, and purchased the fish tank from Willy's shop. Once you've met these requirements, you can start building the fish pond.

To build a fish pond, head to the Carpenter's Shop and purchase the fish pond blueprint for 5,000 gold. You'll also need 200 stones and 5 seaweed to complete the construction. Once the pond is built, you can start stocking it with fish.

Different fish have different requirements when it comes to the size of the pond and the availability of certain resources. For example, sturgeon require a large pond and access to roe in order to produce caviar. However, if you can meet these requirements, you'll be able to start producing some seriously valuable products.

Once your fish have produced roe, you'll need to put it in a preserves jar to create caviar. Each jar of caviar sells for 500 gold, making it one of the most valuable items in the game. If you can manage to produce a lot of caviar, you'll be well on your way to a fortune.

But why stop at caviar? You can also use the fish you've raised to create other valuable products, such as fish tacos, sushi, and sashimi. By diversifying your products and using your fish in a variety of ways, you can make even more money.

Of course, all of this takes time and effort. You'll need to tend to your fish ponds regularly, making sure they have enough food and that the water quality is high. But if you're willing to put in the work, you can reap some serious rewards.

So why not give fish ponds a try? They're a fun and rewarding addition to Stardew Valley, and who knows, you just might strike it rich.

Caviar in Stardew Valley is an artisan good that isn’t really used in any quest. But many players prefer to get Caviar in order to use it in the spool of the Sewing machine to make the Fashion Hat. It also has a healing effect and fetches a nice selling price. In this guide, you can find out how to make Caviar in Stardew Valley.
 
## How to Get Caviar in Stardew Valley?
 
You will require a Fish Pond from the Carpenter’s Shop to make Caviar in Stardew Valley. This is what you will need for that:
 
- 5000g
 - 5 green algae
 - 200 stone
 - 5 seaweed

 

 
To get the green algae, you have to get to fresh water or saltwater. You can also slay green slimes for this purpose. And for seaweed, you have to look for saltwater specifically so the beach is your best bet. Also note that the fish pond will need 5×5 space so be prepared beforehand for it.
 
The fish in particular you have to look for is the Sturgeon which you can catch in Winter or Summer times. Head to the lake, catch the fish and put it in the fish pond you’ve made. If you’re lucky, you may catch the Sturgeon easily otherwise you will have to wait a bit.
 
Now that you have the pond and fish set up, you have to put the roe in the Preserve Jar. After 6000 in-game minutes, you will see that the Sturgeon roe has converted to Caviar so in real time, you have to wait for some days. Basically what happens is that when you put fish in the fish pond, they make roe which turns into aged roe when you use a Preserves Jar.
 
So, during the waiting period, take your time and complete your other tasks on the farm. Don’t forget to check on the pond daily to see any changes. When it is ready, you will see an exclamation mark over it. When you click on it, you will notice that the Sturgeon is requesting something. Give those things to it in the pond and wait some more. This is how you will get roe.
 
Once you have made it, you can sell Caviar for 500g per jar or even higher (700g) for Artisan Profession. It’s also a nice choice for a gift since it is an artisan good. If not, you can eat it yourself!
