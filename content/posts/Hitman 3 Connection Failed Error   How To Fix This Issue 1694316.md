# Are You Tired of Losing Connection in Hitman 3? Here's the Ultimate Fix!

If you are an avid Hitman 3 player who has experienced connectivity issues, you know how frustrating it can be. There is nothing worse than being in the middle of a mission, coordinated attack, or gun fight, only to lose connection to the server. Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to ensure your connection stays stable.

Here's the ultimate fix for the connectivity issues in Hitman 3:

## Ensure Your Connection is Stable

The first thing you need to do is ensure your connection is stable. It's important to understand that the stability of your connection is directly related to the quality of your internet service provider. Therefore, before you start playing, make sure your internet is working correctly, and your speed is not too slow for the game. Otherwise, you may experience disconnections frequently. To test your internet properly, use a speed test website like speedtest.net or similar.

## Disable Any Overlays

The next step to take is pruning all unwanted applications that might interfere with your gameplay. Your computer might be running multiple overlays that you do not need. While these overlays can be helpful for some things, they can cause many connectivity problems as well, especially in online games like Hitman 3. Therefore, you should double-check if any overlays are running in the background and disable them.

## Lower Graphics Settings in the Game

It's possible that the graphics settings in your game might be too high and demanding for your computer to handle. This can cause connectivity problems as well, particularly in online games, as it can put a significant strain on your connection. To fix this, try lowering the graphics settings in the game until the game runs smoothly.

## Use an Ethernet Cable

If you're playing Hitman 3 on a PC, it's recommended to use an ethernet cable instead of Wi-Fi. Although Wi-Fi technology has come a long way, it is still less reliable than an ethernet cable. Using a cable provides a stable and more reliable connection that is less susceptible to disconnections.

## Consider Uninstalling and Reinstalling the Game 

If nothing else works, give uninstalling and then reinstalling the game a chance. It might be necessary to remove the game entirely from your computer and download it again, as it is possible that the installation is corrupted or incomplete. This should only be attempted when there is nothing else that works.

To conclude, connectivity problems can be a hassle and take the fun out of online gaming. Still, fortunately, there are a few methods to fix them. By applying the tips above, you can ensure that your experience playing Hitman 3 is smooth and uninterrupted. So, go ahead and give these solutions a try – you may be pleasantly surprised by the results!
