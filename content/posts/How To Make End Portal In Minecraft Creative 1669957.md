As one of the most popular sandbox video games in the world, Minecraft has captured the hearts and imaginations of millions of players. With its vast open world, endless possibilities, and endless fun, Minecraft is a game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. 

One of the key features of Minecraft is the End, a mysterious and treacherous dimension that can only be accessed through an End Portal. If you're a Minecraft player who wants to unlock the secrets of the End and confront the fearsome Ender Dragon, then you need to know how to create an End Portal. 

Creating an End Portal in Minecraft Creative is actually quite easy once you know how. In this article, we'll show you step-by-step how to build the End Portal so you can take on one of the game's most exciting challenges. 

## Step 1: Gather the required materials 

Before you can begin building the End Portal, you need to ensure that you have all the necessary materials. Here's what you'll need: 

* 12 end portal frames 
* 12 Eyes of Ender 

To obtain end portal frames, you'll need to venture to a stronghold, a rare and difficult-to-find structure that spawns underground. Once you find one, you'll need to explore it and locate the end portal room – a square room containing a small pool of lava and a single end portal frame. You'll need to use the Eyes of Ender to activate this frame and reveal the End Portal. 

## Step 2: Place the end portal frames 

Once you have all 12 end portal frames, you can begin to construct the End Portal. Place the frames in a circle, with the inside of the circle remaining empty. This will create a circular structure consisting of 12 end portal frames. 

## Step 3: Activate the end portal 

Now that you've placed the end portal frames, you need to activate the End Portal. To do this, use the Eyes of Ender and place them inside the frames. As you do this, particle effects will appear and the End Portal will form. 

## Step 4: Enter the End 

With the End Portal now fully operational, you can jump in and explore the End! Once inside, you'll need to battle the Ender Dragon and explore the vast, alien landscape. The End is a challenging and unforgiving place, but with skill and determination, you can emerge victorious! 

## Conclusion 

Creating an End Portal in Minecraft Creative is a key step in unlocking the secrets of the End and taking on one of the game's toughest challenges. By gathering the required materials and following our step-by-step guide, you'll be able to construct an End Portal easily and quickly. So what are you waiting for? Get building and see what adventures await you in the End!

## How to Make an End Portal in Minecraft Creative?
 

 
In order to make an End Portal in Minecraft, you will need 12 Eyes of Ender as well as 12 End Portal Frames. Making an End Portal is only possible in Creative Mode as you cannot get End Portal Frames as a drop or as a treasure in Survival mode. The End Portal Frame is the only way to get to the End Dimension aside from the use of Commands. In Survival Mode, you would have to find the End Portal Frame by using an Eye of Ender. But in a Creative World or in Creative Mode, you can just build one and go. There is a Technique of making it as one wrong move and you will have to remake it. Here is how you can make an End Portal Frame in Minecraft, in Creative Mode.
 
### Steps to make the Portal Frame
 
- The End Portal is a 4×4 structure that does not have the corners filled.
 - So, make a 3×3 area as a frame of reference.
 - Now stand in the middle of the 3×3 area and look in any of the 4 directions.
 - From the Creative Menu, find End Portal Frames & put it in your Hotbar.
 - Place 3 of the End Portal Frames on the outside of the 3×3 area such that it makes a line perpendicular to you.
 - Now turn in the other direction and continue the process.
 - If you do this for all four directions, you should get an End Portal.
 - It will be a 4×4 & it will be missing the corners.
 - Be careful as there is only one correct way of placing them.
 - From the image, we can see that the End Portal Frames have different orientations based on the line that goes through the center of each piece.
 - If you are standing and looking in a direction, the End Portal Frames in front & at the back of you should have the lines in the vertical orientation.
 - The ones on your left & right should have the lines in the horizontal orientation.
 - Check the image above for more clarity.
 - Now all you have to do is place the Eyes of Ender in each of the End Portal Frames and the Portal will get activated.

 
With the activated End Portal, you will be able to go into the End. Once you beat the Ender Dragon, you will be able to use it as a Travel point to the End Dimension.
