#Unlock the Ultimate Secret in Hitman 3's Berlin Level - How to Find the Elusive Fuse Cell for the Crane Trauma Challenge!

Hitman 3 is a game that's all about stealth and strategy, and the Berlin level is no exception. One of the major challenges in Berlin is the Crane Trauma Challenge, which requires players to find a fuse cell and use it to repair a crane. In this article, we'll explore how to find this elusive fuse cell, so you can complete the challenge and unlock a new level of enjoyment from Hitman 3.

##The Challenge

The Crane Trauma Challenge in Berlin tasks the player with repairing a crane that's been damaged during an attack on the ICA facility. To complete the challenge, you must find a fuse cell and insert it into a broken power box to power up the crane, which will then move a wounded operative to safety.

The problem is that the fuse cell is not easy to find, and there are multiple locations where it could be hiding. In fact, discovering the fuse cell is one of the more challenging parts of the Berlin level, and it requires you to be thorough in your exploration and observation.

##The Solution

To find the fuse cell, you must explore the entire facility, searching for any objects or areas that seem out of place or unusual. Here are a few of the places where you might find the fuse cell:

1. Locker Room - Check the lockers in the locker room for any items that might help you complete the challenge. Be sure to search every locker to increase your chances of finding the fuse cell.

2. Break Room - The break room is another area to check for the fuse cell. Look for any containers or objects that could contain the cell, and be sure to search both the top and bottom shelves.

3. Storage Area - The storage area is a large room with lots of containers and crates. Check each one for the fuse cell, and be careful not to miss any hidden areas.

4. Rooftop - The rooftop has a small shed that you can enter. Look for any objects or containers that could contain the fuse cell.

5. Cargo Bay - The cargo bay is another room with lots of crates and containers. Look for any hidden areas and search every container.

6. Fuel Tanks - Finally, check the fuel tanks near the helicopter for the fuse cell. This location is often overlooked, but it's a potential hiding spot for the cell.

##Conclusion

Finding the fuse cell for the Crane Trauma Challenge in Hitman 3's Berlin level is not an easy task, but it's a challenge that's worth taking on. By exploring every area of the facility and being thorough in your search, you can discover the elusive fuse cell and complete the challenge.
