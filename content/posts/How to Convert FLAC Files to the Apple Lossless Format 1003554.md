When it comes to enjoying music, audio quality is the foremost factor that plays a significant role in enhancing the overall experience. While FLAC files provide the best audio quality, they are not compatible with Apple devices, leaving Apple Lossless Format as the optimal choice for those seeking lossless audio playback.

If you are looking for ways to convert FLAC files to Apple Lossless Format, then you have come to the right place. In this article, we will be discussing the game-changing tricks to converting FLAC files to Apple Lossless Format like a pro.

But first, let's understand the difference between FLAC and Apple Lossless Format.

FLAC, short for Free Lossless Audio Codec, is an audio format that offers the highest audio quality with no loss of data. FLAC files take up more storage space than other audio formats but provide an unmatched listening experience.

On the other hand, Apple Lossless (ALAC) is a codec that was developed by Apple that provides lossless compression of digital audio. ALAC offers the same sound quality as FLAC but is compatible with all Apple devices.

Now, let's discuss how to convert FLAC to Apple Lossless Format:

Step 1: Download a Converter Software

There are several converter software options available online that allow you to convert FLAC to ALAC format. Some of the most popular software include Switch Audio Converter and XLD.

Step 2: Install the Application

After downloading a converter software, you need to install it on your computer. Follow the installation instructions provided by the software to install it on your device.

Step 3: Select the FLAC file 

With the converter software installed, select the FLAC file that you want to convert to ALAC. Click on the locate file button and select the FLAC file from your hard drive.

Step 4: Select the File Format 

Select the Apple Lossless Format as your output format. This will ensure that your file is converted to an ALAC file that can be played on all Apple devices.

Step 5: Convert the File 

Now that you have selected the output format, click on convert or start button to initiate the conversion process.

Step 6: Check Your Converted File

Once the conversion process is completed, check your converted file to ensure that it is in the correct format. You can also listen to the song to check if the sound quality has been maintained.

In conclusion, converting FLAC files to Apple Lossless Format is an easy process that can be done with the right converter software. By following the above-mentioned steps, you can enjoy lossless audio playback on all Apple devices. So, unlock the ultimate sound quality by converting your FLAC files to Apple Lossless Format like a pro!

If you take your music seriously, you might already be on board the lossless audio train. If you aren’t, it might be worth a look. Unlike lossy formats like MP3, lossless formats give you the same exact audio you would get from a CD. Sometimes, if you’re buying from a hi-res store like HDtracks, the quality is even better.
 
Whether you’ve ripped your own collection of CDs or bought music from a hi-res store, you might end up with files in the FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) format. FLAC works on Mac with players like Vox or VLC, but not if you want to use iTunes. Fortunately, converting those files to ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) is easy, and you won’t sacrifice any quality.
 
## Install XLD
 
There are a few ways to convert FLAC to ALAC on a Mac, but XLD is one of the simplest. First, you’ll need to download the app from Sourceforge. Double click the installed file, then drag the XLD icon into your Applications folder. Now you can launch the app, either by searching for it via Spotlight or by double-clicking the icon.
 
## Configure XLD
 
XLD simply sits in your dock, so to configure it you’ll need to click the icon in the dock to make sure it’s selected, select XLD from the menu bar, and then select Preferences.
 

 
By default, XLD doesn’t come set to encode to ALAC. In the preferences menu go to the “Output Format” drop-down menu at the top of the General tab and select “Apple Lossless.” While you’re here, you’ll also want to set up your output directory.
 
While there are a lot of other options, you can safely leave them alone.
 
## Adding your converted files to iTunes
 
If you’re converting your FLAC files to ALAC, it’s likely because you want to import them into your iTunes library. You can do that while you convert them, saving yourself a step later. There are just a few extra options to set up.
 
XLD has an “Add encoded files to iTunes if possible” option, which may work fine for you, but there’s another way. Simply set your output directory to your “Automatically Add to iTunes” directory. Usually this will be located in “/Users/yourname/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/.”
 
There’s one extra precaution to take here. Make sure to select the “Use temporary folder, then move to the destination” option. Otherwise, larger files may not be properly added to iTunes.
 
## Convert your files
 
Once you’ve got everything configured, you can start converting your files. If you’re in a hurry or want to take a hands-off approach, there’s one more option you can set. In Preferences click on the Batch tab, and select “Preserve directory structures.” With this enabled, you can theoretically drag and drop your entire FLAC collection onto the XLD icon and wait while it does the rest.
 
If you’d rather be more careful with your music collection, you can take a slower approach. You can drag individual songs, but we’ve successfully tested more than that. Dragging and dropping multiple folders of albums of songs works just fine.
 
You can also go to the File menu and open Folders or even Audio CDs to rip and encode. Once you have selected your files, XLD will start the conversion process. The app is fast on most computers and will convert multiple songs at a time.
 
For the first few songs or albums, you’ll want to check the converted files. As long as everything is properly named and works as intended, you can proceed with converting the rest of your collection.
