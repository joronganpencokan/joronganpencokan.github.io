### When Do Teams Make a Difference?
 
When it comes to joining a gym, teams are important. A player who is a member of Team Valor cannot join a gym owned by team Mystic. If you wish to join a gym, you’ll have to fight for turf and kick the other team out, but none of them have an open spot and are controlled by the same team as you. A few more pros of having a team are listed below.
 
- You can only battle a gym if it is not already under your team’s control.
 - Teams are only important if you own a gym, but since gyms are where you train your Pokemon, they might be really important. You may claim the site for your squad if you take it on and win.

 
If you want to join a gym straight away but don’t care about the team you join, glance at the color of the gym.
 
- Yellow color is for Team Instinct
 - Blue color is for Team Mystic
 - Red Color is for Team Valor

 
You can pick a team in Pokemon Go and join the gym squad whenever a spot becomes available.
