Revolutionize your communication game: Learn the secret method to make phone calls with your Homepod!

The Homepod is more than just a speaker, it's a game-changer in the world of communication. Yes, it's possible to make phone calls with your Homepod! With this secret method, you can use your Homepod to make and receive calls seamlessly. 

The first step to making phone calls with your Homepod is to ensure that it's updated to the latest software. You can do this via the Home app on your iOS device. Once updated, you need to ensure that your Homepod is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your iOS device. 

To make a phone call, simply say "Hey Siri, call (contact name or phone number)". Your Homepod will then initiate the call, and you can have a hands-free conversation without needing to hold your phone. 

But what makes using the Homepod for phone calls so great? Well, for starters, it's much more convenient than constantly holding your phone up to your ear. With the Homepod, you can go about your day-to-day activities while chatting with your friends and family. 

Furthermore, the Homepod's powerful speakers deliver excellent sound quality, which means that you'll be able to hear the person you're talking to clearly, even if you're not in a quiet room. 

Another benefit of using the Homepod for phone calls is that it's compatible with FaceTime Audio, which means that you can make FaceTime calls using your Homepod as well. This is especially useful if you're in a group setting and want to have a conversation with multiple people. 

But what if you receive a call while using your Homepod? The process is just as easy. Simply say "Hey Siri, answer the call" or "Hey Siri, decline the call" to respond to the incoming call hands-free. 

In a world where communication is key, the Homepod provides a new level of convenience, making phone calls simpler and more seamless. Once you've given it a try, it's hard to imagine going back to the old method of holding a phone up to your ear. 

So, if you want to revolutionize your communication game, give the secret method of making phone calls with your Homepod a try. It's a game-changer!

##   How to Make Phone Calls With Your HomePod  
 

To use your HomePod as a speakerphone to make calls with your iPhone, follow these steps:

 
- Make a call as you normally would on your iPhone (by dialing a number, tapping a contact, etc.)
 - Once the call has started, tap the Audio button.
 - In the menu that pops up from the bottom of the screen, tap the name of your HomePod.
 - When the call is switched to the HomePod, an icon of the HomePod will appear in the Audio button and you'll hear the call audio coming from the HomePod.
 - Because you can't use Siri to place calls, you also can't use it to end the call either. Instead, you can either tap the red phone icon on the iPhone's screen or tap the top of the HomePod.

 
##   Dealing With Call Waiting and Multiple Calls When Using HomePod as a Speakerphone  
 

If a new call comes into your iPhone while you're using the HomePod as a speakerphone, you have a few options:

 

Make a call as you normally would on your iPhone (by dialing a number, tapping a contact, etc.)

 

Once the call has started, tap the Audio button.

 

In the menu that pops up from the bottom of the screen, tap the name of your HomePod.

 

When the call is switched to the HomePod, an icon of the HomePod will appear in the Audio button and you'll hear the call audio coming from the HomePod.

 

Because you can't use Siri to place calls, you also can't use it to end the call either. Instead, you can either tap the red phone icon on the iPhone's screen or tap the top of the HomePod.

 
- End the current call and switch to the new one: Touch and hold on the green light on top of the HomePod.Answer the new call and put the current call on hold: Tap the green light on top of the HomePod.Switch between calls: Tap the top of the HomePod.

 
##   A Limit of the HomePod: Speakerphone Only  
 

When it comes to using the HomePod for phone calls, there's one major, annoying limitation: you can't actually place phone calls on the HomePod. Unlike for text messages, which you can read and send on the HomePod just by speaking to Siri, you can't start a phone call via Siri. So, there's no option to just say "Hey Siri, call mom" and start speaking to your mother.

 

Instead, you must start a phone call on your iPhone and then switch the audio output to the HomePod. When you do this, you'll hear the phone call coming from the HomePod and will be able to talk to it like any other speakerphone.

 

Given that other smart speakers allow you to place calls by voice, this is a frustrating limitation. Here's hoping Apple eventually adds a calling feature to the HomePod.

 
##   Apps That Can Use HomePod as a Speakerphone  
 

The HomePod works as a speakerphone with a number of calling apps besides the Phone app built into iOS. The phone apps that can use the HomePod for calls include:

 
- FaceTime
 - Phone
 - Skype
 - Viber
 - WhatsApp.
