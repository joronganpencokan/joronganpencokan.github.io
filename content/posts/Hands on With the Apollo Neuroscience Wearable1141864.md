# Revolutionize your life with the Apollo Neuroscience wearable - see what happened when we tried it out!

Are you tired of feeling stressed, anxious, or exhausted? Have you tried a variety of methods to improve your mood and energy levels, but nothing seems to work? If so, you may want to try the Apollo Neuroscience wearable, a new device that promises to revolutionize your life by helping you manage stress and improve your mental health.

We recently tried the Apollo Neuroscience wearable, and we were blown away by its impact on our daily lives. Here's what happened when we put it to the test:

## What is the Apollo Neuroscience wearable?

Before we share our experience with the device, let's take a closer look at what it is and how it works.

The Apollo Neuroscience wearable is a small, sleek device that you wear on your ankle or wrist. It uses gentle vibrations to stimulate your nervous system in a way that promotes relaxation, focus, and calm. The device was developed based on research that shows how certain types of vibrations can activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for calming the body and reducing stress.

The wearable comes with a companion app that allows you to choose from various vibration patterns, each designed to promote a different mental state. For example, "Energy and Wake Up" mode uses high-frequency vibrations to promote alertness and focus, while "Relax and Unwind" mode uses low-frequency vibrations to calm the body and mind.

## Our experience with the device

We were eager to try out the Apollo Neuroscience wearable and see if it lived up to its promise. Here's what we found:

### Day 1: Setting up the device

Setting up the Apollo Neuroscience wearable was quick and easy. We downloaded the app, connected the device to our smartphone via Bluetooth, and selected the vibration pattern we wanted to try. We started with "Relax and Unwind" mode, as we were feeling a bit stressed after a long day.

At first, we didn't notice much of a difference, but after a few minutes, we felt a subtle sense of calmness and relaxation. It was a pleasant sensation, and we looked forward to seeing what other modes the device had to offer.

### Day 2: Trying out different modes

On the second day, we tried out the "Energy and Wake Up" mode in the morning, and it was a game-changer. The high-frequency vibrations gave us an immediate burst of energy and helped us focus on our work. We felt more alert and productive throughout the day, and we were amazed at how effective the device was.

Later in the day, we tried out "Meditate and Mindfulness" mode, which uses a combination of high- and low-frequency vibrations to promote a deep sense of relaxation. We used it during a short meditation session, and it helped us quiet our minds and reduce our racing thoughts.

### Day 3: Incorporating the device into our daily routine

By the third day, we were hooked on the Apollo Neuroscience wearable. We started wearing it regularly throughout the day, switching between different modes depending on our needs. We used it to energize ourselves in the morning, focus on work during the day, and unwind before bed.

We noticed significant improvements in our overall mood and energy levels. We felt less stressed, more focused, and more present in the moment. The device helped us stay grounded and centered, even during hectic and stressful days.

## Final thoughts

The Apollo Neuroscience wearable is a truly revolutionary device that has the potential to change the way we manage stress and improve our mental health. It's easy to use, effective, and incredibly versatile. We highly recommend it to anyone who wants to feel more relaxed, focused, and energized.

So if you're looking for a way to revolutionize your life and take control of your mental health, give the Apollo Neuroscience wearable a try. You won't be disappointed!

The week I spent test-driving an Apollo Neuroscience wearable was unusually productive, but I've still got my doubts.

Key Takeaways
 
- The Apollo wearable purports to help with anxiety and stress by emitting low-frequency sound waves.It's nicely unobtrusive when worn, although the straps are a pain to change out.They showed the data, but I’m still wary of the placebo effect.

 

The Apollo, built in accordance with a University of Pittsburgh study, is an app-controlled wearable ($349, or $32/month) that purports to regulate your mood with the calming effects of inaudible sound waves. Depending on the setting, it's supposed to help with relaxation, focus, anxiety, stress, or sleep.

 

Ordinarily, I'd pass something like this by, but after the top-rope soul crusher that was 2020, I've gotten more proactively interested in practices like chill-out apps and other at-home mental health boosters. I ordered an Apollo and went through my weekly routine with a faintly buzzing not-watch strapped to my wrist or ankle, just to see how it turned out, but after eight days, I’m still not really sure how much good it did.

 
##   No, It's Not an Ankle Monitor  
 

Out of the box, the Apollo is a small curved plastic gadget that could be mistaken for a wristwatch, or a sleep-mode smartwatch, at a distance. It charges through a USB Micro-B cord that fits into its underside—so you can't charge it and wear it at the same time—and comes with two Velcro straps that fit it to your wrist or ankle.

 
It sounds like snake oil at first, but Apollo's designers at least know what a double-blind study is and have pursued several.
 

The science behind the Apollo, according to its designers, is that inaudible sound waves can "safely and reliably change how we feel through our sense of touch."

 

It sounds like snake oil at first, but Apollo's designers at least know what a double-blind study is and have pursued several. By tapping into your sense of touch via vibrational sound, it’s meant to, and seemingly does, affect your mood.

 

You activate the Apollo via Bluetooth with its mobile app, which lets you choose one of seven themed settings for set periods and control the sound waves’ intensity.

 

The recommendation is to start around 30% with each mode to see how that works for you, but even at 100%, most of the modes are subtle.

 

The exception is "Energy and Wake-Up." The other modes are gentle pulses, but "Energy" is a dissonant thrumming that’s harder to tune out.

 

You do get used to every mode on the Apollo very quickly. After about 10 minutes with "Clear and Focused" mode at 55%, I found myself reaching down to make sure the Apollo was still on. It's surprisingly unobtrusive for something that's supposed to be affecting your mood.

 
##   Seven Days Later  
 

The basic user experience with Apollo makes it clear that this is still a first-gen product. On Android, the companion app loses its connection to the Apollo whenever your mobile device goes to sleep, which occasionally forced me to reboot the app. It’s also a lot harder than it should be to swap out the straps.

 

Even so, I stuck with the Apollo for the week, alternating between wearing it on my wrist and ankle, and used the various modes per the recommended starting routine. It’s recommended to set it for energy and focus early in the day, then cycle down at night with the social and relaxation settings.

 

In general, it seemed like it worked. I've gotten a lot of mileage out of using the Apollo to keep me on task, using it to augment and assist whatever I planned to be doing at the time.

 

The one exception was the "Sleep and Renew" setting, which was a near-total misfire. Even at a low setting, Apollo's vibration made it, if anything, harder for me to sleep.

 

The other six settings do feel like they've had at least some positive effect, though. I got a lot done this week, even with a new gadget buzzing on my arm, and it's helped me draw a firmer line between work and leisure.

 

My primary issue is that I'm not sure how much of Apollo's effects are something I can credit to the device. Am I actually tweaking my own brain, or am I just using it as a way to better organize my hour-to-hour schedule? If it's the latter, could I have saved a few hundred bucks and set up a personal system of colored slap bracelets?

 
It's surprisingly unobtrusive for something that's supposed to be affecting your mood.
 

I'm cynical, but I'm also discussing something hard to measure. The Apollo is at least a more interesting and fact-based alternative to the host of wellness products that saturate the market, and I'd say it's tentatively worth a look.
