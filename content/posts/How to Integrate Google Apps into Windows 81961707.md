# Learn the Genius Hack to Seamlessly Integrate Google Apps with Windows 8!

Are you a Google Apps power user who recently upgraded to Windows 8? If so, you've probably noticed that getting the two to play nicely together can be a bit of a challenge. But fear not! With this genius hack, you'll be able to seamlessly integrate your favorite Google Apps with Windows 8 in no time.

Before we dive into the hack itself, it's worth taking a moment to understand why integrating Google Apps with Windows 8 can be such a pain. The key issue is that Windows 8 was designed with Microsoft's own Office suite in mind, meaning that it doesn't always play well with other productivity apps - including those from Google.

But with this hack, we're going to bypass those issues and get your Google Apps humming along happily in no time. Here's what you need to do:

1. Install the Google Chrome browser. This step is key, as we'll be using Chrome to create a direct link between Windows 8 and Google Apps. You can download Chrome from the Google website.

2. Next, navigate to the Google Apps you'd like to integrate with Windows 8. For example, if you want to use Google Drive, go ahead and load up the Google Drive website.

3. Once you're on the Google Apps page, click the three dots in the upper-right corner of the Chrome window. This will open up the Chrome menu. From there, select "More tools" and then "Create shortcut."

4. In the window that pops up, give your new shortcut a name (e.g. "Google Drive") and make sure that the "Open as window" checkbox is selected. This is important, as it will allow you to use the Google App as if it were a separate program on your desktop.

5. Finally, click "Create" to generate the shortcut. This will create a new icon on your desktop that, when clicked, will open up the Google App in its own window - just like any other program.

And that's it! With your shiny new Google App shortcut, you'll be able to seamlessly integrate your favorite Google productivity tools with Windows 8. You'll no longer have to worry about clunky workarounds or awkward compatibility issues - just click the icon and get to work!

In conclusion, if you're a Google Apps power user who's struggling to get Windows 8 to play nicely with your favorite productivity tools, this hack is definitely worth a try. By creating direct shortcuts to your Google Apps, you'll be able to bypass compatibility issues and get the best of both worlds - the slick interface of Windows 8, coupled with the powerful productivity tools of Google. Give it a shot today!

Google and Microsoft often go at each other’s throats when it comes to the latest and greatest in online technologies. It should come as no surprise then to see that Google products are not integrated into the Windows 8 release. There are a few ways to integrate Google apps into Windows 8. While they may not give the functionality you would like, it can be a quick fix.
 
## Why integrate Google apps into Windows 8?
 
Google has become part of our lives now online. For many of us, we would be lost without access to Google Search, Gmail, Maps and more. By integrating these apps into Windows 8, we can have instant access to everything we do with our Google accounts without having to open the browser.

3. Click “Relaunch Chrome in Windows 8 mode.”
 
Chrome will then relaunch itself and when it does, you will be using a full screen app-like version of it. While it may not be a true Windows 8 app version of Chrome, its appearance will blend in with the feel of your operating system.
 
## Move Gmail to Windows 8 mail
 
Windows 8 comes with a pre-installed version of its mail app. You can add a variety of accounts to it, including your Gmail account.
 
1. Open “Mail” from the Start screen.

If you use any other Google app frequently, you can create a live tile shortcut on your Start screen to access it instantly.
 
1. Open Google Chrome and head to the Google app of your choice.  For this guide, we will be using Google Drive.
 
2. Click the settings button in the browser, followed by “Tools.”
 
3. Click “Create application shortcuts….”
 
4. A pop-up will ask you where you want to create the shortcut. Choose “Desktop,” then click “Create.”

5. Now, head back to your Start screen and you will see the newly created Google app shortcut. Click on it.
 
You now have access to that Google app in Windows 8 in its own compact window.
