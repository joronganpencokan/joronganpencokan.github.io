# Revolutionize Your Linux Game: Learn How to Keep Your System Running Smoothly with Netdata!

As a Linux user, you know the importance of keeping your system running smoothly. A well-maintained system can help you get the most out of your Linux experience, while a poorly maintained one can lead to a frustrating and unnecessary bumpy ride. Luckily, Netdata is here to revolutionize your Linux game and make system maintenance easy and efficient.

Netdata is an open-source, real-time monitoring tool that provides users with an unobstructed view of what's happening on their system. With Netdata, you can monitor every aspect of your system's performance, from CPU usage to memory consumption, network throughput, and more. Furthermore, Netdata is incredibly easy to use and offers a robust set of features that make it an indispensable tool for Linux users.

Here are four ways Netdata can revolutionize your Linux game:

## 1. Real-time monitoring

One of the most significant advantages of Netdata is that it provides real-time monitoring. This means you can see what's happening on your system precisely at the moment it happens. You don't have to wait for log files to be written, or for a tool to process them—you can see everything as it happens.

Real-time monitoring is crucial because it enables you to react quickly to issues that arise. For example, if you notice that your server's CPU usage suddenly spikes, you can take immediate action to address the issue.

## 2. Comprehensive metrics

Netdata is designed to provide users with comprehensive and detailed metrics. This means you can see a lot of information about your system's performance, including CPU usage, memory utilization, disk I/O, and network throughput, among others.

The extensive metrics that Netdata provides are beneficial because they provide a complete overview of your system's performance. You can use these metrics to identify trends and patterns and make informed decisions about how to optimize your system's performance.

## 3. Interactive and customizable dashboards

With Netdata, you don't just get access to comprehensive metrics—you also get interactive and customizable dashboards. This means you can tailor your dashboard to show precisely the information you want to see.

The interactive and customizable dashboards offered by Netdata are useful because they enable you to focus on the most critical aspects of your system's performance. You can create dashboards that show CPU and memory usage for specific processes, network throughput for specific network interfaces, and so on.

## 4. Simple installation and setup

Finally, one of the biggest advantages of Netdata is how easy it is to install and set up. You can install Netdata on most Linux distributions with just a few simple commands.

Once installed, Netdata will automatically gather performance data from your system and present it to you in an organized and easy-to-understand way. You don't have to configure anything to start using Netdata—you can start monitoring your system's performance with just a few clicks.

In conclusion, if you're a Linux user, Netdata is an indispensable tool that can help you keep your system running smoothly. With its real-time monitoring, comprehensive metrics, interactive and customizable dashboards, and simple installation and setup, Netdata will revolutionize your Linux game and make system maintenance easy and efficient.

Netdata is a tool used for health monitoring and distributed real time performance of machines. It gives insights on anything that happens to a system through web dashboards.
 
Apart from its major function, Netdata has a number of advantages. It is very lightweight, meaning that it uses little CPU cycles and memory. Netdata comes with a responsive web interface which does not require any flash plugin to show the data. It shows data in well-displayed charts and graphs and a non-cluttered display, with the most important shown first.
 
## Features of Netdata
 
- Uses a responsive bootstrap dashboard
 - It is light and very fast, hence using fewer resources
 - Little to no configuration is required to get started
 - It is able to monitor the whole system

 
In this article we are going to learn how to install Netdata on a Linux system and will show examples. Like I said before, it is very light and does not need any special hardware or software requirements to get it running.
 
Note: this article was written with a Ubuntu machine. Most of the commands will work, regardless of the distro you are using.
 
## Installation
 
To get started, you can choose to install either a basic or advanced version of Netdata. A basic installation includes system monitoring without other applications such as a database, SNMP and hardware sensors, while the advanced installation has all these other applications.
 
Run the following command for a basic Netdata installation:
 
For the advanced Netdata installation, run this command:
 
In my case I am installing the advanced version of Netdata. Running either of the commands above detects the specifications of your operating system, and you get an output similar to the following image.
 

 
After getting the output above, you can then press Enter to install all the dependencies. You will then get a message that asks you to proceed to the next step, as shown below.
 
You can now download Netdata by running the command below and make netdata the active directory after it is done downloading:
 
To build the software and have it installed, run the following command:
 
You will now see the following output.
 
Press Enter to continue with the installation. At this step the installer will be compiling the source and installing it, and you will be able to get the following output if you were successful.
 
Netdata daemon configurations are now held at “/etc/netdata/netdata.conf” which was created for you.
 
## Configuration and Usage
 
To start netdata, you can run this command:
 
And this command stops it:
 
Netdata shows you the above commands on a successful install. It also shows you the link to use if you want to access the charts and graphs it creates. In my case the following image is what it shows.
 
If you visit the link, you will see the following image.
 
You can set Netdata to start automatically on system boot by running the following commands:
 
The configuration file can be edited using a text editor of your choice. The configuration file has all the lines commented or is empty. This means that Netdata only uses default values. If you would like to change anything, uncomment the line and change it from the default value. Some default values that can be changed include:
 
- Stored data. Netdata stores only data from the past hour. Change this from “history = 3600” to “history = (your choice).”
 - Update interval. Netdata takes a second to refresh the charts and graphs in displays. To change this, change update every = 1 to your choice.
 - Port. Netdata uses port 19999. You can change this port to any other one that you want.

 
If there is a newer version of Netdata released that you would like to update to, you can use the command below which gets the new version and updates Netdata:
 
Running these commands uninstalls Netdata:
 
## Conclusion
 
Netdata is a very useful tool. In a situation where you are running a system that is too slow or a server that is not working to your expectations, use Netdata to monitor their performance and find out what could be wrong. It allows you to monitor the CPU, memory, disks, network interfaces, IPV4 and IPV6 networking, interprocess communication, Netfilter, and processes among other items, therefore giving you the ability to understand your machine and configure it accordingly.
