The cakes are known for their moist, yet firm texture, which makes them easy to cut and serve to guests. However, the magic doesn't stop there. 

The real secret is in the decoration of the cake. The pastry chefs at Dreamlight Valley use a technique known as fondant to make their cakes stand out.

The process involves creating a smooth surface with the fondant and then adding intricate details like flowers, patterns, or even personalized messages. The result is a wedding cake that looks like it just stepped out of a fairytale. 

One of the advantages of using fondant to decorate your cake is that it's relatively easy to work with. The chefs at Dreamlight Valley use this technique to create the most awe-inspiring designs, and you can easily recreate them at home. All you need is a bit of patience and a steady hand. You can find ready-made fondant at any cake supply store, or you can make it yourself. There are numerous tutorials available online that show you how to make and work with fondant.

It's worth noting that although fancy decorations are a showstopper, it's essential to keep the flavors of the cake in mind. At Dreamlight Valley, the pastry chefs use high-quality ingredients like premium vanilla extract, top-notch butter, and the freshest fruits to create the cake's flavors. When planning your wedding cake, make sure to select ingredients that will result in a flavorful cake. Work with a reputable cake maker who understands the importance of flavor and quality.

In conclusion, if you're planning a wedding and want to have a cake that will leave lasting impressions, consider using the fondant technique. In Dreamlight Valley, the pastry chefs use this technique to create cakes that are nothing short of breathtaking. The secret is out and is no longer just for the theme park's visitors.
