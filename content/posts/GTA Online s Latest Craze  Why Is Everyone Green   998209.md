# GTA Online's Latest Craze Revealed: Discover the Shocking Reason Why Every Player is Turning Green!

If you play GTA Online, you might have noticed a strange trend in the game lately. Every player seems to be turning green! And it's not just a few players here and there; it's practically everyone. But why is this happening? What is the reason behind this latest craze in the game? 

The answer is surprisingly simple: it's all about money. In GTA Online, players can earn money by completing various tasks and missions. They can use this money to buy new gear, cars, and properties. But some players have found an easier way to earn money: by exploiting a glitch in the game that turns their character green. 

The glitch works like this: when a player completes the Pacific Standard Heist finale, their character will turn green. This glitch has been known for a while, but it wasn't until recently that players discovered how to use it to their advantage. 

Here's how it works: a player turns their character green by completing the Pacific Standard Heist finale, then they go to a clothing store and change their outfit. When they exit the store, their character will still be green. They can then go to one of the game's many car garages and sell a car. The glitch causes the game to think that the player is selling a green modified car, which is worth a lot of money. 

Players have been making millions of dollars using this glitch. They can repeat the process over and over again, earning more and more money each time. It's a quick and easy way to become rich in the game. 

But the glitch has a downside. It's considered cheating, and if you get caught, you could get banned from the game. Rockstar Games, the developer of GTA Online, has been cracking down on players who use exploits like this, so it's not worth the risk. 

So, that's why every player in GTA Online seems to be turning green. It's all about money. But it's important to remember that cheating in the game is not allowed. If you want to earn money legitimately, there are plenty of ways to do so. You can complete missions, races, and heists. You can also invest in stocks and properties, or participate in the game's various businesses. 

In conclusion, the latest craze in GTA Online might be tempting, but it's not worth the risk of getting banned from the game. It's important to play the game fairly and legitimately. Remember, the journey is just as important as the destination. Happy gaming!

Over the past few weeks, aliens on GTA online have gone lollygagging on the streets of Los Santos. Your regular joes faced the heat with pool cues, baseball bats, or being perforated with Mk2s and hydras by, what you would call, “green men” or “extraterrestrials”.
 
 
 
What you would mistakenly surmise as an alien invasion is, in fact, a hot new fetish of the GTA online gamers themselves. It all started with a bunch of ruffians dressed as green hooligans, bundled up in the back of a van, just spreading absolute chaos in the streets. Soon enough, this trend gained popularity, and players stripped the clothing centers clean off the green spandex suit, they call it the “Alien Suit”.
 
## Here’s how you can get your own alien suit, for just a mere $300,000.
 

 
Currently, GTA online is in a frenzy, as more and more players are dressing up as aliens and joining forces with like-minded pranksters to beat up regular passers-by. Here is how they roll:
 
They giddy-up in a van, drive to random locations, leap out, beat you to death, hop back in and drive into the abyss.
 
Sometimes they’ll call up Lester from their phone book and buy an “Off-The-Radar” trick for $500 to pay you a surprise visit.
 
They might hide outside casinos and wait for your return after a day of hard-earned money, only to strip you of your wallet.
 
One of the best moments of the game – A bunch of aliens was harassing people when a differently-dressed crew of aliens decided to show up and get in a mob fight.
 
Although, the “green-cladded” frenzy has exploded into existence right now, here is a bus of 15 aliens back in August, with one goal in mind – the destruction of peace.
 
To what level of annoyance this aliens buzz has created, you would come to adore this foolishness. Indeed, havocking other GTA Online players gameplay without provocation is a little disgraceful and wonderfully idiotic.  Let’s hope when players grow tired of aliens, some new foolishness catches on real soon. We all need some entertainment, don’t we?
