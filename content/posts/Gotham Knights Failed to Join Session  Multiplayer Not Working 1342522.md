# Unthinkable! Gotham Knights Multiplayer System Crashes - Gamers Left Joining Session!

Gaming enthusiasts worldwide were eagerly anticipating the release of the multi-player system for Gotham Knights, the latest game developed by Warner Bros. Games Montreal. However, the much-awaited launch of the multiplayer system has left gamers disappointed and frustrated as they struggle to join sessions.

The Gotham Knights' multiplayer system was launched on August 14, 2021, and within minutes of its release, gamers went on social media platforms to vent their frustration over the crashes and inability to join sessions.

The game's official Twitter account responded to the gamers' grievances by stating that the developers were aware of the system crashes and hard at work resolving the issue. However, several hours after the tweet, gamers were still struggling to join sessions, and the issue remained unresolved.

The Gotham Knights multiplayer mode represented a revolutionary departure from previous games in the Batman franchise. Players can choose to play as one of four different characters, Batman, Robin, Batgirl, or Nightwing. The gameplay is set in an open-world environment where players can fight crime and explore the city together.

Despite the game's undeniable potential, the latest setback has resulted in numerous gamers losing faith in Warner Bros. Games Montreal. Some users have expressed their disappointment and anger towards the game's developers for releasing a product that was not fully tested.

One Twitter user wrote, "I don't understand why so many game studios release games that are incomplete or not fully tested. It ruins the experience for everyone, and it's disappointing that they don't take the time to fix these issues before launch."

Another Twitter user posted, "I was so excited for the Gotham Knights' multiplayer system, but the system crashes have ruined the entire experience for me. I hope the developers can fix the issue soon."

As of now, there has been no official statement from the game's developers regarding when the session joining issue will be resolved. It is unclear whether the developers will need to issue a patch or release a full system update.

In conclusion, the Gotham Knights multiplayer system crashes have left gamers frustrated and disappointed. The incident brings to light the need for game developers to invest more in testing and quality control before releasing new products. With gamers demanding high-quality products, it is vital for developers to focus on delivering satisfactory gaming experiences to avoid future setbacks.

Gotham Knights can be played with a friend via the multiplayer co-op mode but this feature is not without its issues. When you try to join a friend, you may see the Failed to Join Session Matchmaking error, leading you to wonder why multiplayer is not working in Gotham Knights. If you can’t invite friends, here’s what you need to know about the issue.
 
## Gotham Knights Failed to Join Session (Multiplayer Not Working)
 

 
While there is no official fix or workaround from the developers for the Failed to Join Session error, it is most likely a launch-time issue that will eventually get patched up. It has been reported to the devs and an “Investigation in Progress” has been mentioned on the page. If you face any other multiplayer error and it’s not mentioned in the bug reports yet, you can report the same here. It seems that players can’t invite friends but they are able to play with randoms, so if you really want to explore the multiplayer mode, that is an option right now.
 
And if this issue appears in the future, there can be multiple reasons why it’s coming up. It could be your internet, game files, or the game’s server issues.
 
### Check your Internet Connection
 
If you are not able to join even random players via the matchmaking process, chances are that your internet connection has some problems. Reset your router and try to connect again. On PC, ensure that your antivirus software or firewall isn’t blocking your connection to the game server.
 
### Check if Gotham Knights Servers are Down
 
Another reason why multiplayer may not be working in Gotham Knights is that the servers are down. If that’s the case, there’s nothing much you can do until the servers are back up online. Keep checking threads online on Reddit, Discord, and other gaming forums to see if other players are also facing similar issues or not.
 
If it’s a bug that’s come up, you can close the game and start again to see if a fresh start fixes it. You can also verify your Steam game files to fix any corrupt files.
 
### Verify Steam Game Files
 
- Start Steam.
 - Find the game in your library.
 - Right-click on the game and click on Properties.
 - Find the Local Files tab.
 - Click on Verify Integrity of Game Files.
 - After the process is done, reload the game.
