## How to Convert CSGO Sens to Valorant [2022]
 

 
You must have heard that if you want to convert your CSGO Sens to Valorant, then just divide it by 3.1818… This works if you want to relearn the Muscle Memory for Valorant. The 3.1818 number is not the best conversion if you want to retain your CSGO Muscle Memory. Why? Well, if you do divide your CSGO Sens by 3.1818, you will have a 5.78% error. This will make you work for your aim instead of letting you aim. This disparity occurs because both games have different FOVs. Valorant in general has a wider FOV and this messes up the 1:1 ratio for aim conversion aside from other factors.
 
Then how do you convert it? There is a long Mathematical process of getting the perfect Sens conversion. To save you time, all you have to do is divide your CSGO Sens by 3.370. This will more accurately convert your Sens for Valorant. Alternatively, if you multiply your Valorant Sens with 3.370, you will get your CSGO Sens. Even this conversion is not perfect as there is still an error margin of 1%. This is significantly better than the 3.18 conversion. Now just divide your Sens by 3.370 & you will be ready to battle in Valorant.
