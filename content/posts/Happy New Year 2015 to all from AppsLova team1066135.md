# Get Ready to Ring in the New Year with Appslova Team and a Special Surprise to Start 2015 off Right!

As the end of the year approaches, many of us are filled with excitement and anticipation for what the new year will bring. Perhaps we've set resolutions or goals to work towards in the coming months, or maybe we're just looking forward to a fresh start. No matter how we approach it, the new year is a time of reflection, celebration, and new beginnings.

Here at Appslova, we're no strangers to the excitement of the new year. As a team of dedicated developers and designers, we're always looking for ways to push ourselves and our projects to new heights. And this year, we're kicking off 2015 in style.

Starting on January 1st, Appslova is launching a special surprise that we're sure our users will love. We can't reveal too much just yet, but suffice it to say that it's a feature that we've been working on for months, and we're confident that it will take our app to the next level.

But that's not all we have planned. To celebrate the new year and our surprise launch, we're also hosting a special event on our website. From December 31st to January 3rd, users can enter to win a $100 gift card to a popular online retailer. It's our way of thanking our users for their support throughout 2014, and helping them start off the new year with a little extra spending money.

Of course, the new year is about more than just gifts and surprises. It's also a time to reflect on the year that's passed, and to set intentions and goals for the year to come. As a team, we're committed to making our apps the best they can be, and we'll be working hard to bring new features and improvements throughout 2015.

We also want to take this opportunity to thank our users for their feedback and support. Our apps wouldn't be what they are without the input and suggestions of our users, and we're grateful for the community we've built around our products.

As we prepare to ring in the new year, we hope that our users will join us in celebrating the excitement of new beginnings. Whether you're making resolutions, setting intentions, or simply looking forward to what the new year will bring, we wish you all the best as we enter 2015.

And don't forget to keep an eye out for our special surprise launch on January 1st! We can't wait to share it with you.


Well, year 2014 has officially ended now, with a lot of ups and downs. Today is the January 1st, 2015, the first day of the new year. The bygone year has given a lot more to us, in every fields, and already missing the year 2014, we all team members of Appslova.com wish you a very happy new year 2015!
 
The year 2014 was a year of quite an achievement for us. We continued to grow our rank in Alexa all over the year, though we fell down a bit in the past few weeks. However, as a newly established online tech magazine, we are doing everything we can, to fulfill our readersâ€™ desires and preparing the articles the way you want to read.
 

 
Though we are not the site which are fully focused on only one particular OS (we try to cover the news, reviews and blogs about smartphones and their accessories though), in the recent posts you can see a lot of our posts which are related mainly with the Android Operating System. This is because of the domination of the Android OS for the mobile platforms all over the world (it runs in about 84% of all smartphones), and most of our viewers are related to the Android as well. But we also try to cover the articles of other systems as well, which are the iOS, Windows, and Firefox. Though small in numbers, you can see those posts frequently appearing in the news feed of our site.
 
We hope the year 2015 will bring more joy, happiness and excitement to your life. This year we will also see the growth in the specs and features of smartphones, as in 2014. We are all set to provide every sort of information you want, relating to Mobile platform. Every sort of your suggestion and tips is important to us, contact us to share what you feel about AppsLova. Have a great new year! Cheers!
