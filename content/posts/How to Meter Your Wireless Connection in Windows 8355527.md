# 10 Surprising Ways to Boost Your Internet Speed on Windows 8 Now - You Won't Believe #6!

If you are using Windows 8 and are frustrated with slow internet speeds, you are not alone! Many users have reported slow loading times, buffering, and general sluggishness while browsing the web. Luckily, there are several ways to boost your internet speed on Windows 8, some of which may surprise you! Here are 10 tips to get you started:

## 1. Clear Your Cache

Your web browser stores information about the websites you visit in a cache, which can slow down your internet speed. Clearing your cache can help speed up your browsing, especially if you visit the same websites frequently. To clear your cache, go to your browser settings and select "Clear browsing data."

## 2. Disable Startup Programs

Having too many programs running in the background can slow down your internet speed. To disable startup programs, open the Task Manager by right-clicking on the taskbar and selecting "Task Manager." Then, click on the "Startup" tab and disable any programs you don't need running at startup.

## 3. Disable Background Apps

Some apps will continue running in the background even when you're not using them, using up valuable bandwidth. To disable background apps, go to your Windows settings and select "Privacy." Then, go to the "Background apps" section and turn off any apps you don't need running in the background.

## 4. Use a Network Cable

If you're using Wi-Fi, your internet speed may suffer from interference or weak signal. Using a network cable to connect directly to your modem or router can give you a faster and more stable connection.

## 5. Update Your Drivers

Outdated drivers can cause slow internet speed. Make sure you have the latest drivers installed for your network card or wireless adapter.

## 6. Use a VPN

A VPN can hide your online activity from your internet service provider and prevent them from throttling your internet speed. It can also give you access to geo-restricted content. You won't believe how much your internet speed can increase with a reliable VPN provider.

## 7. Use a Download Manager

A download manager can help you download files faster by breaking them up into smaller chunks and downloading them simultaneously. Some popular download managers include Free Download Manager, IDM, and FlashGet.

## 8. Disable Antivirus Software

Antivirus software can slow down your internet speed by scanning every website you visit. While it is important to have antivirus software installed, you can disable it temporarily while browsing the web to improve your internet speed.

## 9. Optimize Your Router

If you have a wireless router, you can optimize the settings to improve your internet speed. Make sure your router is in a central location in your home, away from walls and other obstacles that could interfere with the signal. You can also change the channel on your router to reduce interference from other wireless devices in your home.

## 10. Check Your Internet Plan

Finally, it's important to make sure you have the right internet plan for your needs. If your internet speed is consistently slow, you may need to upgrade your plan or switch to a different provider.

By following these tips, you can boost your internet speed on Windows 8 and enjoy a faster, smoother browsing experience. Give them a try and see the difference for yourself!

Wireless networks are starting to sprout up all over the place, giving people a new way to tap into the Internet through waves in the air. Still, carriers love to suck customers’ wallets dry when they exceed the bandwidth agreed upon in their plans. And, to top it off, Windows 8 blurs the line between the Internet and your desktop. It uses up bandwidth for an enormous amount of its operations and applications. You might have your laptop on for an hour and already have used up a large chunk of your bandwidth under this new operating system. In a spot of luck, Microsoft implemented something in Windows 8 that allows you to minimize the damage from using this OS in a stingy network, known as metering.

 
## What Connections Can I Meter?
 
You can meter any wireless connection, whether it be UMTS, Wi-Fi, HSDPA, 3G, 3GPP or whatever. The sky’s the limit.
 
## What Does Metering Do?
 
Metering your connection in Windows 8 will limit Windows Update to high-priority updates (if you have WU on at all), pause any downloads of any apps from the Windows Store, stop any automatic updating of Start screen app tiles, and stop any native syncing processes of offline files. This practically saves the biggest part of the bandwidth that Windows 8 consumes on a regular basis.
 
## What Metering Won’t Do
 
One of my biggest pet peeves is that Microsoft called this feature “metering.” Technically, one would understand that a metered connection has an established limit to how much it can download before the connection is either interrupted or continues with a surcharge. In conclusion, one would think that by “metered,” Microsoft means that Windows 8 will stop all activity when the connection has reached a transfer limit. This isn’t the way it works. A metered connection simply means that Windows 8 will limit how much it downloads on its own.
 
## How To Meter A Connection
 
This part’s so easy, you’ll be showing it off to your friends in no time! Just bring up the Charms bar, click “Settings,” then click “Network.” There, you’ll see a list of your network connections.
 

 
Right-click on the wireless network you’d like to meter, and then click “Set as metered connection.” This will conserve bandwidth and also give you access to other information.
 
## Other Stuff That Metering A Connection Lets You Do
 
Go back to your network list and right-click (or tap, if you’re using a touchscreen) your wireless connection. Now you’ll see a box showing you how much bandwidth you’ve used. This is very useful if you’re paying a monthly data plan for your wireless network. If you’re stumped about why you’re still using so much bandwidth, there’s still one more trick up my sleeve that shows you how much each app uses.
 
Go ahead and access your task manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc). Now, when you click the “App History” tab, you’ll see a column labeled “Metered network” on the list. This will show you how much bandwidth each app is using. This comes in very handy when diagnosing bandwidth consumption issues!
