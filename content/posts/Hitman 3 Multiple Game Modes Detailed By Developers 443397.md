# Wow! Hitman 3's Devs Spill The Beans On Explosive New Game Modes!

The wait is over for Hitman fans, as the recently launched Hitman 3 lived up to all its hype with its thrilling missions, explosive gameplay, and remarkable graphics. The game's various game modes offered a challenging and immersive experience, but the developers have added some new tricks up their sleeves to make the gameplay even more fun.

In an exclusive interview, IO Interactive, the game's developer, revealed some of the new features in Hitman 3. From new game modes to game-changing perks, Hitman 3's latest updates are sure to keep players hooked.

The first new addition in the game is the Elusive Targets mode, which pits gamers against a single target with a single opportunity to take them out. Fans of previous Hitman games will be familiar with these unique contracts, where players have a limited amount of time to take out a high-value target before the opportunity disappears. The Elusive Targets mode will create a sense of urgency among gamers, raising the stakes of the game to a whole new level.

Another exciting new mode is the Escalations mode. This fast-paced game mode will make Hitman 3 even more challenging and keep players on their toes. In Escalations mode, gamers have to complete a series of objectives in progressively challenging conditions. Each completed objective unlocks a new layer of difficulty, which will keep players engaged and challenged.

IO Interactive has also made significant changes to the game's all-new Contracts mode. Previously, players would only have the option to create contracts within a single level. But now, players will be able to create contracts across multiple levels, opening up a whole new world of possibilities.

Hitman 3's new game modes are not the only exciting updates unveiled in the IO Interactive interview. The developers have also added new perks and features to the game to make the gameplay even more immersive.

One such feature is the introduction of persistent shortcuts in the game. These shortcuts will remain open throughout the game, allowing players to access multiple areas easily. This new feature allows gamers to experiment with various routes, enhancing the replayability feature of the game.

In addition to these new game modes and features, IO Interactive has also hinted at the expansion of the game's weapon and item roster. These new additions will give sneakier players more opportunities to take out their targets without drawing too much attention.

In conclusion, IO Interactive has taken the already fantastic Hitman 3 to new heights with its latest updates. The new game modes and features will keep players entertained for hours, pushing their strategic and gaming skills to their limits. With the game's update serving as a testament to the developer's commitment to enhancing the overall gaming experience, Hitman 3 is one of the best games to date.
