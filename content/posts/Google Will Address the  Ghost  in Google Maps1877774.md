Are you a frequent user of Google Maps? Do you rely on the app to get directions to your favorite places? Well, brace yourself for a shock because Google has finally admitted to something that may leave you feeling uneasy.

Despite providing excellent services, Google has been under the scanner for promoting surveillance capitalism, where the company collects user data for its profit. And the latest admission about its Maps feature is no different.

According to a report by the Markup, Google Maps tracked users' whereabouts, even when they turned the “Location History” setting off. The company stated that the maps app would automatically store a user's location data when they used other Google services like Google Assistant or the Google search bar, even if they turned off the “Location History” option.

This revelation is not only shocking but also raises concerns about how honest Google is in respecting users’ privacy, particularly when it comes to location tracking. We all know that every time we use Google Maps, Google records our location to help provide traffic updates and accurate location-based recommendations, but this news takes it to another level.

The report also states that it is a common practice among ad-supported platforms such as Google to track users’ locations to enhance their ad experience. By knowing a user's whereabouts, they can make accurate assumptions about their interests, preferences, and behavioral patterns, making ads targeting and personalization more accurate, and probably disturbingly precise.

It's not clear how Google uses this location data, but given its track record and the company's aggressive application of user data to optimize profits, one can't help feeling a little apprehensive.

The issue of privacy and data protection is an ongoing concern for tech companies, and Google's latest admission about its Maps app is just another example of how we need to be vigilant about companies that hold our personal data. Users must be informed and have control over their personal data.

In conclusion, Google's admission about its Maps feature is a wake-up call for all of us to think about our digital footprints and question the privacy policies of service providers that we use daily. Hopefully, this admission prompts Google to be more transparent and respectful of users’ privacy by giving them better options and control over their data.

Google has stated that it's "working on a fix" for the mysterious voice that several users have begun hearing in Google Maps.

 

Both Android and iOS users have reported strange happenings in Google Maps, with the app's voice changing on its own. Many have shared accounts of the voice giving them directions suddenly shifting to a deep-voiced man with a slight accent. It seems the app will start by randomly swapping between this voice and the user's selected one a few times before eventually settling on this new one.

 

While this is obviously some sort of bizarre bug, there is still some mystery behind it. What's causing the voice to change like this? Why is it only changing to this specific voice? And as Reddit user fezguy pointed out, "...try finding this voice in the catalogs of voices for Google maps/assistance... I haven't been able to find it as an option." So this doesn't even seem to be a selectable voice option in the first place. Where did it come from?

 

The official Twitter account for Google Maps has responded to several users reporting similar vocal takeovers with the same statement: "The team is working on a fix and it will be rolled out soon." It has not yet given an explanation for the bizarre glitch, however. If you have an iPhone and want to avoid the issue without waiting for a patch, PhoneArena recommends switching over to Apple Maps instead.

 

We still don't know the cause and Google hasn't given an estimate as to when the problem will be fixed. For now we'll just have to have faith that "soon" means "within the next few days or weeks," and try not to panic if we suddenly hear and unexpected voice in the car.
