You can also use it to create grayscale structures, which can be aesthetically pleasing and can help you convey a specific mood or feeling.

If you're a teacher using Minecraft Education Edition, you can use bleach to help teach your students about color theory, minimalism, organization, and the importance of cleanliness in their workspaces. The possibilities are endless.
