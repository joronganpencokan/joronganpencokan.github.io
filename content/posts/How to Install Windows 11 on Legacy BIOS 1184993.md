Revive Your Old PC with the Ultimate Trick: Installing Windows 11 on Legacy Bios!

Do you own an old PC that is running on a legacy BIOS system? Are you looking for ways to give your old PC a new lease of life with the latest operating system? The good news is that you can now install Windows 11 on your old PC that has a legacy BIOS system. In this article, we will guide you through the process of installing Windows 11 on legacy BIOS and how you can revive your old PC.

Firstly, let's discuss what a legacy BIOS system is. A legacy BIOS system is an older type of system for initializing your PC. It was replaced by UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) systems, which are now used in most modern PCs. However, if you have an old PC with a legacy BIOS system, you can still install and run Windows 11 on it. Here's how.

The first step is to check if your PC is compatible with Windows 11. You can do this by using the PC Health Check app, which will tell you if your PC meets the minimum system requirements for running Windows 11. If your PC is not compatible, then you may need to upgrade some of its hardware components to meet the requirements.

The next step is to create a bootable USB drive with Windows 11 installation files. You can download the Windows 11 ISO file from Microsoft's website and use a tool like Rufus to create a bootable USB drive. Make sure to select the "MBR" partition scheme as the boot mode when creating the USB drive.

Once you have created the bootable USB drive, you need to change the boot order in the BIOS settings of your PC. To do this, restart your PC and press the key to access the BIOS settings (usually F2, F8, or F10). In the BIOS settings, go to the Boot tab and select the USB drive as the first boot device. Save the changes and restart your PC.

Now, Windows 11 installation should start automatically from the USB drive. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Windows 11. During the installation process, make sure to select the "Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)" option to choose where to install Windows 11. Select the partition where you want to install Windows 11, and follow the remaining instructions to complete the installation.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Windows 11 on your old PC with a legacy BIOS system. You can now enjoy the latest features and updates of Windows 11 on your old PC. However, keep in mind that older PCs may not be able to handle the performance demands of Windows 11, and you may experience slow speed or lag. To avoid this, make sure to optimize your PC's performance and upgrade hardware components if necessary.

In conclusion, installing Windows 11 on a legacy BIOS system is a great way to revive your old PC and give it a new lease of life. With a little effort and patience, you can enjoy the latest features of Windows 11 on your old PC. Give it a try and see how it works for you!

Windows 11 is strict on the system requirements needed to upgrade your computer to this latest operating system by Microsoft. Requirements like TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot are becoming one of the major reasons for not receiving Window 11 updates. This is why even 3-4 years old computers are standing incompatible with Windows 11. Fortunately, there are various ways to bypass these requirements. In this article, we are going to explore how to install Windows 11 on Legacy BIOS without Secure Boot or TPM 2.0.
 

 
## How to Install Windows 11 on Legacy BIOS without Secure Boot or TPM 2.0
 
### What is Secure Boot?
 
Secure Boot is a feature in start-up software in your computer that ensures your computer begins safely and securely by preventing unauthorized software, such as malware, from taking control of your computer at boot-up. If you have Windows 10 modern PC with UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), you are being protected from malicious software trying to take control of your computer when it starts up.

### What is TPM 2.0?
 
TPM stands for Trusted Platform Module. When you turn on a newer PC with full-disk encryption and a TPM, the little chip will generate a cryptographic key, which is a one-of-a-kind code. The drive encryption is unlocked and your computer will start up if everything is normal. Your PC would not boot up if there is a problem with the key, for example, if a hacker tried to tamper with the encrypted drive.
 
Both these features boost Windows 11 security making you the only person to log in to your computer.
 
There are many ways to bypass these checks. The following methods are efficient to install Windows 11 on legacy BIOS without Secure Boot and TPM 2.0.
 
### Method 1: Use Third-party App

 
Rufus is a well-known free tool used in the Windows community to create Bootable USB drives. In the beta version of Rufus, you get the option to bypass Secure Boot and TPM checks. Here is how to install Windows 11 on legacy BIOS:
 
1. Download Rufus BETA version from its official website.
 
2. Then, download the Windows 11 ISO file from Microsoft website.
