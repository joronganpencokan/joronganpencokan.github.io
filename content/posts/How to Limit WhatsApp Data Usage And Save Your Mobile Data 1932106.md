Stop Wasting Your Mobile Data! Learn How To Slash Your WhatsApp Usage in Half Now!

If you're like most people who use WhatsApp, you probably spend a lot of your mobile data on the app. Whether it's texting your friends, sending voice notes, or making video calls, WhatsApp uses a considerable amount of data. And with most mobile data plans being limited, this can be a concern for many people.

But the good news is that there are ways to reduce your WhatsApp data usage so that you can enjoy the app without worrying about exceeding your data limits. Here are some tips to help you slash your WhatsApp usage in half:

1. Turn off WhatsApp auto-download: By default, WhatsApp automatically downloads all media files, including images, videos, and voice notes, as soon as they are sent to you. This can use up your data quickly, especially if you receive a lot of media files. To save your data, you can turn off the auto-download feature in WhatsApp settings. Go to “Settings” > “Data and Storage Usage” > “Media Auto-Download,” and uncheck all the options.

2. Use WhatsApp Wi-Fi only: If you're on a limited data plan, you should switch to Wi-Fi whenever possible to save your data. You can do this in WhatsApp by going to “Settings” > “Data and Storage Usage” > “When Using Mobile Data” and enabling the “Use Less Data” option. This will reduce the amount of data that WhatsApp uses when you're not on Wi-Fi.

3. Disable WhatsApp notifications: WhatsApp notifications can be distracting and annoying, but they can also use up your data. If you're constantly receiving notifications, then you're using data without even realizing it. To prevent this, you can disable WhatsApp notifications in your phone's settings.

4. Limit your voice and video calls: Voice and video calls on WhatsApp can use up a lot of data, so it's a good idea to limit them if you're on a limited data plan. You can also reduce the quality of your calls in WhatsApp settings to save data. Go to “Settings” > “Data and Storage Usage” > “Voice Calls” or “Video Calls” and select a lower quality option.

5. Use WhatsApp Web: If you frequently use WhatsApp on your computer, you can use WhatsApp Web to save your mobile data. WhatsApp Web mirrors your phone's WhatsApp account on your computer, so you can use it to send and receive messages without using your phone's data.

In conclusion, WhatsApp can be an excellent tool for staying connected with your friends and family, but it's essential to manage your data usage carefully. By following these tips, you can significantly reduce your WhatsApp data usage and save money on your mobile data plan.

Mobile data is something that everyone is always trying to save. Some users have unlimited plans, but not everyone is lucky enough to have one. Mobile data does have restrictions and saving it can be a difficult task, especially when you’re using WhatsApp.
 
It’s an app you probably need to use every day but are afraid to launch because of the amount of mobile data it uses. Instead of having your blood pressure through the roof worrying about how much data the app is using, try the following mobile data saving tips.
 
## Disable WhatsApp Chat Backup with Cellular Data
 
If you’re using WhatsApp on an iPhone, then back up your chat to iCloud. If you don’t make the necessary changes, you’re going to get the most expensive phone bill ever. To turn off cellular data for iCloud you need to go to “Settings -> iCloud -> iCloud Drive -> Use Cellular Data -> Toggle Off.”
 

 
What you can do instead is choose when you want to back up your chats such as when you’re at home connected to your WiFi. You can do this by going to “Settings -> Chat Settings -> Chat Backup -> Backup Now” in the app.
 
If you’re on Android, then your chat history is being backed up to Google Drive. To save on mobile data, try backing up your chat history only when you’re on WiFi. You can do that by opening “WhatsApp -> Settings -> Chats -> Chat Backup -> Backup over -> WiFi.”
 
## Stop WhatsApp from Auto-Saving Media
 
If you don’t care about saving the media you usually get on WhatsApp, or you want to decide later what you want to keep, there’s an option for that, too. If you’re on an iPhone, go to “WhatsApp -> Settings -> Chat and Calls -> Save Incoming Media -> Toggle off.”
 
To do the same on your Android device, open “WhatsApp -> Settings -> Data Usage -> When using mobile data.” Now choose what you want WhatsApp to download and what it shouldn’t. You just have to uncheck what you want and what you don’t, and WhatsApp will stop saving it.
 
## Make WhatsApp Use Less Data During Calls
 
In the WhatsApp Settings there is also an option to save cellular data during calls. There isn’t a drastic change in the quality of the call, but don’t be surprised if it’s a little less than usual. Give it a try and see if it’s something you’re willing to consider.
 
You can enable this option by going to WhatsApp settings and then Data Usage. The lower data usage option is all the way at the bottom. Check it “On,” and the next time you’re on a call, WhatsApp won’t  use so much data. On iPhone the steps are the same except that you’ll see Data and Storage Usage, and Low Data Usage will need to be toggled “On.”
 
## Conclusion
 
WhatsApp is the most popular instant messaging app out there. Since that’s the case, you’re probably not going to have much of a choice but to use it. But with these useful tips you’ll know what to do to save as much cellular data as possible. What are some of your mobile data saving tips? Drop a comment below and let us know.
