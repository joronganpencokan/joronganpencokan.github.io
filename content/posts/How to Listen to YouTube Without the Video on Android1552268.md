# Revolutionary Trick to Enjoy YouTube Audio without Draining Your Battery on Android

YouTube is a hub of content, and watching videos on it can be an excellent way to kill time. However, if you often listen to music videos, podcasts or lectures on YouTube, it can be frustrating to lose battery life of your Android device in the process. Fortunately, there's a revolutionary trick that enables you to enjoy YouTube audio without putting a strain on your battery.

## The Trick

The trick involves using a reliable YouTube video to MP3 converter app that allows you to download the audio track from a YouTube video. It’s an excellent solution, especially when you're on the move, have limited internet access, or want to save data. In fact, after the audio has been downloaded, you can enjoy your favorite video tracks offline, without worrying about data caps or internet connectivity.

## How to Download Audio from YouTube Videos

Downloading audio from YouTube videos is effortless with the right application. We suggest using the SnapTube app, which is reliable, fast, and has been downloaded and used by millions of users worldwide. Simply follow the steps below:

1. Download the SnapTube app from the website, and install it on your Android device.
2. Open the YouTube app and find the video you want to download.
3. Click on the “share” button and select the “Copy link” option.
4. Open the SnapTube app, and in the search bar, paste the link previously copied from the YouTube app.
5. Once you locate the video on SnapTube, select the audio quality and format you want to download. You may choose from high-quality MP3, M4A audio, or AAC audio formats.
6. Finally, click on the download button to begin the audio download process.

You can then listen to your favorite music, podcast, or lecture offline without worrying about battery life. 

## Additional Tips to Save Battery Life

While downloading audio from YouTube videos can be a great way to save battery life, there are other tips you can use to extend the life of your battery. Here are a few additional tips:

- Close unnecessary apps running in the background
- Dim the brightness of your screen
- Turn off Bluetooth, GPS, and Wi-Fi when not in use
- Use battery saver mode or low power mode on your device, if available

By implementing these tips, you should be able to stretch out your battery life considerably.

## Conclusion

The revolutionary trick of downloading audio from YouTube videos can help you enjoy your favorite music, podcasts, or lectures without putting a strain on your device's battery. By using the SnapTube app or any other reliable YouTube to MP3 converter, you can listen to high-quality audio offline, without worrying about data caps or internet connectivity.

I’m normally pretty frugal with my mobile data, but when I got a fancy new contract with a 7GB data limit, I got careless. I got into the habit of listening to long music videos, talks, DJ sets and so on on YouTube, then just putting my phone in my pocket. Last month, just a week after my data allowance reset for the new month, I’d crossed the 7GB threshold, and I blame it all on YouTube.
 
Another problem with listening to stuff on YouTube is that you have to leave the screen on, which is both a pain and a battery drain (pardon the rhyme).
 
Luckily, there’s a solution for this for Android users (outside of being organized and pre-loading stuff you want to watch/listen to on YouTube Go). It comes in the form of an excellent app called FireTube which lets you listen to YouTube videos without the video, slashing significantly that data and battery usage.
 

 
## Download and Install FireTube
 
FireTube is not available on the Play Store, so here’s how to get your hands on it and set yourself up for video-free YouTube listening.
 
First, you’ll need to download the FireTube APK on your Android device. Use this link to download the latest version of FireTube (1.4.2) at the time of writing. To download the app, you may need to enable unknown sources on your phone. To do this, go to “Settings -> Security” and switch on the slider for “Unknown sources.”
 
Note: if you are are likely to install the APK file from an unknown source, you can use NVISO ApkScan or AndroTotal to scan the APK file first before installing.
 
Once the APK has downloaded, open it and follow the instructions to install it.
 
Next, open FireTube, and you’ll be presented with a YouTube-like interface showing you a bunch of Hot Tracks. Despite its music-focused presentation where tapping the search button prompts you to type in song or artist names, you can actually search for any video on YouTube and listen to it without the video.
 
## How to Listen to YouTube without Video
 
Now, for the crucial part. You may have noticed that by default FireTube plays YouTube videos with the video which kind of defeats the point. But don’t worry because switching it all off is easy.
 
Just go to Settings in FireTube, then untick the box for “Always Video Mode.” Videos will now just play as audio with a thumbnail image of the video on the screen.
 
In the Settings screen you can also choose the default media player app for the stuff you play, which it’ll switch to when you leave FireTube and continue using your device with music in the background.
 
## Conclusion
 
And there you have it: a nice and simple way to overcome the triple-headed problem of listening to YouTube in the background on your device, without video, and with your screen turned off. Naturally, Google isn’t a big fan of FireTube because it works around a problem that Google charges money to solve themselves (YouTube Red), but that needn’t concern you. If you’re in the Google ecosystem, then rest easy knowing that Google profits plenty from your data already!
