# Discover the Secret to Reinstalling Windows without Losing Any Files - Your Computer Will Run Like New Again!

Is your computer running slow, freezing, or showing errors? If so, it may be time to reinstall the operating system. Reinstalling Windows can solve a host of issues, but it can also be a hassle if you have to back up and transfer all your files. This fear of data loss may be preventing you from getting your computer running like new again. Fortunately, there is a way to reinstall Windows without losing any of your files. In this article, we'll share with you the secret to reinstalling Windows without losing any files, so you can get your computer working like it did when you first bought it. 

## The Traditional Way to Reinstall Windows and The Problems It Presents

The traditional way to reinstall Windows involves backing up all your files to an external hard drive or cloud storage, formatting your hard disk, and reinstalling Windows from scratch. Once Windows is installed, it's time to manually transfer your files back onto your computer. While this method can be effective in reinstalling the operating system, it's time-consuming and requires you to have a backup plan in place. Also, it requires you to have significant storage space either in the form of an external hard drive or cloud storage, which can be expensive depending on the amount of data you have.

However, this process also presents several problems. First and foremost, there is the time it takes to back up all your data. If you are dealing with a large amount of data or have a slower internet connection, uploading your files to a cloud storage service can be frustratingly slow. Second, you will need to allocate storage space on a separate drive to store the backed-up files. This process can be time-consuming and can cause issues with other applications on your system. Third, even if you have your files backed up, there is always the risk of losing data. This risk can manifest itself in a variety of ways, such as problems with the backup process or other unforeseen issues. 

## The Secret to Reinstalling Windows Without Losing Any Files

What if we told you there was a way to reinstall Windows without losing any of your files? Thankfully, there is - with the help of a nifty tool called Reset Windows. This tool can restore a Windows computer to its default settings without removing any files. The best part about it is that it runs natively in Windows, so you don't need any third-party software and it doesn't require any significant storage space. Reset Windows can be especially helpful if your computer has accumulated unwanted software or if it's running slow or freezing. 

Reset Windows is a built-in feature that allows you to reset your computer back to its factory settings. But, unlike traditional methods, it lets you keep all your files and settings in place. The tool reinstalls Windows, removes any programs or drivers that may be causing issues, and cleans up your system. It's an excellent way to get your computer working like it did when you first bought it, without sacrificing any of your files or settings. 

## How to Use Reset Windows

Using Reset Windows is incredibly easy. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Open the Settings app by pressing the Windows key + I or clicking on the gear icon in the Start menu. 

2. Select the "Update & Security" option.

3. Click on the "Recovery" option on the left sidebar.

4. Under "Reset this PC," click on the "Get Started" button. 

5. Choose "Keep my files" on the next page, and follow the prompts. 

6. Wait for the process to complete. Your computer will restart several times during the process.

Once the process is complete, your computer should be working like new again, without having to worry about losing any files. 

## Conclusion

## Steps to Reinstall Windows Without Losing Data


So, if you are also searching for the same, the good thing is that we have a method that would help you reinstall Windows without losing any single data stored on the device. So, in this article, we will share a working method that would help you reinstall Windows without losing data.

 
### Backup Your Data


Things could go horribly wrong, so you need to make a backup of your entire drive. In this way, you can return to where you were before the reinstall. You also have to create a backup of your data because the reinstall might destroy everything on your hard drive.
The best way is cloning the system, and for that, I recommend the tool “EaseUS todo Backup“, which performs both image backups and cloning.
For this job, I recommend cloning because it will make the later job of restoring the data files easier. On the other hand, image backup doesn’t require an external drive all to itself. Either option will work.

Apart from EaseUS Todo backup, you can use any other backup programs for this purpose. We have shared a list of best Best Cloud File Storage and Backup Services that you can consider.
If you are using any backup service to restore files and folders, then only back up the files. Also, make sure to exclude the Windows system installation files.
You also need to take proper backup of your Windows Drivers, and for that, you need to follow the guide How to Backup and Restore Drivers on Windows 7, 8 & 10.

 
### Windows Reinstallation


How you replace an old windows installation with a new one depends on your recovery tool and your PC vendor. If your PC came with a recovery partition on the hard drive, find the instructions for booting into the repair environment, or you can also search on the internet for the default key of your PC.
Watch the screen as you turn on the computer; it might show a message such as “Press F10 for Repair“. If your recovery tool is an actual Microsoft windows disc, the tool will ask what kind of installation to perform.
You want the type that gives you a fresh version of Windows. For Windows 7,8,8/8.1,10 or Vista, when the wizard asks about the type of installation, select the Custom option.

Note: While you go to custom settings, you must format only the partition where windows were installed previously. You shouldn’t touch the other partitions.

 
#### -> Setting Up Windows


Congrats.!! You have a fresh Windows installation. Now the hard work starts from here. Remember that windows will need updating. The patching will happen automatically, but if you want to get it out of the way, launch Windows Update and take care of it.

Now that you’ve cleaned windows of unwanted applications, you have to reinstall all the programs and drivers you want to have on your PC. Start with your security tools like antiviruses, and go from there.
Don’t try to install two programs at the same time and if an installation requires a reboot, make sure to perform a reboot. Once everything is installed, set the wallpaper, change your power and screensaver settings, and so on.

 
### Restoring the Files


After reinstalling the Windows operating system, you need to restore the files you have backed up in the first step. First, restore the backup file that you have created to get back the data.
