# The Ultimate Elden Ring Leveling Guide Revealed! Level Up Your Character Like A Pro! 

Elden Ring is the latest addition to the action role-playing video game genre, which is set to release on February 25, 2022. It is a highly anticipated game that has gained a lot of attention from gamers all around the world since it is created by FromSoftware, the very company behind the iconic Soulsborne series. 

Like every other RPG, Elden Ring too comes with a leveling system that allows you to improve your character's attributes, skills, and abilities over time. However, the game's intricate mechanics might seem complex and confusing at first, and you might be wondering where to start. 

If you're feeling lost in Elden Ring, don't worry - we've got you covered! In this article, we will guide you through everything you need to know about leveling up like a pro in Elden Ring. So, without further ado, let's dive into the ultimate Elden Ring leveling guide! 

## Understanding the Leveling System 

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of leveling up, here are a few fundamentals you need to know about the leveling system in Elden Ring. The game has a total of 8 attributes that you can level up, each of which affects different aspects of your character. They are as follows: 

- Strength: Determines your character's physical attack power and equipment load
- Dexterity: Increases your character's agility, speed and determines ranged attack power 
- Endurance: Determines your character's stamina and resistance to exhaustion 
- Vitality: Increases your character's health and resistance to damage 
- Intelligence: Affects spellcasting and spell power 
- Faith: Affects miracles and miracle power 
- Luck: Determines item discovery rate and some critical stats 
- Charisma: Affects a character's dialogue choices and influence with NPCs 

Each time you level up, you gain 1 point that you can allocate to an attribute of your choosing. The higher the level of an attribute is, the more points it requires to level up. Moreover, leveling up attributes costs souls, which you earn by defeating enemies or selling items. 

## Tips on Leveling Up Quickly 

Now that you understand the basics of the leveling system, here are a few tips to help you level up your character quickly and efficiently: 

1. Prioritize Strength and Vitality: In Elden Ring, the physical combat system is challenging, and it's vital to have a high health pool and heavy-hitting weapons to survive. Therefore, it's best to prioritize leveling up Strength and Vitality first. 

2. Learn to Parry and Backstab: Parrying and Backstabbing are two essential combat mechanics in Elden Ring that allow you to deal massive amounts of damage to enemies. It's crucial to master these mechanics as soon as possible to progress quickly and gather more souls. 

3. Invest in Endurance and Dexterity: Endurance and Dexterity are two attributes that become essential to level up after you've upgraded Strength and Vitality. Endurance affects your character's stamina, which is crucial in maintaining combos and blocking enemy attacks. Dexterity, on the other hand, affects your character's speed and accuracy, which are essential for ranged combat. 

4. Experiment with Spells and Miracles: Elden Ring features a vast array of spells and miracles that offer unique abilities and buffs to your character. Experimenting with these and upgrading Intelligence and Faith will unlock new spells and miracles, transforming your character into a magical powerhouse. 

5. Don't Neglect Luck and Charisma: Although Luck and Charisma might seem insignificant at first glance, upgrading them can offer significant advantages in the long run. A higher luck level increases your item discovery rate, allowing you to find better gear more often. A higher Charisma level makes your character more influential with NPCs, unlocking unique dialogue and questline options. 

## Final Thoughts 

In conclusion, leveling up in Elden Ring requires patience, consistency, and experimentation. It's essential to understand the leveling system and allocate points wisely to become a formidable force in the game. With our Ultimate Elden Ring Leveling Guide, you're now equipped with the knowledge and tips on how to level up like a pro.

How to level up in Elden Ring? This guide will attempt to answer this question. Elden Ring is a beautiful, terrifying and brutal open-world with an amazing solo campaign as well as multiplayer options. If you are well-versed with games by From Software, this will be a thrilling ride. But just in case this is your first foray into this style of action role-playing game, you might be curious to know how to level up and progress faster. Here’s what you need to know about stats and leveling.
 
## How to Level Up Character in Elden Ring?
 
- Players can level up in Elden Ring by resting and interacting with the menu at any Site of Grace.
 - When you reach the third one, you unlock the option to level up.
 - You will meet Melina who will let you level up at any location of Site of Grace throughout Elden Ring.
 - Once you are ready, head to the menu options and pick the stats and attributes you want to increase.
 - This will use up the runes that you have collected over time, so make sure to do this at the right time and assign them wisely.
 - These Sites of Grace are easy to spot because they are illuminated with a gold aura. So if you have played Dark Souls, these are similar to the bonfires in the game. They are checkpoints that also let you do other things. You can also summon a player for co-op near a Site of Grace location. Plus, when you die, you will respawn here as well.

## How Does the Leveling System Work?
 
In games like Assassin’s Creed, you need to keep playing and defeating bosses to automatically level up. That isn’t the case in this game. You must collect runes by killing enemies and then visit a Site of Grace to manually level up. Here, stats come into the picture. Based on your playstyle, you can decide which stat you want to increase and level up.
 
### Elden Ring Stats to Increase
 
These are the stats in the game that you can choose to focus on. Make sure you have a plan about how you want to progress, which class you are choosing/have chosen, and accordingly, level up. Every player will have something different based on their playstyle, and this certainly adds to the replayability of the game.
 
#### Vigor
 
Attribute related to HP. This impacts your fire and poison resistance. When you rest at a Site of Grace, your HP, FP, and Stamina gets filled up entirely but your enemies also respawn.
 
#### Mind
 
Attribute related to FP (Focus Points). These points are used for casting Sorceries and Incantations. Impacts focus-related resistances. FP is shown on your HUD in a blue bar.
 
#### Dexterity
 
Attribute related to wielding weapons. You will need this to use fast and light items. When you increase Dexterity, the damage of Dexterity scaling items is increased. Also reduces your spell casting time, fall damage and makes it tougher to be thrown off your mount.
 
#### Intelligence
 
Attribute related to performing Glintstone sorceries. Leveling it up will also increase max FP, the magic power of intelligence-scaling sorceries, and enhances magic resistance. So, this is ideal for those interested in wielding magical items and inflicting sorcery damage.
 
#### Faith
 
Attribute related to performing Sacred Incantations and wielding magical items. Increasing this stat will give you increased Incantation damage and damage with Faith-scaling items.
 
#### Arcane
 
Attribute related to Discovery. Impacts Death Resistance and also some sorceries and incantations. Basically, this is a stat that affects your chances of finding items.
 
#### Endurance
 
Attribute related to Stamina. This will impact your physical defense power, robustness and also helps increase your max equipment load. Robustness is basically you have resistance to bleeding as well as frostbite.
 
#### Strength
 
Attribute related to wielding heavy weapons. It will also increase the attack power of strength-scaling weapons.
 
These stats have different effects on your character’s HP, Stamina, and more. Make the right choice based on the type of build you are going for. As you can tell, you can focus on leveling Strength, Dexterity, and Vigor if you are building a melee character. But for magic-based characters, the choices will be different. Or, you could mix and match both styles – it’s entirely up to you.
