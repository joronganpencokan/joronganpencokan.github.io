Introduction
Passwords are the key to accessing your personal accounts and keeping your data secure. Unfortunately, it can be a hassle to remember a different password for each service you use. Furthermore, if you forget your password or simply don't want to use it anymore, it can be difficult to reset it without knowing your old one. In this article, we present a brilliant password hack that will allow you to unlock your Windows 10 computer without knowing your old password.

The Problem with Traditional Passwords
Passwords have been the primary method of protecting user accounts since the beginning of the digital era. While they provide a fair amount of security, they also come with several issues. Firstly, passwords can be easily forgotten and require frequent resets. Secondly, if someone gains access to your password, they can easily obtain access to all your data.

The Hack
This hack involves using a Windows installation disk to access the computer's command prompt. The method involves replacing the sticky keys program with the command prompt. Sticky keys is a feature in Windows that allows the user to press the shift key five times to activate a special accessibility feature.

To start, insert the Windows installation disk and restart the computer. Select the option to boot from the disk and choose the appropriate language and keyboard settings. Next, select the "repair your computer" option and navigate to the command prompt.

Once in the command prompt, type the following command: copy c:\windows\system32\sethc.exe c:\ and press enter. This will make a backup of the sticky keys program. Then, type the following command: copy c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe c:\windows\system32\sethc.exe and press enter. This will replace the sticky keys program with the command prompt.

Finally, restart the computer and press the shift key five times to activate the command prompt. From here, you can change your password to something new, or simply leave it blank if you don't want to use a password.

Conclusion
Passwords are a necessary part of keeping your data secure, but they can be a nuisance to manage. By using this simple hack, you can bypass the need for your old password and regain access to your Windows 10 computer. However, use this hack responsibly and only on your own personal computer. If you have any concerns about the security of your online accounts, consider using a password manager or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to protect them further.
