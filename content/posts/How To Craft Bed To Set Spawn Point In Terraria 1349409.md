Terraria is all about adventures and crafting equipment in the game. However, while you’re on the journey better be careful & alert, or else you might not survive for long. That’s because the environment is full of enemies and hazardous creatures. In this case, we recommend you set your Spawn Point whenever you get the chance. Without any spawn point, you’ll lose your progress and end up where you first entered the game, which is known as the World Spawn point. If you’re unaware of the process to set a Spawn Point in Terraria, then we’ve got you covered.
 
## How to Create a Spawn Point in Terraria?
 

 
To set a Spawn Point in Terraria you’ll need to create a room and place a Bed in it. After placing a Bed simply press the Open/Activate button on it and you’ll be good to go. As soon as you do that you’ll see a Spawn Point Set message on the left corner of your screen.
 
However, make sure you don’t place the bed in the open, or else the respawn point won’t work. The room should be 7 blocks wide and 5 blocks high minimum, and shouldn’t be constructed with dirt. Now, whenever you die in the game you’ll respawn in your Bed being fully safe and sound. Once a spawn point is set the player will see a green arrow icon on the mini-map notifying the respawn point.
