# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Silence Annoying Email Threads on iOS 13!

As an iPhone user, you might be well-aware of how troublesome it can be to manage emails. The constant notifications, never-ending threads, and unsolicited messages can be overwhelming, especially when you need to stay focused on important tasks. 

Thankfully, iOS 13 has made managing emails a lot easier, thanks to its new "mute thread" feature. With a simple tap, you can silence a thread that's been clogging up your inbox, and enjoy some peace and quiet without missing on important messages.

Here's how you can use the "mute thread" feature on iOS 13: 

## Step 1: Open the email thread

To mute an email thread, you need to open it first. Find the thread you want to silence and tap on it to open it. 

## Step 2: Tap on the "More" button

Once you've opened the email thread, look for the "More" button. It's located on the top-right corner of your screen, represented by three dots in a circle.

## Step 3: Select "Mute"

After you tap on the "More" button, a dropdown menu will appear. Select the "Mute" option from the menu, and you're done. 

## Step 4: Unmute the thread (if necessary)

When you're ready to start receiving notifications from the muted thread again, follow the same steps as above, and select the "Unmute" option instead of "Mute." 

That's it! You've successfully muted an email thread on iOS 13. 

But what exactly happens when you mute an email thread? 

When you mute an email thread, you stop receiving notifications from it. That means you won't hear any alert sounds or feel any vibrations when a new email arrives in that thread. Plus, the thread won't appear as a new message badge on your iPhone's Home screen. But don't worry! You'll still be able to access the thread and reply to emails as usual. 

In conclusion, the new "mute thread" feature on iOS 13 is an excellent way to declutter your inbox and stay focused on important tasks. By muting annoying email threads, you can reduce distractions, lower stress levels, and boost productivity. So if you haven't tried it yet, give it a shot, and see the difference it makes!
