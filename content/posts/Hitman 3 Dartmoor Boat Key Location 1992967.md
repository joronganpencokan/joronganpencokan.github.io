# Unravel the Mystery: Exclusive Guide to Finding Hitman 3 Dartmoor Boat Key Location!

Hitman 3, the latest installment of the Hitman franchise, has recently been released and fans of the series have been enjoying the game's new levels, mechanics, and challenges. One of the most interesting levels of the game is the Dartmoor level, which takes place in a large mansion in the English countryside. The level presents a challenging mystery that players must solve, as they must discover the truth behind the death of the mansion's head of the family. To complete the level successfully, players must also gain access to a hidden room located beneath the mansion. To do this, they need to find the location of the boat key in order to unlock the secret entrance to the room where the weapons are stashed. In this guide, we will unravel the mystery of the boat key's location and help you find it to complete the mission.

## Step 1: Disguise Yourself

Before you can start your search for the boat key, you need to disguise yourself as a member of the mansion's staff or family. This is crucial to avoid being detected by the mansion's security staff and to blend in with the environment. There are several disguises available in the level, including the gardener, the detective, and the butler. Each disguise has its unique advantages, and you should choose the one that suits your play style.

## Step 2: Investigate the Mansion

Once you have disguised yourself, you need to start investigating the mansion to find clues that will lead you to the boat key's location. There are several areas of the mansion that you need to explore, including the office, the library, the dining room, and the bedrooms. These areas offer several clues that can help you solve the mystery of the death of the mansion's head of the family, and they may also lead you to the location of the boat key.

## Step 3: Follow the Clues

As you investigate the mansion, you will come across several clues that can help you solve the mystery and find the boat key. One of the most important clues is a key that you can find in the office. This key unlocks a secret room located in the mansion's basement, where you can find more clues that will help you complete the mission. Follow the clues you find, including secret documents and hidden passages, to get closer to discovering the location of the boat key.

## Step 4: Find the Boat Key

The boat key is located in the mansion's boathouse, which is located on the lake behind the mansion. To get there, you need to go outside and make your way to the back of the mansion. Be careful not to be detected by the mansion's security staff, as they can blow your cover and alert the other members of the family. Once you reach the boathouse, look for a small table located behind a large wooden crate on the right side of the house. The boat key is located on the table, and you can pick it up to unlock the secret entrance to the hidden weapons room.

## Step 5: Complete the Mission

With the boat key in your possession, you can now unlock the secret entrance to the weapons room located beneath the mansion. The entrance is located behind a large bookshelf in the library, and you need to use the boat key to open it. Inside the secret room, you can find a wide range of weapons, including a sniper rifle, a shotgun, and various handguns. Use these weapons to complete the mission, and make your escape before the other members of the family discover your presence.

In conclusion, finding the boat key in the Hitman 3 Dartmoor level can be a challenging task, but with the right strategy and attention to detail, it can be achieved. Follow the steps outlined in this guide to unravel the mystery of the boat key's location and successfully complete the mission. Good luck on your journey, Agent!

While you are at it, though, remember to remain undetected from NPCs, especially those who can see through your disguise. If someone spots you while you are picking the lock or using the crowbar, the guards will know of your activity. If you opt for the Crowbar method, you will find one on some boxes near the Greenhouse.
