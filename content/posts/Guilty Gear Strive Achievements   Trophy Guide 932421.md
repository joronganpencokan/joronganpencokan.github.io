# Unlock Rare and Secret Achievements in Guilty Gear Strive with This Ultimate Trophy Guide

If you're fond of fighting games, then you must've heard of Guilty Gear Strive. This game is a fighting masterpiece, attracting players with its fast-paced action and stunning visuals. However, Guilty Gear Strive has more to offer than just the thrills of combat. It has a plethora of achievements that players can unlock, such as rare trophies and secret achievements.

In this ultimate trophy guide, we'll reveal how to unlock these elusive trophies and secret achievements in Guilty Gear Strive. So, grab a controller, buckle up, and dive into the world of Guilty Gear Strive.

## Blitz Hawk

The Blitz Hawk achievement is one of the most difficult to unlock in Guilty Gear Strive. To achieve it, you must perform the instant kill move, an advanced in-game technique that's challenging to pull off.

Here's how to do it: when your opponent has a sliver of health left, press all four face buttons on your controller simultaneously. If done correctly, your character will perform the instant kill move, and you'll unlock the Blitz Hawk trophy.

## Mission Possible

Completing mission mode in Guilty Gear Strive unlocks the Mission Complete trophy. However, completing every mission with an S-rank unlocks the secret Mission Possible achievement. The S-rank demands strict timing, mastery of advanced moves, and perfect execution. It's a test of your skills as a fighter and will put your abilities to the test.

## The World Is Yours

The World Is Yours is one of the rarest trophies in Guilty Gear Strive, and you'll need a lot of skill and patience to unlock it. To achieve it, you must win every match in Survival Mode without losing once. Survival Mode consists of ten rounds against AI opponents, increasing in difficulty as you progress.

Surviving all ten rounds without losing is a challenging task. You'll need to master advanced fighting tactics to win each round and persist through the grueling ten rounds to unlock The World Is Yours achievement.

## Glossy

The Glossy trophy can be a challenging one to unlock if you're not careful. To get this achievement, you must earn all character colors and titles. Each character has several unlockable color and title combinations that require completing specific in-game challenges or making progress in the game's story mode.

The challenge is to keep track of each character's requirement and complete them all. Some of the color and title combinations can be particularly hard to earn, so you'll need to be persistent to unlock the Glossy trophy.

## Ultimate Battler

The Ultimate Battler trophy is a testament to your fighting prowess in Guilty Gear Strive. To achieve it, you must win 100 matches online. Winning 100 online matches requires a lot of skill and time, so make sure you're up for the task before attempting this achievement.

The key to winning online matches is mastering your chosen character and honing your skills in practice mode. Perfect execution of combos, quick reflexes, and strategic moves can all aid in taking you to the top.

## Conclusion

Guilty Gear Strive has some of the most challenging and rewarding achievements in the gaming world. From instant kill moves to winning online matches, these trophies test your skills to the limit. But with this ultimate trophy guide, you'll be better equipped to tackle these challenges head-on and earn these rare achievements.

So, grab your controller and start your journey towards unlocking these rare trophies and secret achievements in Guilty Gear Strive. The glory, the satisfaction, and the bragging rights are all worth it. Good luck!
