Introduction

Are you tired of typing on your Android keyboard with cramped fingers? Do you wish your keyboard was bigger and more comfortable to use? Well, you're in luck! In this article, we will take you through simple steps to make your Android keyboard bigger and more user-friendly.

Step 1: Change the Keyboard Size

The first step to making your Android keyboard bigger is changing its size. Fortunately, many Android devices allow you to adjust the keyboard's size to your preference.

Here's how to do it:

1. Go to your Android device's Settings and select "System."

2. Scroll down and select "Languages and Input."

3. Tap on "Virtual Keyboard," then select the keyboard you're using.

4. Select "Keyboard Size" and adjust the size to your preference.

Step 2: Use a Third-Party Keyboard App

If adjusting the size of your keyboard doesn't work, you can try using a third-party keyboard app. There are several keyboard apps that offer larger keys and more comfortable typing experience for Android users.

Here are some popular keyboard apps you can try:

1. Gboard – This is Google's keyboard app, and it offers a wide range of features, including adjustable size, theme customization, and gesture typing.

2. SwiftKey – This keyboard app is known for its predictive typing feature, and it also allows you to resize the keyboard to your preference.

3. Fleksy – This keyboard app is perfect for people who prefer large keys and easy-to-use gestures.

Step 3: Use a Keyboard Dock

Another way to make your Android keyboard bigger is by using a keyboard dock. A keyboard dock is a device that allows you to connect your Android device to a physical keyboard, making typing more comfortable and faster.

You can buy a keyboard dock online or at an electronics store. Once you have a keyboard dock, you can connect it to your Android device and start typing away.

Conclusion

By following the steps in this article, you can make your Android keyboard bigger and easier to use. Whether you adjust your keyboard's size, use a third-party keyboard app, or connect a keyboard dock, you'll be able to type faster and with more ease. So, what are you waiting for?

##   How to Make a Keyboard Bigger on Android  
 

These steps will make a keyboard bigger on Android and will work on all Android 11 phones that use the default Settings app.

The above method is the only way to change the font size of the default Android keyboard on most phones that use a stock or near-stock interface. Android has a Font Size setting but counter to what you might expect; this doesn't change the keyboard's font size.

 

Open the Settings app.

 

Tap Display.

 

Tap Advanced.

 

Open Display Size.

 

You’ll see a screen with a slider and a preview of what your Android phone’s interface will look like. Move the slider up until the preview suits your preference.

 

The new Display Size setting take effect immediately.

 

Android's Magnification feature, available through the Accessibility menu, also doesn't work with the default keyboard. If you activate it with the keyboard open, you can only magnify the portion of the screen where the keyboard isn't visible.

 

There is a downside to the Font Size setting; it changes the size of everything, not just the keyboard. That isn’t ideal if you only want a larger keyboard.

 
##   How Do I Enlarge My Keyboard?  
 

These steps will further increase the size of your Android keyboard but won't increase the size of the font. The results don’t improve readability but can make the keyboard easier to use for those who find the standard size cramped. It’s possible to reduce the size of the keyboard, as well.

 

Unlike the first method, this option only makes the default Android keyboard larger. It doesn’t change the rest of the interface.

 
- Open the Messages app.
 - Open any message.
 - Tap the Text Message field you'd normally use to send a message.
 - Tap the Gear icon that appears at the top of the Android keyboard.
 - Open Preferences.
 - Tap the Keyboard Height option. You'll see seven different options ranging from "Extra-short" to "Extra-tall." The default is "Normal." Tap the option you prefer. Your selection takes effect immediately.

 
##   More Ways to Resize Your Android Keyboard  
 

The methods above use the default settings options in Android to change the size of the keyboard. They’re the quickest, most straightforward way to resize the Android keyboard. However, these default methods won't satisfy everyone because they can impact how other elements of Android appear. They also don't offer much versatility.

 

Open the Messages app.

 

Open any message.

 

Tap the Text Message field you'd normally use to send a message.

 

Tap the Gear icon that appears at the top of the Android keyboard.

 

Open Preferences.

 

Tap the Keyboard Height option. You'll see seven different options ranging from "Extra-short" to "Extra-tall." The default is "Normal." Tap the option you prefer. Your selection takes effect immediately.

 

You can further customize the size of Android's keyboard by installing a third-party option. The best Android keyboards, like Swiftkey and MessagEase, offer alternatives that can not only resize the Android keyboard but entirely change the typing experience, offering better one-handed use or more aggressive predictive text.
