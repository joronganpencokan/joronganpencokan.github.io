# HBO Showdown: The Ultimate Battle Between HBO Now and HBO Max - Which Will Reign Supreme?

HBO has been the king of premium television for years, offering some of the most critically acclaimed shows of all time. With the launch of HBO Now in 2015, the network expanded their reach to cord-cutters and those without cable subscriptions, allowing viewers to access their content without a bulky cable package. 

Now, in May 2020, HBO has launched HBO Max, their newest streaming service. But with the success of HBO Now, many are wondering - what's the difference between the two platforms? And, more importantly, which will reign supreme?

## What is HBO Now?

HBO Now was a game-changer in the world of streaming television. It was the first time viewers could access HBO's content without a traditional cable subscription. With a simple payment of $15 a month, users could stream all of HBO's TV shows and movies on any device.

HBO Now has a vast library of original programming, including hits like "Game of Thrones," "Westworld," and "Veep." It also features popular movies, documentaries, and stand-up specials.

## What is HBO Max?

HBO Max is HBO's latest foray into the world of streaming TV. Along with all the content available on HBO Now, HBO Max also includes shows from other WarnerMedia properties, like DC Comics, Cartoon Network, and Turner Classic Movies.

HBO Max also has a slate of original programming, including "Love Life" starring Anna Kendrick and "HBO Max Originals," which includes shows like "Close Enough" and "The Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo." 

At $15 a month, HBO Max is more expensive than HBO Now. However, the company is betting on the strength of its brand and the massive library of content to justify the higher price.

## Which Streaming Service is Better?

The answer to this question ultimately comes down to what you're looking for in a streaming service. If you're an HBO fan through and through and only care about streaming their shows, HBO Now is a great choice. HBO Now has a vast library of original programming and is cheaper per month than HBO Max.

However, if you're a fan of WarnerMedia as a whole and are looking for a more robust library of shows and movies, HBO Max is the better choice. With a focus on content from WarnerMedia's vast network of properties, HBO Max offers more than just HBO's shows and movies.

In terms of original programming, both services have their strengths. HBO Now has classics like "Game of Thrones" and "Westworld," but HBO Max has a new slate of shows that will only be available on the platform.

Ultimately, the choice between HBO Now and HBO Max comes down to personal preference. If you're an HBO loyalist and only care about their shows and movies, HBO Now will suffice. But, if you're looking for a more diverse library of content and don't mind paying a little more, HBO Max is the way to go.

## Conclusion

HBO has long been the king of premium television, and with the launch of HBO Now and now HBO Max, the company is making significant strides in the streaming TV world. Both services offer a massive library of content, but HBO Max offers even more for a slightly higher price.

Ultimately, the choice between HBO Now and HBO Max comes down to personal preference. If you're a hardcore HBO fan, HBO Now is a great choice. But, if you're looking for a more extensive variety of content, HBO Max is the better choice. Regardless of which service you choose, you'll be getting access to some of the best television out there.
