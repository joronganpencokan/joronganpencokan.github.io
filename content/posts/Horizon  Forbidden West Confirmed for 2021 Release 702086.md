# Get Ready for the Ultimate Gaming Adventure: Horizon Forbidden West Officially Set to Release in 2021!

Gamers, rejoice! The highly anticipated continuation of one of the most beloved games of 2017 is officially set to arrive in 2021 – the Horizon Forbidden West. Developed by Guerrilla Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, this action-packed game is sure to surpass expectations and offer unparalleled gaming experiences.

With the trailer released in June 2020, fans have been eagerly waiting for this game to drop ever since. From stunning landscapes to terrifying beasts, the game's first look has left players in awe of its graphics and gameplay. The game is a continuation of Aloy's journey as the brave warrior ventures into the Forbidden West – a land ravaged by colossal storms, dangerous machines, and vicious tribes.

Horizon Forbidden West will offer hours of compelling gameplay, an immersive storyline, and modern mechanics that let players strategize and explore seamlessly. Players can expect to see more detailed landscapes, vibrant biomes, and even underwater exploration in the sequel. Additionally, the game features some new machines such as the mammoth-like Tremortusk and flying Sunwings.

Another exciting feature of Horizon Forbidden West is the freedom to experiment with skills and weapons. Players can explore a multitude of skills and machines that will aid them in their gameplay, such as using an explosive spear or a crossbow. The game offers a unique experience that allows players to modify and customize their gameplay according to their preferences.

The game's predecessor, Horizon Zero Dawn, received the Game of the Year award and was applauded by critics and fans alike for its stunning audio-visuals, immersive gameplay, and an intriguing storyline. However, judging from the trailer, Horizon Forbidden West is sure to top the charts and break barriers, just like Horizon Zero Dawn did.

Horizon Forbidden West has been in development for some time now, and players can expect the accumulation of efforts put forth by Guerrilla Games in the form of an epic game that takes players on a journey to the most beautiful and brutal places beyond their imagination.

The official release date for Horizon Forbidden West is yet to be announced, but sources state that the game will be available in 2021. The game will be available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, so players on both consoles can anticipate indulging in the most awaited game of the year.

In conclusion, the Horizon Forbidden West is set to offer a thrilling gaming experience that will leave players in awe of its graphics, storyline, and gameplay mechanics. Players can expect to see some new machines, weapons, and a vast open world that they can explore seamlessly. The game's high expectations can only mean one thing – it's going to be one of the greatest games of 2021!
