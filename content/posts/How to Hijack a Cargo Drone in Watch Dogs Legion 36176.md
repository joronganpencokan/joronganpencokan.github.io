Now that you have control over the cargo drone, it's time to put it to good use. The drone can be used to transport items or people from one point to another, provide aerial support during combat or use its powerful claws to remove obstacles or break through doors.

Step 5: Upgrade your cargo drone

As you progress through the game, you can find upgrades for your cargo drone, such as a stronger claw or an EMP device that can disable electronic systems. These upgrades, coupled with your skills, can make the cargo drone an invaluable tool in completing missions and moving around the city.
