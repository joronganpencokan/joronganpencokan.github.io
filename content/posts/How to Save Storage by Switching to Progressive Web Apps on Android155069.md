Are you fed up with running out of storage space on your Android device? It's a common issue that many users face, especially as smartphones become more advanced and capable of storing even more photos, videos, and apps.

But what if there was a simple storage hack that could save you GBs of space? More and more Android users are raving about a surprising solution: Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).

At its core, a PWA is a web application that looks and behaves just like a native app. PWAs can be accessed through a browser like any other website, but they can also be installed on your home screen like a regular app.

So how can PWAs help you save storage space? It's all about the way they are designed and developed.

Traditional native apps can take up a lot of storage space on your device because they need to download and store a significant amount of data and resources. This includes images, videos, and other content that you may not even access or need.

In contrast, PWAs are designed to be smaller and more efficient. They rely on web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a lightweight and streamlined experience. PWAs only download the data and resources that are necessary for the app to function, which can save you a significant amount of storage space.

For example, let's say you want to access your favorite online store on your Android device. Rather than downloading the native app, which could take up several hundred MBs of storage, you could simply access the PWA version of the store through your browser. The PWA may only be a fraction of the size of the native app, without sacrificing any of the functionality or features you need.

Another benefit of PWAs is that they don't require regular updates like native apps do. Because PWAs are accessed through a browser, any updates or changes to the app can be made on the server side without requiring you to download anything on your device. This can save you even more storage space over time.

So why haven't PWAs exploded in popularity yet? It's partly due to a lack of awareness and visibility. Many users may not even realize that PWAs exist, or they may assume that they are less capable or less reliable than native apps. However, as more developers create high-quality and feature-rich PWAs, it's likely that more and more users will discover the benefits of this storage-saving hack.

In conclusion, if you're tired of running out of storage space on your Android device, it's time to consider Progressive Web Apps. These web-based apps can save you GBs of space without sacrificing any of the functionality or features you need. With more and more developers embracing PWAs, it's only a matter of time before this surprising storage hack becomes mainstream.

Developers and companies have been aggressively pushing these technologies over native ones since the past year. That’s primarily because of their omnipresent characteristics, and as they run inside a browser, and developers don’t need to create separate apps for all the platforms. However, unlike before, web apps have come a long way, and you don’t have to compromise much in order to make the switch especially if you’re on Android.
Google has launched several new APIs through which developers can integrate these web views with the device’s core. Hence, you can monitor their usage through the phone’s settings, open in an entirely disparate window, multitask between them, work offline, access them through the launcher’s drawer like any other normal app, and receive local notifications. Titled “progressive web apps”, they’re currently in beta and are not available in the stable build of Google Chrome.
So, are they usable? In most cases, yes. I’ve been solely living with web apps for the last two weeks. Of course, not every app has a web equivalent, but in my experience, I was able to ditch most of my frequently used native apps including Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and more. And if you head into your phone’s settings, and check their size, it’s quite significant. For instance, Facebook’s official app and Messenger together consume over 500MB of your data, even more, if you have a ton of cache lying around. On the contrary, if you switch to Facebook’s web app, it will take around 100KB. That’s right, and you’ll only miss around 10% of features (such as live streaming), that too only if you’re an avid user. Furthermore, if you have a relatively underpowered smartphone that is struggling to keep up with your needs, web apps are a perfect getaway. They require negligible power and don’t bog down your phone in the background. You just need the browser, that’s it.


 
### How to Add a Progressive Web App


Okay, you’ve decided to decamp. Here’s how you can get started,

 





Update Google Chrome to version 57.
Small Clarification: The reason for preferring Chrome 57is because they support progressive web apps, hence if the developer has updated its site, the app will be installed just like every other native app. You can definitely use web apps through the older versions of Chrome app but the experience will be a bit incongruous. The selection of progressive web apps is quite limited right now but we expect other teams to follow soon.
Now, let’s add a web app. We’ll take Twitter for this demo. Load mobile.twitter.com on Chrome to get started.
Once opened, tap the three dots on the top right, and tap “add to the home screen”. Go through the installation process and you’re done!






 

You can check the data Twitter is accounting for in the settings and launch it from the app drawer.
In case the web app isn’t progressive, it will be added to the home screen like a web link but you can still use that. The first time you load it, say Facebook, you will also get an alert for enabling notifications, tap yes if you’d like to.
These are all the apps which are compatible with Google’s new guidelines. Some of the best ones include Flipkart, Telegram, Twitter, and Flipboard.



Google has been betting a lot of their efforts on web technologies such as their Chrome OS operating system. It will be interesting to see how the smartphone apps pan out in the future.
For now, this is all you need to know about switching to web apps, go on and save some storage and live in the browser. Do let us know in the comments section if we missed something or you’re stuck at a particular step.
