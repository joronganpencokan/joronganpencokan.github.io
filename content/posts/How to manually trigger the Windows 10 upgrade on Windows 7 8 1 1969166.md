# Unlock Hidden Windows 10 Upgrade Secret - Learn How to Manually Trigger the Upgrade on Windows 7 & 8.1!

Are you still running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1? Microsoft recently stopped providing support to these operating systems, which means they will no longer receive security updates and other crucial features. On top of that, some software developers are also moving away from creating applications that are compatible with older operating systems. This creates a problem for those who want to keep their old devices running smoothly.

The good news is, there's a way to manually trigger the upgrade to Windows 10. This hidden feature is specifically designed for those who are unable to upgrade their devices automatically. In this article, we'll take you through the process of unlocking the hidden Windows 10 upgrade secret.

## Step 1: Check Your Device Compatibility

Before we dive into the upgrade process, we need to make sure that your device is compatible with Windows 10. The minimum system requirements for Windows 10 are:

- Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or SoC
- RAM: 1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit
- Hard disk space: 16 GB for 32-bit OS or 20 GB for 64-bit OS
- Graphics card: DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver
- Display: 800x600

If your device meets these requirements, then you're ready to move on to the next step.

## Step 2: Download the Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant

To manually trigger the upgrade, you'll need to download the Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant. You can find this tool by searching "Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant" on Microsoft's official website or by clicking on the following link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10.

## Step 3: Run the Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant

Once you've downloaded the Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant, run the program by double-clicking on it. The tool will automatically check your device's compatibility with Windows 10 and download any necessary files.

## Step 4: Start the Upgrade Process

After the upgrade assistant has finished downloading the files, it will prompt you to confirm that you want to upgrade to Windows 10. Click on "Upgrade now" to begin the installation process. The tool will start installing Windows 10, and it may take some time to complete the process. Once the installation is done, you'll be prompted to restart your device.

## Step 5: Enjoy Windows 10!

Congratulations! You've successfully manually triggered the upgrade to Windows 10. Now you can enjoy the latest features and security updates offered by Microsoft's newest operating system.

## Conclusion

Upgrading your device from an older operating system to Windows 10 might seem daunting, but it's a necessary step to ensure the safety and longevity of your device.
