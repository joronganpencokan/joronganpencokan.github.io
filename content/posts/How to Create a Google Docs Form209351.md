# Unlock the Power of Google Docs: Discover the Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Your Own Interactive Forms Today!

Are you tired of the monotony of traditional forms and surveys? Do you want to create something more engaging that captures the attention of your audience? If so, then you should check out Google Docs' interactive forms feature. 

Google Docs is an online word processor that allows you to create and edit documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. One of its many features is interactive forms, which are questionnaires that allow users to respond to questions, provide feedback, or complete orders. 

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create your very own interactive forms using Google Docs:

### 1. Log in to Google Docs

Visit the Google Docs website and log in using your account credentials. If you don't have a Google account, you can create one for free.

### 2. Choose the Interactive Form Template

Once you're on the Google Docs homepage, click on the "Template Gallery" button, which is located on the top right corner of the screen. Then, select "Forms" to see the available interactive form templates. Choose one that suits your needs, or create one from scratch.

### 3. Customize the Form

With your chosen template open, you can now customize it to match your requirements. Add your questions, change the font style and size, or change the color of the background or text.

### 4. Create Response Options

After creating your questions, you'll need to create response options for users to choose from. These may include multiple choice, checkboxes, and more. Be sure to provide adequate response options to avoid limiting users' ability to answer accurately.

### 5. Test the Form

Once you are done creating the form, preview it to ensure everything looks and works as expected. Click the "Preview" button to see how your form will appear to users.

### 6. Share with Your Audience

After successfully previewing your form, you can share it with your intended audience. Click on the "Send" button to obtain a unique link that you can send via email, social media, or other channels.

### 7. Collect and Analyze Responses in Real-Time

After sending the form, sit back and wait for the responses to pour in. Google Docs will automatically collect and analyze these responses in real-time, making it easy for you to understand the feedback you receive.

In conclusion, Google Docs' interactive forms feature empowers you to create engaging questionnaires that collect valuable feedback from your audience. Whether you want to conduct customer satisfaction surveys, event registrations or employee evaluations, Google Docs' interactive forms feature simplifies the process, making it hassle-free for you. Give it a try today, and see the difference it makes to your form responses!

This article explains how to create a Google Docs form.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Visit docs.google.com/forms and select Blank or a template.From Docs, Sheets, or Slides: File > New > Form; from Sheets, Tools > Create a Form to link it to a spreadsheet automatically.Enter your questions and options.

 
##   Start a Google Form  
 

While it was once an option in Google Sheets, Forms is a separate tool now. You can access it inside Docs, Sheets, and Slides. The most popular way to use Forms is by creating a Google survey.

 
- At the top of each form are tabs for Questions and Responses. Go to the Questions tab, then give the form a name and description, or more likely, instructions about how to proceed. Responses are stored on the Responses tab, but you can also have responses automatically added to a spreadsheet.
 - On the Responses tab, you can turn off Accepting responses and add a message for users who attempt to fill out the form. You can also receive email notifications for new answers, download a CSV file, print, and delete all responses.
 - A few options allow you to customize the form with a theme color, background color, and font. You can also add images, hover text, and YouTube videos to this area. To access these settings, select the palette icon at the top of the page.
 - Next to the palette are preview and settings. You can preview the form and answer each question to make sure everything works correctly. Settings include whether to collect email addresses and if respondents can submit more than once, which you might want if you use the form to capture ideas, for example. You can also make the form a quiz that permits auto-grading if you add an answer key.

 
##   Google Form Response Format Options  
 

You can customize the format of responses you receive in many ways. A blank form contains one question, and you can add more by clicking the plus symbol on the right.

On the Responses tab, you can turn off Accepting responses and add a message for users who attempt to fill out the form. You can also receive email notifications for new answers, download a CSV file, print, and delete all responses. 

 

A few options allow you to customize the form with a theme color, background color, and font. You can also add images, hover text, and YouTube videos to this area. To access these settings, select the palette icon at the top of the page.

 

Next to the palette are preview and settings. You can preview the form and answer each question to make sure everything works correctly. Settings include whether to collect email addresses and if respondents can submit more than once, which you might want if you use the form to capture ideas, for example. You can also make the form a quiz that permits auto-grading if you add an answer key.

 

The default is multiple-choice, but there's also short answer, paragraph, check boxes, drop-down lists, scales, grids, date or time, and file upload. These options make Google Forms versatile. In addition to quizzes, you can use it for applications, homework submission, contests, and more.

 

Once you choose the answer type, you can further customize it, input multiple-choice or drop-down options, add other as an option, and enable or disable multiple answers. As you add more questions, you can duplicate your work if you plan to ask questions with similar choices. For example, "What is your favorite food?" followed by "What is your least favorite food?"

 

For all questions, you can decide whether an answer is required or not.

 
##   Add Sections to a Google Form  
 

For a contact form or short survey, one page is probably suitable. However, if you have a longer questionnaire, divide it into sections. That way, you won't overwhelm the recipients. Select the button on the right under the YouTube symbol to add a section. Each section can have a separate title and a description or instructions.

 

You can drag and drop questions between sections as needed as well as duplicate sections. Tap the three-dot menu in the upper-right corner, then select Duplicate Section. The menu includes options to move a section, delete a section, and merge with the section above.

 
##   Add Follow-Up Questions  
 

There are times when you might want to ask questions based on previous responses. For example, if you ask a true or false question and want an explanation when the respondent enters false. To do this, add a section with a multiple-choice or drop-down response. Tap the three-dot menu in the lower-right corner and select Go to section based on answer.

 

For each option, you can send the respondent to the next section or to any other section in the form, or skip to Submit form to end that respondent's participation.

 
##   Store Responses in Spreadsheet  
 

For all forms, you can store the answers in a Google spreadsheet so you can organize and manipulate the data. You can either create the form from Google Sheets, as described above, or link it to a spreadsheet in settings.

 
- From Sheets, go to Tools > Create a Form. Otherwise, go to the Responses tab of the form. Click the green icon on the right to open a spreadsheet. Then, either create a new spreadsheet or select an existing one.
 - Select Create or Select to proceed. By default, a new spreadsheet has a column for each question you created and a timestamp column that shows when the response was input. As you create more questions or edit existing ones, the spreadsheet updates.
 - If you linked the form to an existing spreadsheet, a response tab is added to it.

 
##   Share and Send the Form  
 

You can share Google Forms with others if it's a group effort. Select the three-dot-menu, choose Add Collaborators, then enter the email addresses or copy the sharing link.

 

From Sheets, go to Tools > Create a Form. Otherwise, go to the Responses tab of the form. Click the green icon on the right to open a spreadsheet. Then, either create a new spreadsheet or select an existing one.

 

Select Create or Select to proceed. By default, a new spreadsheet has a column for each question you created and a timestamp column that shows when the response was input. As you create more questions or edit existing ones, the spreadsheet updates.

 
If you linked the form to an existing spreadsheet, a response tab is added to it.
 

When the form is to your liking, check the settings before you send it. You can limit users to one response, allow them to edit their response after submitting it, link to the results if you're doing a poll, and change the confirmation message after someone submits their responses.

 

You can send and share a form with potential respondents in a variety of ways. Start by clicking Send at the top of the page.

 
- Send in an email: Click the envelope icon and enter the recipients' email addresses, a subject, and a message.Share the link: Click the link icon to copy the link to the form. You can also get a shortened form of the URL that starts with goo.gl/forms.Post it on social media: Click the Facebook or Twitter icon on the right.Embed it on a website: Click the greater than/less than symbols to copy the HTML code. You can also adjust the width and height of the form.

 
##   Build a Quiz With an Answer Key  
 

Google Forms are a useful tool for quizzes since you can input the correct answers and assign point values. Your students can get instant feedback, and you don't have to go through a stack of papers. Alternatively, you can delay sending out the results and reviewing any questions that don't have a definitive answer, such as one with a short answer or paragraph response format.

 

After you collect the responses, you can see the average and median grades. You can also view each question to see how many got it right vs. wrong.

 
You can edit a template as you would edit a blank form. It's just a starting point.
