Google Glass, the futuristic wearable device, has been a long-awaited technology since its announcement back in 2012. Its mind-blowing features, including its futuristic design, smart voice commands, and augmented reality tools, have intrigued tech enthusiasts globally.

The display sits on the frame's right-hand side, providing a clear view of the information displayed. The device's camera is situated above the display, capable of capturing photos with 5 MP and 720p videos at 30 frames per second. It also has a 12 GB Flash memory for storing media files.

The device's AR capability can also help users navigate their surroundings, identify objects, and translate signs in real-time.

We are getting closer to start seeing Google Glass everywhere, the company already made public Mirror, the Glass API, but what we didn’t officially know until now is the technical specs for the new gadget. According to Google, this is what customers will get for $1,500:
 
A 640 x 360 high-resolution display that “is the equivalent of a 25 inch screen from eight feet away”, a 5 megapixel camera capable of taking 720p videos. For audio, Google Glass is using bone conduction transducer. And a 16GB flash storage, however there will be only 12GB of usable memory, with sync capabilities to the cloud (e.g., Google Drive).
 
About battery, the company expects Glass to have a “full day of typical use”. But of course, if you plan to record a lot of videos and chat with your friends using Hangouts, the battery will not last as long.
 
It will also include Wi-Fi 802.11b/g, Bluetooth and it will come with its own Micro USB cable and charger. But the company warns that although the Micro USB is a standard cable, you should use the one that comes in the package to guarantee the lifespan of Google Glass.
 
Furthermore the Google Glass tech specs page also mentions a new companion app (compatible with Android 4.0.3 or higher) called MyGlass, which will also enable GPS and SMS messaging in your compatible phone.
