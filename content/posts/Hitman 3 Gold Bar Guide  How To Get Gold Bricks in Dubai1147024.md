# Uncover the Secret Formula to Score Gold Bars in Hitman 3's Dubai Mission - Get Rich Quick!


Hitman 3 has taken the gaming world by storm with its engaging plot and beautifully designed gameplay. Although the game offers multiple levels of difficulty, there is always one common goal - complete the mission and earn a high score. For players who always aim for the top score, the Dubai mission is the perfect place to start.

The Dubai mission is one of the most challenging missions in Hitman 3, requiring players to infiltrate the Burj Al-Ghazali - a high-end luxury hotel - and eliminate two high-value targets. To add to the challenge, players also need to uncover the hidden gold bars scattered throughout the hotel. The gold bars, although not mission-critical, can significantly enhance the score at the end of the mission.

Uncovering the gold bars in the Dubai mission isn't an easy task. The game creators have designed the hotel to be maze-like, filled with hidden rooms, security systems, and guards to protect the gold bars. However, with the right skills and strategy, players can uncover the secret formula to score gold bars in Hitman 3's Dubai mission and get rich quick!

### Step 1: Start with a Plan

Before entering the Dubai mission, it is essential to have a strategy in place. The Burj Al-Ghazali is a vast hotel, so it is crucial to know the location of the gold bars. Players should study the layout of the hotel and the security systems to identify potential escape routes.

### Step 2: Infiltrate the Hotel

The Dubai mission starts on top of the Burj Al-Ghazali. Players need to secure their position and navigate the level to gain access to the hotel. The first gold bar is located in the Southern Suite, accessible through the penthouse levels.

### Step 3: Befriend a Guard

In the Dubai mission, the guards play a vital role, and befriending one can be the key to success. Players can use their instinct power to see if a guard is vulnerable to compromise. They can then isolate the guard and take their outfit, granting access to restricted areas.

### Step 4: Stay Disguised

While wearing a guard uniform, players can move through the hotel without raising suspicion. However, if players engage in suspicious behavior or get caught on camera, they will lose their cover, and other guards will be on high alert.

### Step 5: Hacking Security Boxes

Throughout the Dubai mission, players will come across security boxes that can be hacked, providing access to hidden rooms and safes. The game also requires players to find codes for these boxes, which can be found on laptops or in notes.

### Step 6: Look Out for Hidden Rooms

The Burj Al-Ghazali contains various hidden rooms that can be found through hacked security boxes or locked doors. Players should always explore rooms for any valuable items, including additional gold bars.

### Step 7: Follow the Guards

The security in Burj Al-Ghazali is tight, and following a guard disguise allows for access to restricted areas. Players can use their instinct power to locate the nearest guard and blend in with their routine, moving unnoticed through the hotel.

### Step 8: Utilize Objects

Players can use objects in the environment to help with their mission. For example, throwing objects can distract guards or create a diversion, allowing players to gain access to restricted areas.

In conclusion, uncovering the secret formula to score gold bars in Hitman 3's Dubai mission is a challenging task. However, with the right skills, strategy, and patience, players can navigate the hotel, hack security boxes, and gain access to hidden rooms to find the hidden treasure. Following these steps will not only help players score gold bars in the Dubai mission, but also earn a high score, making it a lucrative and satisfying experience. So, get ready to infiltrate the Burj Al-Ghazali, and get rich quick!

Have you started playing Hitman 3? If YES then you must have noticed a Gold bar dispensing ATM machine in the lobby. Accessing the ATM Machine is quite easy but getting Gold bars in Hitman 3 is a bit complicated.
 

 
If you really want to have a lot of Gold bars in Hitman 3 then we have discovered a couple of ways that will help you out to accomplish your dream. Without any further ado, let’s go through both the methods one by one.
 
## Hitman 3: How to Get Gold Bricks in Dubai
 
### Method 1:
 
The first method requires players to replace the mission with a lock pick in their inventory as a gadget item. When you arrive in the lobby, head straight to the lockbox room, which is located beside the coat check. When you get there, you will find two separate banks of lockboxes that contain multiple items. You will find a gold bar in the banks of lockboxes located to the right of the entrance.
 
If you don’t have a lockpick in your inventory then you will have to use the second methods. It should be noted that the second way is a bit complicated than the first one.
 
### Method 2:
 
For the second method, you will need to head over to the server room, which you can find on the third floor of the building. After getting to the server room, go down the nearby balcony before taking down two maintenance staff members. To gain access to the server room, you will have to subdue the staff member who is not talking on the phone.
 
When you get back to the Server, a swipe card readers will appear and you will have to interact with it to sabotage a server terminal in the room. Notably, there are four server terminals in the room. Once you have sabotaged a server, you will be shown four options —  Re-arrange meetings, Open elevator doors, Disable cameras, and Deposit emergency funds.
 
You will have to select the ‘Deposit Emergency Funds’ option. After doing this, you will have to go back to the lobby and dispense Gold bars from the ATM Machine. Notably, you can dispense up to 19 gold bars from the machine.
 
Once you have added these gold bars to your inventory, players will be able to try the “cashing out” challenge which can only be done by hitting the Sheikh with a Gold bar.
 
That’s everything you need to know about how to Gold bars in Hitman 3. While here, ensure reading about how to get all Mastery Level rewards and how long to beat Hitman 3.
