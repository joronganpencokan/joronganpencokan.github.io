Unbelievable! Google Translate's Latest Update Will Revolutionize How You Travel Without the Internet

If you're a frequent traveler, you're likely familiar with the frustration of not being able to communicate with locals due to language barriers. While Google Translate has been a lifesaver for many in these situations, it still required an internet connection, which isn't always available when traveling.

But hold onto your hats, because Google Translate's latest update is about to change the game.

With the new update, Google Translate can now detect 59 languages offline, which means you can use it without an internet connection. Yes, you read that right. You can now communicate in a foreign language without having to rely on Wi-Fi, cellular data, or roaming charges.

The offline capability is made possible by Google's Neural Machine Translation technology, which is a fancy way of saying computer algorithms that can analyze and process vast amounts of language data. The result is a translation system that's more accurate and nuanced than previous versions, meaning fewer embarrassing mistranslations.

So, how does it work? Simply download the language pack you need from the Google Translate app while connected to the internet, and you're ready to go. It's currently available for Android and iOS devices.

So, what does this mean for travelers? It means you no longer have to worry about finding a Wi-Fi signal or mobile data plan when you're in a foreign country. It also means you can explore more off-the-beaten-path destinations, where internet access is limited or non-existent.

Of course, nothing beats face-to-face communication, but when that's not possible, being able to communicate through Google Translate can make a world of difference. It can help you navigate menus, give directions, negotiate prices, and even make new friends.

But it's not just travelers who will benefit from this update. Offline Google Translate can be a game-changer for people living in areas where internet access is limited, or for emergency situations when communication is critical.

In summary, Google Translate's latest update is a game-changer for anyone who needs to communicate in a foreign language without an internet connection. It's a real-life babel fish that will make traveling and everyday life a lot easier and more enjoyable. So, the next time you're planning a trip, be sure to download the relevant language packs in advance and enjoy the freedom of traveling without worrying about language barriers.

The world’s number one translation app, Google App, has added a new much awaited feature in its latest update in the Google Play Store. This latest update will enable users to save offline language packs so that translation is readily available. However, each language pack is over 100 mbs so make sure to free up some space if you want to save multiple  language packs. After updating your Google translate app, simply go to menu and chose offline languages and then download different languages from the list.

 - Web based translation have come a long way since the time they first appeared. At the very beginning, they would just translate text word by word, not regard any other aspects, this result in the translated text practically useless. Much of that has been changed with the emergence of the Google translation. It can now hand in pretty good translations of websites. But the web based translations still have some limitations. How should we decide whether we shall do the translation on the web or get a human translator involved? ..:
