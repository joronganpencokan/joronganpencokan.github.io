Accessing the Microsoft store is generally done on the Web, regardless of device, but installing Microsoft apps traditionally was done via the Microsoft store app on your computer. This, however, is no longer the case. With Microsoft including the feature to install apps remotely on the Web version of the Microsoft store, it has put on a new face.
 
This is more or less the equivalent of installing games on your Xbox when you are away. The criteria for this is to ensure your devices are connected to a Microsoft account. Then you can install apps on the store remotely on your Windows 10.
 
## Installing apps remotely on Windows 10
 
The first step is to visit the Windows App Store on your browser and to sign in. This does not have to be a browser on Windows OS. You just have to sign in with the same Microsoft account you use on your PC.
 
Once in the App Store, browse or search for the app you want.
 

 
You have the option to “Install” if you already have the app and “Get” if you do not yet have the app and need it added to your Microsoft account. Browsing on Windows 10, you will often see the menu (…) sign beside “Get.” Click on the menu sign. Note that clicking on “Get” will install the app only on the current device you are using while browsing.
 
On the window that appears next, select one or more devices you wish to install that app on and click “Install on my devices.”
 
Next, click “OK” and the app will automatically start downloading on the devices you have selected. The devices selected should be powered on and online at the time of performing this process. If not, the download will not start until the next time the devices are powered on and online.
 
Note that the download process will only be visible on the PC the download is meant for.
 
## Conclusion
 
Even though you can possibly access the Microsoft store on the Web, it used to be that you could only install apps through the Microsoft Store app on a computer. This new option Microsoft has added to remotely install apps on your devices has gone a long way in streamlining the app installation process and giving users more flexibility. As long as you use a uniform account across devices, each of your devices maintains the customized set of apps.
