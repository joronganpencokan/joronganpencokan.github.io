Title: You Won't Believe How This Feature Can Revolutionize Your Outlook Experience - Get Highlighted Emails Sent Only To You!

Are you tired of sifting through a sea of emails every day, trying to find the important ones amongst the clutter? Well, we have some exciting news for you - a feature in Microsoft Outlook that can revolutionize your email experience! It's called "highlighted emails," and it's designed to make your inbox more manageable and efficient.

With highlighted emails, you can set up specific rules that highlight certain emails that are relevant to you. This means that important messages will be easily visible, making sure that you never miss out on important information. In order to set up highlighted emails, follow these simple steps:

Step 1: Open Outlook and select the "Home" tab.

Step 2: Click on the "Rules" button, then select "Manage Rules & Alerts."

Step 3: Click on the "New Rule" button, then select "Apply rule on messages I receive."

Step 4: Choose the conditions that you want to apply to your highlighted emails. For example, you can choose to highlight emails that are sent from a particular sender or emails that contain specific keywords in the subject line.

Step 5: Choose the actions that you want to apply to your highlighted emails. For example, you can choose to highlight the email in a particular color or move it to a separate folder.

Step 6: Click "OK" to create your rule.

That's it! Now, whenever an email meets your highlighted email conditions, it will be highlighted in your inbox. You'll be able to quickly identify these emails and take appropriate action. This feature is especially useful for people who receive a lot of emails and need to prioritize their inbox.

But that's not all - with highlighted emails, you can also choose to receive only highlighted emails from certain people. This means that you can create a rule that ensures that you only receive emails from certain people that meet your highlighted email conditions. For example, you can create a rule that ensures you only receive emails about a particular project from your manager. This is a fantastic way to ensure that you don't miss any important updates.

In conclusion, highlighted emails are a game-changer when it comes to managing your inbox. By organizing your inbox, you'll be able to save time and focus on the important things. If you're not using highlighted emails already, we highly recommend that you give it a try - you won't believe the difference it can make!
