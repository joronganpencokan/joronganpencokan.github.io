While rooting any recent Samsung device is relatively easy, it comes with a catch: the warranty of the device will be voided.
Other OEMs like HTC also give owners of their handsets a warning when they unlock the bootloader of their handset that the warranty of their device will be voided. However, if a user relocks the bootloader, there is no way for HTC or any other OEM to know that the device was actually tampered with.
On recent Samsung devices though, including the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge, rooting the handset will trip KNOX — Samsung’s enterprise security solution — to ‘0x1 ‘. This signifies that the handset has been tampered with and its warranty will be voided. There is no way to reset the KNOX counter to 0 since it is apparently a physical switch inside the device that trips when the system partition on any recent Samsung device is modified.
Thankfully for Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge owners, developer idler1984 has found an exploit that makes it possible to gain root access on the handset without tripping KNOX. You can find a list of all the compatible firmware here. If your Galaxy S6 or S6 edge is running any of the firmware mentioned in the list, you can easily use PingPongRoot to gain root access on it.
PingPongRoot also works with AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile variants of the Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 edge, which ship with a locked down bootloader.
The steps to use PingPongRoot can be found below.
Step 1: Download the PingPongRoot ZIP file and extract the the APK file inside it. Then transfer the APK to the internal storage of your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 edge.
Step 2: Using a file manager like Solid Explorer or ES File Explorer,  navigate to the folder where you had transferred the APK. Tap on its name and install it just like any other APK.
Step 3: Open the ‘PingPong Root’ app from the app drawer and tap on the ‘Get root!’ button.

Step 4: Once the app has done its job, it will prompt you to reboot your handset. Now, simply restart the device to enjoy root access on your Galaxy S6.
PingPong Root uses Kinguser as the default app to manage root permissions for different apps. While there is a way to replace Kinguser with SuperSU, the method requires the use of ADB, which is complicated for the average user. Thankfully though, the developer of PingPong Root is working on a new version of the app that will feature SuperSU as the default root permission manager app instead of Kinguser.
