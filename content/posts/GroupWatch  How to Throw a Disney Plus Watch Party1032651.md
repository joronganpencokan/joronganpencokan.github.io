Introduction
Movie nights have always been a fun way to spend time with friends and family. Whether it's enjoying a classic Disney movie or discovering the latest blockbuster, there's no denying the joy of watching a film together. However, with the ongoing pandemic, gathering for movie nights might not be possible for everyone. But, there's no need to worry because Disney+ has introduced a new feature called GroupWatch, which allows you to watch movies together with your friends and family virtually. In this article, we'll take a closer look at how this feature works and how you can become the ultimate host of Disney Plus watch parties.

What is GroupWatch?
GroupWatch is a new feature introduced by Disney+ that allows you to watch movies and TV shows together with up to six people who are located in different households. Once you start a GroupWatch session, you can invite your friends and family to join in by sharing a link. Everyone who joins can control the playback, pause, rewind, or fast-forward the movie. And the best part? There's a real-time chat feature that allows you to interact with one another, making it feel like you are watching the movie together in person.

How to Start a GroupWatch
To start a GroupWatch, the first step is to ensure that you have a Disney+ subscription. Once you have that, follow these simple steps:

1. Open the Disney+ app on your phone or tablet.
2. Select the movie or TV show you want to watch.
3. Tap on the icon located at the bottom-right corner of the screen.
4. Select 'GroupWatch' from the options displayed.
5. Invite up to six people by sharing the link provided.

Tips for Becoming the Ultimate Host of Disney Plus Watch Parties
1. Plan in Advance: Decide on a date and time for the watch party and ensure that everyone is available and prepared to join. Make sure you have everything you need, such as snacks and drinks, ready in advance.

2. Select the Right Movie: When choosing a movie, consider the preferences of the people you've invited to the GroupWatch. Since everyone is joining virtually, you want to select a movie that everyone can enjoy.

3. Use the Chat Feature: Take advantage of the chat feature on GroupWatch to communicate with everyone during the movie. Encourage your guests to share their thoughts and engage in conversation about the movie.

4. Make it Fun: After the movie, have a discussion or trivia session about the movie. You could even consider giving out prizes for the person who answers the most questions correctly.

Conclusion
While it might not be possible to enjoy movie nights in person at the moment, the GroupWatch feature on Disney+ has made it possible for friends and family to come together virtually and enjoy movies together. Become the ultimate host of Disney Plus watch parties by following our tips and tricks. Plan in advance, select the right movie, use the chat feature, and make it fun.

##   How to Host a Disney Plus Watch Party  
 

Here's how to watch Disney Plus with friends in just a few short taps or clicks.

 
- Login to Disney Plus on your respective device. If you're doing so on a browser, go to the Disney+ site.
 - Select the film or TV show that you want to watch with your friends and family.
 - Select the small GroupWatch icon—it looks like three amorphous cartoon people.
 - On the GroupWatch screen, select the + icon next to your profile picture. You'll then be given a link that, when shared with others, allows them to join your GroupWatch session.
 - Select Copy Link and share the link with friends and family however you see fit. A GroupWatch party can have up to 7 people, including the host. When they join your watch party you'll see the group number in the top-right of the screen increase, as well as have the option of who's there by selecting that number.

 
##   Join and Watch Disney Plus in a Party  
 

Joining a GroupWatch party is even easier than hosting it. All you need to do is make sure you have Disney Plus account, and if you're on a mobile device or console, have the app installed. If you're on a PC, you can instead use the browser to GroupWatch with your friends and family.

 
If you are using a smart TV or a streaming box like an Apple TV, you won't be able to initiate the GroupWatch. You can still participate, but the other party you're watching with has to use a web browser or a mobile app to initiate the GroupWatch.
 

Login to Disney Plus on your respective device. If you're doing so on a browser, go to the Disney+ site.

 

Select the film or TV show that you want to watch with your friends and family.

 

Select the small GroupWatch icon—it looks like three amorphous cartoon people.

 

On the GroupWatch screen, select the + icon next to your profile picture. You'll then be given a link that, when shared with others, allows them to join your GroupWatch session.

 

Select Copy Link and share the link with friends and family however you see fit. A GroupWatch party can have up to 7 people, including the host. When they join your watch party you'll see the group number in the top-right of the screen increase, as well as have the option of who's there by selecting that number.

 

When your watch party host sends you a link, select it and it should either open the app or send you to the Disney Plus homepage in your browser.

 

Login and you should immediately be taken into the GroupWatch Party. See who else is there by selecting the viewer icon in the top-right.

 
##   How Disney+ Watch Party (GroupWatch) Works  
 

As host, you can invite up to six other watchers. Disney Plus allows up to four profiles on an account to stream together.

 

You'll all watch the movie or TV show at the same time, with the option to pause, rewind, or replay together to better share your favorite moments. You can even use emojis to interact while you watch.

 

This is a little different to sharing a Disney Plus account, where you both use the same login details. You'll both need to your own accounts to watch the same content together at the same time and to enjoy all the additional interactive elements of Disney GroupWatch parties.

 
##   Can Anyone Host a Disney Plus Watch Party?  
 

As inclusive as Disney Plus watch parties are, they aren't something everyone can host or partake in. Currently, the GroupWatch feature is only available in the U.S., and children's profiles cannot take part in them at all.

 

If you have multiple people in the same home or watch to take part in a watch party together, they'll need to use the same device to do so. While there is a four device limit per Disney Plus account, GroupWatch events limit GroupWatch members to one device per account, though you can do so on any compatible laptop, desktop, tablet, phone, or console.
