In addition to Office 365 and Office 2019, Microsoft also provides a free version of the apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, Calendar, People, and OneDrive), but these are web versions of the apps, which you can only use on a web browser with an internet connection.
 
However, if you don’t have a subscription to use the desktop version of the Office apps, and you prefer a more classic experience, you can use Google Chrome to install the apps on Windows 10 as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). This is similar to installing web apps with Microsoft Edge Chromium, but without the same level of integration, as using Edge, apps will register in the Start menu, and you get the ability to uninstall web apps just like regular apps from the Settings app.
 
Progressive Web Apps is a technology that allows websites to deliver an app-like experience to the end-user, such as the ability to work offline, notifications, automatic updates, easy installation and uninstallation, and various other features. However, it’s up to the developer to implement these functionalities.
 
In this guide, you’ll learn the steps to install the web version of Office apps as regular desktop applications on Windows 10.
