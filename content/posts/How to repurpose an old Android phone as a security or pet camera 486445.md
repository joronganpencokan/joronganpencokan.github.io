Transform Your Old Android Phone into a Next-Level Security and Pet Monitoring Device with These Easy Steps!

Are you tired of letting your old Android phone collect dust in a drawer? Instead of letting it go to waste, why not turn it into a next-level security and pet monitoring device? With a few easy steps, you can transform your old phone into a useful tool for keeping your home and pets safe.

Step 1: Download a Home Security App

There are many home security apps available that can turn your old phone into a surveillance camera. Some popular options include Alfred, Salient Eye, and AtHome Camera. These apps use your phone's camera to monitor your home and alert you if any movement is detected. You can set up multiple cameras around your home and access the live feed anytime from your current phone.

Step 2: Set Up Your Camera

Once you've downloaded a security app, set up your camera in a strategic location in your home. For example, you may want to place it near your front door or in your pet's favorite room. Make sure the camera is stable by using a tripod or setting it on a flat surface. You can also use a mount to secure your phone to a wall or ceiling.

Step 3: Connect to Wi-Fi

To use your old phone as a surveillance camera, it will need to be connected to Wi-Fi. Make sure the phone is connected to your home network and that it has a strong signal. You can also use mobile data if you don't have access to Wi-Fi.

Step 4: Monitor Your Home and Pets

With your camera set up and connected to Wi-Fi, you can now monitor your home and pets from your current phone. Depending on the app you're using, you may receive notifications if any movement is detected. You can also access the live feed anytime from your phone and check in on your home and pets when you're away.

Transforming your old Android phone into a next-level security and pet monitoring device is a great way to repurpose an outdated device. Instead of letting it go to waste, use it to keep your home and pets safe. With just a few easy steps, you'll have a reliable surveillance camera that you can access anytime from your current phone.

As they say, necessity is the mother of invention. To be able to keep watch over him, and still meet deadlines, I decided to make use of one of the many Android phones I had lying around. With the help of a simple-to-use application, called DroidCam. This app makes it remarkably easy to create a security or webcam that can be used for many applications (security, monitoring, etc.). Let me show you how this is done.

 
## Requirements


To make this work you will need the following:

 
An Android phone (running version 5.0 and up).A power cord for the phone (you don't want your battery to run out).The DroidCam app.A web browser on the same network as the phone.


With those things at the ready, let's get this up and running.

 
## How to use an old Android phone as a security or pet camera
 
### Step 1: Installing DroidCam


Installing the application is simple with these steps:

 
Open the Play Store on your Android device.Search for DroidCam.Tap Install.


Once the app is installed, you're ready to go.

 
### How to use DroidCam


Make sure your Android device is on the same wireless network as the desktop or laptop you'll use to view the camera and start the application. Once it starts (Figure 1), it will present you with the address you use to connect from your browser.
Figure 1
The output on the screen displays the IP address and the port you need to use to access the camera. If you point a web browser to http://SERVER:4747/video (Where SERVER is the IP address displayed by DroidCam), you'll see the video output from the camera (Figure 2).
Figure 2
The free version of the app only offers 240p or 480p resolutions. To get 720p and 1080p resolutions you must purchase the pro version of the app (DroidCamX $5.49 on the Google Play Store), which adds sound, HD mode, and SmoothFPS for more stable video. However, for very basic security/baby/cat cam usage, the free version does just fine.
Remember to plug that phone into an outlet, as streaming video can eat away at the battery. The good news on that front is that the app will continue streaming, even after your phone is locked and asleep.Â 
That's the gist of using DroidCam as a web/security cam. I've used this setup for a few applications, where I needed more eyes than evolution gave me.
