Secret Revealed: The Ultimate Guide To Marry Into Royalty In Bitlife - Discover The Countries With Monarchy That Guarantee Your Royal Wedding!

Have you ever dreamt of marrying into royalty? Of living a life of luxury, attended to by servants and with your every desire catered to? Bitlife, the popular life simulation app, now offers the chance to do just that! But what countries guarantee your royal wedding?

In Bitlife, you can choose to be born into any country in the world. However, if you want to marry into royalty, you need to select a country with a monarchy. There are currently 27 countries worldwide with a monarchy, as recognized by the United Nations. However, some are better than others when it comes to marrying into royalty.

Let’s start with the UK. Thanks to the enduring popularity of the British Royal Family, marrying into it is a dream for millions of people worldwide. In Bitlife, this is actually achievable. If you want to marry into the British Royal Family, you need to become a British citizen first. This means being born in the UK, or emigrating there and living there for a set number of years. Once you’re a citizen, your chance of meeting a member of the Royal Family is random. However, you can increase your chances by attending events like the Royal Ascot or Wimbledon, or by going on vacations to places like the Caribbean.

Another country with a popular monarchy is Spain. The Spanish Royal Family has been in the spotlight in recent years, thanks to the scandals surrounding King Felipe VI’s father, Juan Carlos I. However, the possibility of marrying into the Spanish monarchy is still a dream for many. In Bitlife, you need to be born in Spain or emigrate there and become a citizen to have a chance of meeting a member of the Spanish Royal Family. You can increase your chances by attending events like bullfights or visiting popular tourist destinations like Palma de Mallorca.

One final country to consider when it comes to marrying into royalty is the tiny European nation of Liechtenstein. Although it is little known outside Europe, Liechtenstein has its own monarchy that is steeped in tradition. It is also a tax haven, making it a popular destination for wealthy ex-pats. In Bitlife, you need to be born in Liechtenstein or emigrate there and become a citizen to have a chance of meeting a member of the princely family. You can increase your chances by attending local festivals and events.

In conclusion, if you’re looking to marry into royalty in Bitlife, your best bet is to select a country with a popular monarchy. The United Kingdom, Spain and Liechtenstein are all great options. However, the chances of meeting a member of the royal family are still slim. Good luck!
