# Unleash Destruction like a Viking God: Learn How to Obliterate the Green Metal in Nidavellir in Gow Ragnarok!

Nidavellir, the land of the dwarves, has long been known for its priceless metals and legendary craftsmanship. One of the most sought-after substances in this realm is the Green Metal, a material with unparalleled strength and durability that can only be found in Nidavellir.

In the latest God of War installment, God of War: Ragnarok, players can take on the mantle of Kratos once again and explore the Nine Realms, including Nidavellir, to unleash their full destructive potential. In this guide, we will show you how to obliterate the Green Metal in Nidavellir and claim it as your own.

## Equip Kratos with the right gear

The first step in taking down the Green Metal is to make sure that Kratos is equipped with the right gear. In God of War: Ragnarok, Kratos can acquire various weapons and armor sets, each with its unique strengths and abilities. One such set that can aid you in your quest is the Armor of the Ancients.

This armor set offers increased damage against enemies and grants protection against poison and burn damage. It also boosts Kratos' runic attacks, which are crucial in opening up the Green Metal's weak points.

Additionally, upgrading Kratos' runic attacks, talismans, and enchantments can significantly increase his damage output and survivability in battles against the dwarves and their machines.

## Learn the Green Metal's weaknesses

The Green Metal is notoriously tough, but it has weaknesses that can be exploited. One of these weaknesses is its susceptibility to runic attacks. Kratos can use precision strikes to hit the metal's weak points and deal massive damage.

Another weakness is its vulnerability to frost damage. Using frost-based runic attacks, Kratos can inflict heavy damage on the dwarves and their machines, making it easier to break their defenses and destroy them.

## Utilize Atreus and his abilities

Atreus, Kratos' son, is a valuable ally in battles against the dwarves and their machines. His bow and arrows can deal significant damage from afar, allowing Kratos to stay clear of their attacks and focus on striking the Green Metal's weak points.

Atreus also has various abilities that can aid in battle. For instance, his Shock Arrow can stun enemies, giving Kratos an opening to unleash his runic attacks. His Summon Wolf ability can summon a pack of wolves to attack enemies, providing Kratos with much-needed backup in tough battles.

## Conclusion

In summary, taking down the Green Metal in Nidavellir requires strategy, skill, and the right gear. By equipping Kratos with the right weapons and armor, learning the metal's weaknesses, and utilizing Atreus' abilities, players can unleash their full destructive potential and claim this valuable substance as their own.

Whether you are a seasoned God of War veteran or a new player to the franchise, honing your skills and perfecting your battle tactics against the dwarves and their machines is crucial in winning battles and overcoming challenges in God of War: Ragnarok. So get out there, unleash destruction like a Viking god, and claim the Green Metal for yourself!
