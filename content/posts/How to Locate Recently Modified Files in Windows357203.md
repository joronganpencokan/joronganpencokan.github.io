Title: Unlock the Secrets of Your Windows PC with This Genius Hack for Finding Recently Modified Files!

Have you ever lost track of a file or document on your Windows PC that you knew you had recently modified or opened? It can be a frustrating and time-consuming task to search through hundreds or even thousands of files to find the one you need. But don't worry, we have a genius hack that will help you unlock the secrets of your Windows PC and easily find the recently modified files you're looking for.

Using a Windows feature called “Date Modified,” you can quickly and easily find the files you’ve worked on most recently. By sorting files by their modified date, you can easily see which files have been updated recently, even if the file name is not immediately clear.

So, how do you use this feature? It’s simple!

First, open File Explorer by clicking on the folder icon in your taskbar, or by pressing the Windows key and E at the same time.

Next, navigate to the folder where you believe the recently modified file might be. This could be your Documents folder, Downloads folder, or even a specific folder for a particular project you’re working on.

Once you’re in the folder, click on the View tab at the top of the window, and then click on the dropdown arrow next to “Sort by.” Here, you’ll see a set of options for how to sort your files, including “Name,” “Date Modified,” “Type,” and others.

Click on “Date Modified” to sort your files by the date they were last modified. You can choose to sort them in ascending or descending order, depending on whether you want to see the oldest or newest files first.

Once you’ve sorted your files by date modified, you’ll be able to quickly see which files were changed most recently. This is especially useful when you’re working on a project with multiple files, and you need to find the specific file you were last working on.

But the Date Modified feature doesn’t just help you find recently modified files – it can also help you clean up your PC and free up space. By sorting files by their modified date, you can easily identify files that haven’t been touched in months or even years. These files may be old backups, outdated documents, or just files you no longer need. With this information, you can confidently delete these files to free up space on your hard drive.

In conclusion, using the “Date Modified” feature in Windows can be a lifesaver when you need to find a recently modified file or clean up your PC. With just a few clicks, you can sort your files based on the date they were last modified and quickly identify the files you need. This hack is a simple but powerful way to unlock the secrets of your Windows PC and make it work for you. Give it a try the next time you’re searching for a file, and see how much time and frustration it can save you!

In Windows you can easily find files by typing some or their entire name in the search box. However, if you forgot the name of the file entirely but remember that it was modified recently (like last week), you would be able to find it by launching a search for recently modified files.
 
The following will show you how you can search for files this way.
 

 
## File Time Stamps: What are they and why are they so important?
 
Time stamps are records of the time when files were created, accessed, and modified. Windows records a time stamp in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) format which prevents it from being affected by shift in time zone as well as Daylight Savings Time (DST). Windows saves time stamps in a machine language which would be difficult for the users to interpret. Its simplification is performed by Windows System Call, wherein information like seconds, minutes, hour, day, month, and year is extracted and presented in an easy-to-understand way.
 
The importance of time stamps is heightened when you need to look for files based on them. Time stamps on Windows are divided into three areas.
 
Date created: It shows the time and date when the file was first created, meaning first saved by the user. This value cannot be changed without the help of a third party application.
 
Date Modified: Whenever you modify anything in the file (document, presentation, etc.), Windows records a time stamp. Note that if you rename the file or open it, it will not change the time stamp. Only when you make a modification inside it does it record a time stamp.
 
Date Accessed: This is the date and time when the file was last opened. Windows will give a time stamp for accessing the file even when you just opened it, read it, and closed it back again.
 
There are wo ways of searching recently modified files: File Explorer and Windows Search
 
## Through File Explorer (when you know where you saved the file)
 
1. Open File Explorer and reach the folder where you saved the file.
 
2. Beside the Name column, locate the Date modified column.
 
3. In order to see Date Created and Date Accessed, right click Date Modified and select More.
 
4. Check the boxes against Date Created and Date Accessed. You may need to scroll down a bit for locating the two options. When done, click OK.
 
5. You should now see two columns: Date Created and Date Accessed
 
Click on Date Modified to activate it so that it shows the most recently modified files first.
 
## Through Windows Search (when you can’t remember where you saved the file)
 
1. Open “This PC” file explorer
 
2. Click the Search box and mention datemodified: (without space).
 
3. A new box labeled “Select a date or date range” will pop up.
 
4. You will see a calendar with today’s date highlighted. Below it, there are Calendar Presets. Using the presets, you could search for the file.
 
5. Since the file was modified not any earlier than last week, you could either click the preset labeled Last Week or write in the search box ‘last week:’ You will immediately see the results, and the file you are looking for would be one of them.
 
Now, with this info you can easily locate your files and recover them if necessary. Just remember how to use one of the above methods.
