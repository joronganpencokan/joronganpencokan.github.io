# Secret Revealed: How to Leave a Guild in Lost Ark and Avoid Disaster in 5 Easy Steps!

Are you tired of being a part of a guild that doesn't align with your gameplay style or goals? Do you feel like you're stuck with a team that's not meeting your needs? Fear not, because leaving a guild in Lost Ark is easy and can be done in just five simple steps! Here's how you can do it without any trouble.

## Step 1: Find a New Guild

Before you leave your current guild, it's essential to find a better one that aligns with your gameplay style and goals. Look for guilds that have similar level players as yourself or those engaged in the same activities. You can do this by using the guild search feature, where you can browse through different guilds, their descriptions, their rules and criteria for being a member, and also finding a starting zone or location that fits your playtime.

## Step 2: Notify Guild Leaders

After you have found a new guild, it's essential to notify your current guild leaders with your intention of leaving. You can do this by messaging them directly and expressing your reasons for leaving. It's not mandatory to do this, but it's courteous; especially, if you have made friends in the guild or if the guild has rules that require you to notify them when leaving.

## Step 3: Process of Exiting the Guild

Depending on the guild leaders' rules, they may need to accept your exit request after you've notified them. If not, you can leave the guild by going to the Guild Menu and click on the "Leave Guild" option. It may take a while to process, but it's a quick and easy way to get out.

## Step 4: Exit All Contents

Make sure to take out anything that you've borrowed or taken out of the guild's shared resources, such as money, items, or crafting materials. Check the guild bank and make sure to return anything that isn't yours. This ensures that you don't disrupt the guild's resources when you leave.

## Step 5: Move on to a New Journey

Now that you've officially left your old guild and taken care of everything, you are now free to join a new guild and continue your journey in the game. With new comrades and friends, you'll be able to explore new opportunities within the game and maybe even find yourself on the leaderboard.

In conclusion, leaving a guild in Lost Ark can be a simple and easy task if done correctly, and following these steps will ensure that you won't cause chaos and other complications when exiting your current guild. Best of luck in your new guild and adventures ahead!
