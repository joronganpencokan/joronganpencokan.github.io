First, let's talk about what a lingering potion is. A lingering potion is a type of potion that can be thrown onto the ground and creates a cloud of magical particles that persist for some time. Enemies that come into contact with this cloud will be affected by the potion.

Now, let's get to the recipe for the ultimate lingering potion. You will need to gather the following ingredients:

- Dragon's Breath
- Gunpowder
- Redstone Dust
- Fermented Spider Eye
- Glowstone Dust

Once you have all these ingredients, craft a Lingering Potion base by combining Awkward Potion (water bottle + Nether Wart) with a Dragon's Breath in a brewing stand. This will give you a Lingering Potion of Dragon's Breath.

Next, add the Gunpowder to create the area effect. The Redstone Dust will increase the duration of the potion. The Fermented Spider Eye is added to make the potion harmful to enemies. Finally, Glowstone Dust will increase the potency of the potion.

Congratulations, you have now created the ultimate Lingering Potion!

Now, let's talk about some practical applications of this potion. One great use of this potion is in PvP battles. Throw it at your enemies and watch as they get affected by the potion, giving you an advantage in the battle. Another use is in mob farms where you can throw the potion inside the spawning area and wait for the mobs to come to you. It's also great for clearing out an area of mobs quickly.

##   What Does a Lingering Potion Do in Minecraft?  
 

When you use a Lingering Potion, it creates a cloud on the ground that grants a status effect to anyone who steps inside. The cloud will last for 30 seconds, slowly shrinking until it disappears.

 

The effects of Lingering Potions are diluted compared to other variants. A Lingering Potion of Healing, for instance, will restore half the amount of health as a regular or Potion of Healing. That said, the effect stacks if you stay inside the cloud, so you can easily replenish all of your health.

 

How to use a potion in Minecraft depends on which platform you're playing on:

 
- PC: Right-click and holdMobile: Tap and holdXbox: Press and hold LTPlayStation: Press and hold L2Nintendo: Press and hold ZL

Some arrows, like the Arrows of Luck, are not available in every version of the game.
