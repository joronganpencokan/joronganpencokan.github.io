Revolutionary Method Revealed: Move Your Whatsapp to SD Card and Save Space in 2023!

If you are someone who struggles with managing the storage space on their phone, then here's some good news for you! The year 2023 might just be the year you finally get the reprieve you've been waiting for – and it all has to do with Whatsapp.

The messaging app, used by billions of people around the world, has long been known for its uncanny ability to consume unreasonable amounts of storage space on your device. Whether it's the endless stream of photos, videos, and audio files that you exchange with your contacts, or the constant updates that the app requires, space constraints have always been a major headache for Whatsapp users.

But now, there's a revolutionary new method that promises to solve this problem once and for all. By moving your Whatsapp app from the internal memory of your phone to an SD card, you can free up precious storage space without having to delete any of your important messages or media files.

The process is not only simple but also completely safe, and can easily be done with just a few taps on your screen. First, you need to ensure that your phone has an SD card slot, which is present in most Android phones that were released in the past few years. If your phone does not have one, then you will have to get one before you proceed with the following steps.

Step 1: Go to your phone's Settings and select the 'Apps' option.

Step 2: Scroll down and find the Whatsapp app on the list of installed apps. Tap on it.

Step 3: Once you're inside the Whatsapp app settings, you will see an option called 'Storage.' Tap on it.

Step 4: Here, you will see two options – 'Clear data' and 'Move to SD card.' Tap on the latter.

Step 5: The app will now start moving all its data to your SD card. Depending on the amount of data you have on Whatsapp, this process could take a few minutes to complete.

And there you have it – your Whatsapp app is now stored on your SD card, and you can reclaim all the storage space it was taking up on your phone's internal memory.

However, it's worth noting that this method may not work for everyone. There have been reports of some phones being unable to move Whatsapp to their SD cards due to compatibility issues, so it's best to check with your phone's manufacturer before you attempt this method.

As the world becomes increasingly dependent on technology, managing storage space on our devices is becoming more important than ever. With this revolutionary new method, Whatsapp users can finally breathe a sigh of relief and enjoy their app without having to worry about storage constraints.

So if you're someone who's been struggling with storage space on your phone, now is the perfect time to move your Whatsapp to your SD card. It's a simple yet effective way to save space, and one that you'll be grateful for in the long run.

You can’t transfer WhatsApp to your SD card but you can transfer its folders (eg. media and backups) to free up your phone’s internal storage. You can do this by going into your WhatsApp folder, selecting the folders you want to transfer then move them to your phone’s SD card.
 
If you’re like me, you undoubtedly use WhatsApp every day. You share memes, cute pictures, funny videos, and sometimes embarrassingly long voice notes. All of this is great until you get that “low on storage” notification. That leaves you wondering “how do I free up space?” The solution is quite simple – move WhatsApp to SD card. 
 
Here’s how to do it and free up some much-needed space on your Android device.
 
## Moving WhatsApp To SD Card 
 
### Using An Android Phone’s File Explorer
 
One of the best ways to move all WhatsApp media to your SD card is by using your phone’s file manager. This means you don’t have to download any additional apps or connect your phone to your computer. 
 
- Find and open the file explorer app on your Android phone. Depending on your phone, the app will be called either My Files/Files/File Explorer.When you open your file explorer, there will be two storage options, Internal Storage (sometimes called Device Storage) and External Storage (also known as SD card). You’re going to access the internal storage because that’s where WhatsApp data is stored.Once you’ve accessed your device’s internal storage, scroll until you find the Whatsapp folder and open it.After you’ve opened the WhatsApp folder, scroll until you see the “Media” folder and select it. The Media folder will contain all of the media files you’ve sent and received on WhatsApp, including Status Updates (though these are deleted after 24 hours).Select the “More” option on the top right-hand corner of your phone. This may show itself as three vertical dots, depending on your device and Android OS.After you’ve tapped on the “More” option, a pop-up menu will appear. Select the “Move” option on this menu.Selecting “Move” will bring up options for where you can transfer the Media folder. Choose SD card to transfer the Media folder to the SD card.Following this step, click “Done.” This will begin transferring all of your media files from your Internal Storage to your SD card.

 
### Using A Computer 
 
Another great way to transfer Whatsapp to SD card is by using your computer. This guide will explain how to do this using a Windows PC, but you can also use a Mac or Chromebook to do the transfer, as well. 
 
- Connect your phone/tablet to your computer using your USB cord.Click on This PC to find your Phone. In this case, I’m using Galaxy Tab A, so I clicked on that device.Clicking on your device will open it and show you the Internal Storage and SD Card options. Click Internal Storage to open it.Scroll until you find the Whatsapp folder. Once you’ve found it, click to open it.After you’ve found the media folder, right-click on it and select “cut” from the pop-up menu.Go back to your phone’s SD card then right-click and select paste to transfer the media folder from your phone’s internal storage to the SD card. You can also use the shortcut “Ctrl+V” to paste it as well.Once your folder is finished pasting. You have successfully transferred your Whatsapp media to your phone’s SD card.

 
It’s important to note that these methods do not permanently change WhatsApp default storage from internal storage to the SD card. However, the transfer does free up precious internal storage space and allows you to store your WhatsApp files on your SD card without rooting your phone.
