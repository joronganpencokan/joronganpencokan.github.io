Before you start any major system update, it's important to make sure that your console meets the necessary requirements. Check that your Xbox One is running on the latest version of its operating system and that you have enough storage space to download and install the update (at least 20 gigabytes). You'll also need a stable internet connection, as the update will be downloaded over the internet.

## Step Two: Prepare Your Console

Once you've checked your system, it's time to prepare your Xbox One for the update. Start by turning off your console completely - this means unplugging it from the wall, not just putting it in standby mode. Disconnect any external hard drives or accessories, and make sure your controller is fully charged.

## Step Three: Download and Install the Update

To start the update process, turn on your Xbox One and connect it to the internet. If you haven't already received a notification to download the update, go to the "Settings" menu on your console and select "System." From there, select "Updates & downloads" and then "Console update available." Follow the instructions on the screen to download and install the update.

## Step Four: Explore the New Features

Once the update is installed, your Xbox One will have a host of new features and improvements to explore. Microsoft has promised faster load times, better graphics, and more stable performance, as well as a new dashboard design and improved voice controls with Cortana. Take some time to explore the new features and get familiar with any changes to menus or controls.

## Step Five: Customize Your Experience

Finally, don't forget to customize your new Xbox One experience to your liking. One of the biggest benefits of the latest update is the ability to personalize your dashboard, allowing you to arrange your favorite games and apps in any order you choose. You can also customize your profile and preferences to suit your gaming style and preferences.

Revamping your Xbox One gaming experience is easy with the latest operating system update from Microsoft. Just follow these simple steps and you'll be enjoying faster load times, better graphics, and more intuitive controls in no time!

On November 12th, Microsoft begins rolling out the New Xbox One Experience running on Windows 10. The update deployment to consoles will start at 3:01 AM Eastern Time / 12:01 AM Pacific Time, but it’s important to be clear that Microsoft will slowly be rolling out the new update to consoles, which means that it’ll take some time until everyone gets the new update.
 
Something to keep in mind is that the time you get the update will primarily depend on your time zone and your console settings.
 
## Upgrade to the New Xbox One Experience
 
As Microsoft begins the roll out users who have the configured their Xbox One console using the Instant-on power mode will get the New Xbox One Experience automatically when the console is on Connected Standby mode.
 
If you don’t have the Instant-on power mode enabled, go to Settings > Power & startup on your Xbox One and change the settings.
 
Users who have their console configured to Energy-saving mode won’t get the November 12 update automatically. Users in this configuration will need initiate the download and update process manually.
 
If you’re on Energy-saving mode, you can either enable the Instant-on power mode, or you can go to Settings > System and manually trigger the New Xbox One Experience download by choosing “Update Now”. Again, no everyone will get the new update the same day, as such it could happen that you will have to manually check for updates a number of times throughout the week.
 

 
It’s important to point out that Xbox One consoles that do not receive the update will receive a mandatory update notification on November 23rd to the get the NXOE.
 
Alongside the new update for Xbox One running Windows 10, the software giant is also flipping the switch on the Xbox One Backward Compatibility feature, but the rollout will begin on November 12th at 12:01 PM Pacific Time. At this time, users will begin seeing their purchased Xbox 360 games populate in the Xbox One game list. If you have the Xbox 360 game disc, you will have to insert it into the Xbox One console to trigger the compatible copy from Xbox Live.
 
Remember that not all Xbox 360 games are playable on Xbox One, initially Microsoft is making compatible 104 game titles, but the list will get updated in the regular basis. If the game you like isn’t on the Backward Compatibility list, you can visit the Xbox UserVoice website to vote or submit the game you want to see next.
