It's frustrating when you click on an app icon and it starts loading, only to stop midway and then crash. You try restarting your device, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but nothing seems to work. This situation can be annoying, especially when you need that app urgently. Fortunately, there is a simple trick to reduce app frustration and always get your favorite app to open quickly. The trick is using the Hugo writing format. Keep reading to learn how you can make things simpler for you and have your apps easily accessible on your device.

Body:

The Hugo writing format is a simple layout that you can use to create an easy-to-use command line that opens your favorite applications. It is a quick and straightforward way to open your apps quickly when you need them. The Hugo command line is similar to the terminal app on your computer, but it is specifically designed for mobile devices. Using this format, you can create a shortcut for your favorite app that can be accessed from the Home screen of your device. 

To create the Hugo command line, you need to follow these easy steps:

1.  Download the Hugo app from the App Store or Google Play Store.

2.  Open the app and select 'Create New Shortcut.'

3.  Enter the name of the app you want to open and the URL or web address that you will use to access the app.

4.  Save the shortcut and add it to your device's Home screen.

5.  Click the shortcut icon, and your app will open quickly without any frustrating delays.

Using the Hugo writing format enables you to redirect the app's URL to a streamlined and more straightforward method of opening the app. You can use the URL of the app or use the App ID instead.

For instance, to open Facebook using the App ID, open up Hugo, tap on 'Create New Shortcut,' type in the app's name 'Facebook,' and enter 'fb://' as the App ID. This method will open Facebook directly without stressing the device's processor.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, app frustration can be a thing of the past. By following the steps outlined above, you can create a simple and easy way to access your favorite apps without crashing or experiencing delays. The Hugo writing format is one of the best tricks to use when you need a quick and easy fix to open apps that cause you frustration. Say goodbye to app frustration and embrace a simpler method to access your favorite apps using the Hugo writing format.

Let’s say you have a Medium app installed on your smartphone, and if you click on a Medium link on a web browser, it will load Medium’s web version rather than the mobile app.

 
## Steps to Redirect Links to Open in the App you Really Wanted


To sort these things, you need to redirect links to open the app you want. On Android, it’s possible with the help of a third-party application. And here’s how you can do it.
1. First, download & install the App named “Open Link With..” on your Android smartphone.
2. Once installed, launch it. You will be asked to grant User Access permissions. Simply grant all permissions that the app asks for.
3. Now open any link and open your Android Share Menu. On the Share Menu, select the ‘Open Link With..’ app. You will be asked to choose the app you want to open the link. The Open Link With.. app will remember your selection and will always open the link in your app.
