subtitle: Tips and Tricks to Help You Save Big During Amazon's Biggest Sale Event

Amazon Prime Day is one of the most anticipated shopping events of the year. It's a day when Amazon Prime members can access exclusive deals and discounts on a wide range of products, from electronics and gadgets to clothing and household items. The event typically takes place in July, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was postponed to October this year. The good news is that you still have the chance to make the most out of this shopping extravaganza. In this article, we'll share with you some secret strategies that can help you maximize your savings on Amazon Prime Day. Get ready to score some amazing deals and discounts.

1. Start Early

The early bird catches the worm, and this is especially true during Amazon Prime Day. To maximize your savings, you need to start preparing early. This means creating a shopping budget, making a list of the items you want to buy, and setting up notifications for deals and discounts. You should also check if you have any Amazon gift cards or reward points that you can use to further reduce your expenses.

2. Sign Up for Amazon Prime

If you're not an Amazon Prime member yet, then you're missing out on a lot of benefits. Amazon Prime members get free two-day shipping, access to exclusive TV shows and movies, ad-free music streaming, and more. But the biggest perk of being a Prime member is that you get access to Prime Day deals and discounts. So, if you want to maximize your savings on Amazon Prime Day, make sure to sign up for Amazon Prime now.

3. Use Lightning Deals

During Amazon Prime Day, you'll find a lot of Lightning Deals. These are time-limited deals that only last for a few hours or until supplies last. To make the most out of these deals, you need to act fast. Check the Lightning Deals section frequently and add the items you want to your cart immediately. Also, make sure to check if the items you're interested in are eligible for free shipping.

4. Use Price Tracking Tools

Amazon is known for its dynamic pricing, which means that the prices of products can change frequently. To ensure that you're getting the best deal possible, you should use price tracking tools like CamelCamelCamel or Keepa. These tools allow you to track the price history of a product and set up price alerts, so you'll get notified when the price drops.

5. Check Other Retailers

While Amazon is the go-to destination for Prime Day shopping, you shouldn't forget to check other retailers as well. Some retailers like Best Buy, Walmart, and Target offer their own sales and discounts during Prime Day. So, make sure to compare prices and check if you can get a better deal elsewhere.

6. Load Up Your Cart

During Prime Day, Amazon offers a special promotion called "Prime Day Countdown Deals." These deals are available in the days leading up to Prime Day, and they're a great way to save even more. To take advantage of these deals, you need to load up your cart with the items you want before Prime Day starts. Once the deals go live, all you need to do is check out, and you'll get the discounted prices.

Conclusion:

Amazon Prime Day is a great opportunity to save big on a wide range of products. By following these secret strategies, you'll be able to maximize your savings and score amazing deals and discounts. Start preparing early, sign up for Amazon Prime, use Lightning Deals, track prices with price tracking tools, check other retailers, and load up your cart. With these tips and tricks, you'll be able to make the most out of Prime Day and get the products you want at the best possible prices. Happy shopping!

Key Takeaways
 
##   Savings Tools Can Help  
 

If you're planning to make a few big purchases on Prime Day, this may be an excellent time to get a new credit card, Woroch said. Many credit cards offer sign-up bonuses that let you earn a few hundred dollars for spending a certain amount of money within the first few months. For instance, the Chase Freedom credit card offers $200 back when you spend $500 in the first three months. 

 

Once you have your shopping list, start doing your research, Woroch advises. You should review the prices of products you're planning to buy on Prime Day ahead of the sales event. This way, you know what the presale price is, so you don't get fooled by any misleading sales, like those in which original prices are marked up to make a deal look like a better value. 

 

Before Prime Day, go to Lightning Deals, Clicking on Today’s Deals, and then click Upcoming to get a Notification when deals are live, Riaz said. 

 
##   Think Big  
 

"You can shop at hundreds of other retailers and find great deals, in some cases even better discounts," Skirboll added. "Last year, RetailMeNot found that there were over 350 retailers that offered deals on and around Prime Day, so pay attention to places like Macy's, Kohl's, and Best Buy, who all might be running their own deals."

 

It’s easy to get caught up in the hype of a sales event, but keep in mind not every item will be a bargain on Prime Day, Skirboll said. 

 

"Four categories to avoid purchasing on Prime Day include gaming consoles, toys, Apple products, and cameras," she added. "Save yourself for Black Friday and closer to the holiday season when you'll typically find deeper discounts."
