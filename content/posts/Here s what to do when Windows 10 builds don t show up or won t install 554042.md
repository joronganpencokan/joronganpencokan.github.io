Desperate for Windows 10 Update? Discover the Ultimate Solution to Get Your Build On - Guaranteed!

If you're like most people, getting your Windows 10 update can be a real pain. Whether you're upgrading from an older version of Windows or simply need to update your current build, waiting for the download to complete can be a frustrating experience. Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to speed up the process and ensure that your update goes smoothly. In this article, we'll explore the ultimate solution to help you get your Windows 10 build on - guaranteed!

Preparing for Your Windows 10 Update

Before you start your Windows 10 update, there are a few things you should do to ensure the process goes as smoothly as possible:

1. Back up your data: Before you begin any update process, make sure you back up all of your important data. You can use an external hard drive or a cloud-based backup service to keep your files safe. This step is especially important if you’re upgrading from an older version of Windows.

2. Check your system requirements: Make sure your computer meets the minimum system requirements for running Windows 10. This includes having at least 1 GHz or faster processor, 1GB of RAM for 32-bit or 2GB for 64-bit, 16 GB of hard disk space for 32-bit or 20 GB for 64-bit, and a DirectX 9 or later graphics card with WDDM 1.0 driver.

3. Free up space on your computer: Windows 10 requires quite a bit of space to install – up to 20GB or more. Make sure you have enough free space on your hard drive before initiating the update.

The Ultimate Solution to Getting Your Windows 10 Update

If you're eager to get your Windows 10 update, but don't want to wait for the slow download process, there's an easier way to get it done.

Enter the Microsoft Media Creation Tool.

It's an official Microsoft tool that allows you to create a bootable USB drive or DVD containing the latest version of Windows 10. The process is quite simple and straightforward:

1. Download the Media Creation Tool from Microsoft's official website.

2. Run the tool on your computer and select "Create installation media for another PC."

3. Choose your language, edition (e.g., Home or Pro), and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).

4. Select either USB flash drive or ISO file depending on how you want to create your bootable media.

5. Follow the prompts to complete the setup process.

Once you're done, you can use the bootable media to update your computer. Simply insert the USB drive or DVD into your computer, boot from it, and follow the on-screen instructions to install the latest version of Windows 10.

The best part about using the Media Creation Tool is that it's faster and more reliable than using the Windows Update feature. You'll have a much smoother experience and can avoid common issues like failed updates or slow downloads.

Conclusion

Getting your Windows 10 update doesn't have to be a big hassle. By following a few simple steps and using the Microsoft Media Creation Tool, you can ensure that the process goes as smoothly as possible. Whether you're upgrading from an older version of Windows or just need to update your current build, the Media Creation Tool is the ultimate solution to get your build on - guaranteed!

If you’re still having problems trying to upgrade to one of the latest Windows 10 builds, here are a number of things you can try to resolve the issue. Lately, Microsoft has been rolling out new builds very quickly, recently the company released three different builds of Windows 10 in one week, including build 10158 on June 29, on June 30, build 10159 rolled out, and on July 2, the company released Windows 10 build 10162 to the Fast ring, on July 3, the ISO files were made available, and on July 6, the software giant makes build 10162 available to the Slow ring.
 
As you can see, now that we’re getting closer to the Windows 10 launch date, almost every build of the operating system will make its way through to Insiders. Unfortunately, many users are reporting (especially Surface Pro 3 owners) that the new updates are not showing up in Windows Update. Recently, we looked at some of the possible workarounds, but that wasn’t all you can try.
 
Today, a member of the Microsoft forums has published a number of instructions Windows Insiders can try to update to the latest preview:
 
- Make sure your user account is connected with your Insider-enabled Microsoft Account. This was challenging for me because the Settings app was confused and thought I was already connected when I was not. Attempting to disconnect (the only option) resulted in an error. Fortunately, there was an option to connect to my Microsoft Account in another page inside of Settings -> Accounts that worked just fine (I don’t remember which one it was, and the link is not there now).
 - Press [Windows]+[L] to lock your computer. You will know you’re using a Microsoft Account if your email address shows on the lock screen and your computer unlocks with your email password.
 - Verify that you can view your Insider statistics with the Windows Insider app.
 - Verify that you can load the Feedback app and see the currently trending feedback.
 - Open Settings and navigate to Update & security -> Windows Update -> Advanced options.
 - Make sure that the Slow build ring is selected. Switch to it if you’re on the Fast build ring.
 - Hit the [<-] button and check for updates.
 - When it’s done, reboot your computer.
 - Open Services (right-click Start, click Computer Management and navigate to Services and Applications -> Services).
 - Stop Windows Update.
 - Stop Background Intelligent Transfer Service.
 - Open Windows Explorer and navigate to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download.
 - Press [Ctrl]+[A], and then [Shift]+[Delete]. Confirm that you want to delete everything in the Download folder.
 - Reboot your computer.
 - Open Settings and navigate to Update & security -> Windows Update.
 - Check for updates.
 - When it’s done checking/downloading, switch back to the Fast build ring.
 - Check for updates again.
 - When it’s done, reboot your computer.
 - Open Settings and navigate to Update & security -> Windows Update.
 - Check for updates. Hopefully this time it will see build 10159.
 - If it found the update, but the download progress is stuck at 0%, open Task Manager and watch your Internet bandwidth usage (in the Performance tab; click More details if it’s missing).
 - When your Internet bandwidth usage drops down near 0, the download is finished or hanging.
 - Open Services.
 - Stop Windows Update.
 - Stop Background Intelligent Transfer Service.
 - Start Windows Update.
 - Check for updates, and the update should resume where it left off.

 
Chances are that going through all these instructions will fix the issue when Windows Update seems not to be able to see new updates (in particular for users on build 10130) or if you’re getting stuck trying to download and install the update. If the problems persist, you can also try previous recommendations to try to address the issue to install Windows 10 Insider Preview successfully, or you can opt to download the ISO files to do a clean install of the operating system.
