Title: Uncover the Secret to Speeding Up Your PC Instantly: Say Goodbye to Annoying Bloatware on Windows 10!

Intro: If you’ve been using Windows 10 for some time, you may have noticed that your PC is not as fast as it used to be. One of the reasons for this could be bloatware, unnecessary software that comes bundled with your computer. Bloatware can eat up resources and slow down your system, making your computer sluggish and frustrating to use. But fear not, in this article, we’ll show you how to get rid of bloatware and speed up your PC instantly.

Section 1: The Problem with Bloatware

Bloatware is software that comes pre-installed on your computer by the manufacturer or third-party partners. These programs are often unnecessary or redundant, and they slow down your PC by using up valuable system resources like CPU and RAM.

Bloatware can take many forms, including trial versions of software, toolbars, browser extensions, and even games. And while some of these programs may be useful, most of them are not, and they’re just taking up space on your hard drive.

Section 2: How to Remove Bloatware

The good news is that removing bloatware is relatively easy. One way is to use the built-in software removal tool in Windows 10. To do this, go to the Control Panel, select Programs and Features, and look for any programs you don’t need. Right-click on them and select Uninstall to remove them from your system.

Another method to remove bloatware is to use a third-party tool such as CCleaner or PC Decrapifier. These programs are designed to detect and remove unwanted software from your computer, making it faster and more efficient.

Section 3: The Benefits of Removing Bloatware

There are many reasons why removing bloatware is a good idea. For one, it frees up valuable system resources that can be used for more critical tasks such as gaming or productivity. It also helps to reduce the likelihood of software conflicts and system crashes, which can be caused by multiple programs competing for the same resources.

Furthermore, removing bloatware can help to improve your computer’s security. Some bundled programs may contain spyware or other malicious software that can compromise your privacy and put your data at risk.

Section 4: Conclusion

Bloatware is a problem that plagues many Windows 10 users. But by taking the time to remove unnecessary programs from your computer, you can speed up your PC instantly and improve its overall performance. Whether you choose to use the built-in Windows software removal tool or a third-party solution, the benefits of removing bloatware are clear: faster performance, improved security, and a smoother computing experience. So if you’re tired of dealing with a slow and frustrating PC, it’s time to say goodbye to bloatware and hello to a faster, more efficient system.

Let's jump in. 

 
## Getting rid of bloatware


When you buy a new PC, it often comes with a Windows license and a Windows install filled with bloatware. The other day, I got roped into looking at some laptops installed in the office of some friends. They all had Start menus filled with bloatware. My friend was unhappy and we suddenly found ourselves in a teachable moment. I'll share with you what I shared with them.

 
### 1. Once you get your PC, look at the apps 


Start by just looking at the apps in your search bar. You'd be surprised that even a bare, simple install of Windows 10 often comes with garbage like Candy Crush Friends Saga, Candy Crush Saga, and Cooking Fever.

 
### 2. Uninstall the apps 


The best thing to do is uninstall these apps. In the search box, start typing "add" and the add or remove programs option will come up. Click it.

 
### 3. Find the annoying app and click to make it disappear 


Scroll on down to the offending app, click it, and then click Uninstall. Do this for each bloatware application.

 
### If you don't see the app listed under settings...


Sometimes, you won't find the app listed in the settings apps & features panel. In those cases, you might be able to right-click on the menu item and select Uninstall.

 
## Using apps instead of removing apps manually 


Going through all the bulk apps can be time-consuming and unnecessary manual labor. So, like in many cases, there's an app for that. Bulk Crap Uninstaller or PC Decrapifier are some apps that can help, but simply uninstalling the annoying apps usually gets the job done just fine.  

 
## Risks in using apps 


The risk in using a third-party uninstall tool was illustrated quite vividly by the always-in-trouble CCleaner, from last month's favorite privacy violator Avast.

## Disabling Start Menu ads


Microsoft helpfully calls the ads it plasters in its Start menu "suggestions." Once you know that this "feature" is yet another annoying bulk item in disguise, you can turn it off.  

 
### Type "suggestions" in the search box 


To find and disable this feature, type "suggestions" into the search box and then click "Show suggestions occasionally in Start."

 
### 2. Turn off 


After selecting "show suggestions occasionally in start," just click the blue button and the "on" status should switch to "off." Then, voilà...no more pesky ads! 

 
## Removing the tiles from the Start menu


If you're like me, the Start menu tiles give you Windows 8 nightmares. On my Windows installs, one of the first things I do is remove them all. 
Doing so is very easy, simply unpin...

 
## Unpin the undesired 


 For each tile you want to remove, right-click and select Unpin from Start.  
Once you do this with all tiles, you'll have a Start menu that looks and feels the way a Start menu should look and feel.  
So there you go. Quick, clean, and easy. Let me know what you use to clean up your Windows 10 installations. If you've found a particularly egregious bit of crapware, tell us about that below, as well, so we can all share your pain.
