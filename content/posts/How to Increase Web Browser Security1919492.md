# Are you vulnerable online? Learn how to fortify your browsing defenses with these web security hacks today!

The internet has become an integral part of our lives. We use it for communication, entertainment, shopping, and even for storing important information. However, the vast amount of information available online also makes us vulnerable to cyber threats. Online security is a major concern, and it is important to understand how to protect yourself from online threats. Here are some web security hacks you can use to fortify your browsing defenses.

## Use Strong Passwords

Passwords are the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your accounts. Hence, it is important to use strong and unique passwords for all your accounts. Your passwords should include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using common words or personal information in your passwords. Also, consider using a password manager to generate and store your passwords securely.

## Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. When enabled, you need to enter a unique code (received via text message or authentication app) in addition to your password, to log in to your account. This prevents hackers from gaining access even if they have your password.

## Install a VPN

A virtual private network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic, making it difficult for hackers to intercept or monitor your online activities. It also hides your IP address, making it difficult for websites to track your location or online behavior. Hence, using a VPN is a great way to protect your privacy and stay safe online.

## Use Anti-virus Software

Anti-virus software is designed to detect and remove malicious software (malware) on your computer or device. It is important to install and regularly update anti-virus software to protect yourself from viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, and other malware that can compromise your online security.

## Be Wary of Phishing Emails

Phishing emails are designed to trick you into sharing sensitive information, such as your login credentials or credit card details. These emails usually appear to come from a legitimate source, such as your bank or online retailer. To avoid falling prey to phishing emails, be cautious of any email or message that asks for sensitive information. Always verify the authenticity of the sender and avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.

## Keep Your Software Up-to-Date

Software updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities in the software. Hence, it is important to keep your operating system and software up-to-date to ensure that you have the latest security updates.

In conclusion, the internet can be a dangerous place, and it is important to take steps to protect your online security. By using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, installing a VPN, using anti-virus software, being wary of phishing emails, and keeping your software up-to-date, you can fortify your browsing defenses and stay safe online.

Unless you've taken the time to configure your browser's privacy, there's a good chance your browser isn't as secure as you'd like it. From location tracking to nosy cookies to pop-ups — web browsers are shot through with loopholes that can compromise your security in unintended ways. If you've been thinking about fortifying your web browser's security, now is a good time. Here's how to do it.

 
##   Choose a Secure Web Browser  
 

The vast majority of web surfers can be found on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge. But that doesn't mean you're limited to these choices. There are heaps of secure browser alternatives, including Iridium browser, GNU IceCat browser, Tor browser, and more. But no matter which browser you use, remember that there's no such thing as a 100% secure web browser on its own. Luckily, you can increase security on any browser by locking down the settings and using a VPN (more on that below).

 
##   Lock Down Your Browser's Privacy Settings  
 

Have you checked your browser's settings lately? Configuring your privacy settings is one of the most important things you can do to secure your web browser. By default, many browser settings leave your data exposed. At a minimum, you should:

 
If you want stronger security and privacy on the web, consider getting a VPN. A VPN uses encryption and IP masking to hide your private data and activities on the web.
 
- Disable pop-ups and redirections. In addition to being annoying, bad actors can use pop-ups and redirects to spread malicious software.Don't allow automatic downloads. Automatic downloads can contain malware and viruses. Ask to be prompted before downloading anything.Keep cookies in check. Delete cookies after browsing and turn off third-party access to cookies.Restrict access to your location, camera, and microphone. Set your browser to ask permission before accessing these features.Deactivate ActiveX. Active X is considered outdated and poses security risks. Consider deactivating Flash and Javascript as well.Turn on "Send a Do Not Track request." It will help prevent websites from tracking you, but it's not guaranteed.

 

Here's where to find your privacy settings on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari:

 
- Chrome privacy settings: Click the "more" ellipsis (three vertical dots) in the browser's top right corner. Click Settings, then scroll down the page and click Advanced to access your privacy settings.
 - Firefox privacy settings. Click the hamburger menu (looks like three vertical lines) in the browser's top right corner. Select Preferences, then click Privacy & Security.
 - Microsoft Edge: Click the three dots (ellipses) in the upper left-hand corner of the browser. Go to Privacy and Security.
 - Safari Privacy Settings: Go to Safari > Preferences in the top corner of the browser. Click the Privacy tab to view and update your privacy settings.

 

Take the time to get familiar with your browser's specific privacy settings and research additional security tips for your browser type online. You will likely discover many loopholes you didn't know existed.

 
##   Keep Your Web Browser Up-to-Date  
 

Even the most secure web browser can't protect you from the latest threats if it's out-of-date. Every browser is a little different when it comes to software updates. Here's how updates work in Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Safari:

 
- Google Chrome: Any new updates will automatically trigger whenever you close the browser. To check if Chrome is up-to-date, go to Chrome > About Google Chrome in the browser's top-left corner.
 - Firefox: Firefox lets you turn on or off automatic updates under Firefox > Preferences. To check your Firefox version, go to Firefox > About Firefox in the browser's top-left corner.
 - Microsoft Edge: Edge updates distribute through Automatic Updates. To check your version, open Edge, click the ellipses (3 dots) in the upper right-hand corner, then select About Edge.
 - Apple Safari: To check your Safari version, click Safari > About Safari in the browser's top-left corner. You can also configure Safari extensions to update automatically.

 
##   Browse In Private or Incognito Mode  
 

While browsing in private mode won't give you complete privacy—your IP address and activities can still be tracked—it prevents your web history, browser cache, form data, and cookies from being stored after you quit the browser.

 

Google Chrome calls private browsing Incognito Mode. But you can access private browsing on Firefox and Apple's Safari browser, too. In Microsoft Internet Explorer, it's called InPrivate tabs but works essentially the same as all the other services.

 
After using your browser's private or incognito mode, be sure to close the browser completely when you're done using it. Don't just minimize or hide it, as that won't erase your data.
 
##   Use Browser Security Extensions  
 

Most browsers give you the option of installing additional security extensions to bolster your browser security and privacy. When using any extension, make sure the browser you're using endorses it. Enable automatic updates, so the extension is always up-to-date.

 
Using private or incognito mode doesn't prevent your web data from being tracked or seen by your ISP, school, or employer. If you want to completely hide your IP address, location, identity, and activities when browsing the web, consider using a VPN service.
 

Here are some of the best privacy extensions to get you started:

 
Microsoft no longer supports Internet Explorer and recommends that you update to the newer Edge browser. Head to their site to download the newest version.
 
- HTTPS Everywhere: HTTPS Everywhere works with Firefox, Chrome, and Opera. It works by encrypting your data with many major websites. (By the way, never buy anything from a website that doesn't use HTTPS!).
 - Adblock Plus: AdBlock Plus is an open-source extension for Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Edge, Opera, Maxthon, and the Yandex Browser to stop ads from cluttering up your pages and videos.
 - Click & Clean: Click & Clean works on Chrome and Firefox that erases your private data, including your browsing history, cache, cookies, passwords, form data, local storage, and more.
 - Disconnect: Disconnect works by blocking hundreds of invisible tracker requests inside your browser and apps, increasing page load times. It's available for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera.
 - Privacy Badger: Similar to Disconnect, Privacy Badger, works to block invisible website trackers automatically. It's compatible with Firefox, Opera, and Android.
 - Blur: Blur is an excellent privacy tool that works by masking your personal information online, including your email address, phone number, credit card numbers, and more. Blur installs into your browser and works with Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari.

 

You can get Chrome extensions from the Chrome Web Store, Firefox extensions from the Firefox Add-ons site, and Internet Explorer extensions from their Internet Explorer Gallery website. You can also Google the web browser name plus the word "extensions" to locate extensions quickly.

 
##   Use a VPN When You Browse the Web  
 

Even the most secure browser with the most advanced settings can't keep your browsing activities truly safe or private from your ISP, employer, or school. That's why you should consider getting a VPN. A VPN is hands down the best way to secure your web browser.

 
Be careful when installing browser extensions. While many extensions can bolster security, add-ons from shady sources can be risky. Never install add-ons from websites that insist you run the software before accessing the site. It could be malware in disguise.
 

A VPN service protects your web privacy and security in three critical ways:

 
- Disguises your IP address and location: VPNs spoof your IP address and location, so you can't be tracked by your ISP (internet service provider), search engines, and websites.Encapsulates your web traffic: With a VPN, all your data packets are hidden inside additional packets, so your data moves in a private "tunnel" over unsecured networks.Encrypts your web traffic: VPN services scramble your data with military-grade encryption, so your data is virtually impossible to hack by outside forces. It's vital when browsing over public Wi-Fi.

 
##   Exercise Common Sense When Browsing  
 

And last but not least, exercise common sense when browsing the web. Even with the most secure browser and VPN, malicious websites can trick you into clicking on malicious links or downloading malware. Be wary of shortened links (e.g., bit.ly), which can hide malicious links, and avoid non-HTTPS sites whenever possible. And lastly, never permit downloads or install software unless it's from a trusted site.
