Halo Infinite has taken the gaming world by storm with its intense multiplayer modes and the all-new Battle Pass. Gamers worldwide have been grinding away to level up their Battle Pass and earn rewards. The competition is tough, but with these secret tips, you can unleash your inner Spartan and level up lightning-fast.

1. Play the Objective
The objective isn't just a way to win the game, but it's also an excellent way to earn XP. Playing the objective means capturing flags or holding strong points, and the longer you hold onto them, the more XP you'll earn.

2. Complete Challenges
Challenges are a great way to earn bonus XP quickly. Daily and weekly challenges offer players extra opportunities to gain Battle Pass XP in a short amount of time.

3. Work with a Squad
Playing with a team can make completing objectives and challenges much more manageable. Plus, working with a squad makes the game a lot more fun. So gather your friends, and start leveling up together.

4. Focus on the Weekly Quests
Each weekly quest offers a significant amount of XP points. Focusing on these quests first is a sure-fire way to progress up the Battle Pass ranks rapidly. 

5. Master the Weapons
Becoming comfortable with your weapon of choice can give you a huge advantage over your opponents. Spend some time in the training mode or practice in multiplayer to master your favorite weapon.

6. Use Boosts
Boosts offer temporary bonuses to XP gain and can provide a significant boost to leveling speed. Use the XP boosts wisely; for example, use them when completing challenges or during double XP events.

7. Attend Events
Events offer the opportunity to gain XP quickly and earn unique rewards. Keep an eye out for special events and make sure to participate to get the maximum possible rewards.

8. Focus on Performance
In Halo Infinite, your personal performance is a significant determinant of the XP you'll earn. Focusing on improving your stats and K/D ratio can help you gain more XP and level up faster.

Final Thoughts

343 industries have made their sixth entry into the Halo series, Halo Infinite. Halo Infinite’s Multiplayer is here and is free to play. This is amazing as every player can play the game. Halo Infinite also has a Battle Pass and an XP system. Now to complete the Battle Pass, you will have to get XP. For every tier, the XP requirement increases. In today’s guide, I will show you how to get XP fast and level up your Battle Pass in Halo Infinite.
 
## How to get XP fast and Level up your Battle Pass in Halo Infinite
 
There are 100 tiers to the Battle Pass in Halo Infinite. In those tiers, the rewards that say Free on them will be obtainable by everyone. Otherwise, you will have to purchase the Premium Battle Pass for 1000 (10 USD) credits or buy the Premium Pass Bundle for 2800 (25 USD) credits as it will unlock the first 25 tiers instantly. The best ways to get XP fast are:
 
### Play the Daily and Weekly challenges to Level Up the Battle Pass in Halo Infinite
 
The challenges you get on a weekly and daily basis are your main sources of XP in Halo Infinite. Keep on playing matches and complete the challenges as they will provide more XP than a couple of games. Weekly Challenges are tasks like getting kills with certain guns, vehicles, playing different modes, and the like. On completion, you will earn a large chunk of XP. These challenges refresh every week and get incrementally tougher. After a certain point, you won’t get Weekly Challenges as it will be nearing the end of the Battle Pass. Instead, you will be given an Ultimate Challenge to do and on completion will grant you an exclusive reward outside of the Battle Pass.
 
Daily Challenges are similar to weekly challenges but are not as grueling. They offer less XP in comparison and refresh daily. They are worth doing as by the time you will complete a Weekly Challenge, you will complete a lot of Daily Challenges granting a lot of XP in Halo Infinite.
 
### Using XP Boosts to get XP fast
 

 
XP Boosts, as stated in the name, grants a player an increased XP gain for some time in Halo Infinite. This increase is a multiplier so whatever XP you get, will be multiplied by the XP Boost and you will receive that much XP. This only affects the XP you gain in matches and not from your Challenges. They cost 200 credits but are also available in the Battle Pass itself. So, if you are going to purchase them then I suggest buying the Battle Pass itself.
 
### Buying the Levels of the Battle Pass through Credits
 
The last method of leveling up your Battle Pass is through buying the Levels with credits. Credits are the premium currency of Halo Infinite. To get them you will have to buy them with IRL money. Each level of the Battle Pass costs 200 credits with is about 2 USD. Since there are 100 tiers, you will spend 20,000 credits from Tier 1 to Tier 100 and it will cost a total of 200 USD. This is the most expensive method to level up.
 
This was all about getting XP & Leveling Up your Battle Pass in Halo Infinite. Since it is a free game, I strongly advise not to spend the money in the form of the third method. Instead, if you are going to purchase the Battle Pass, then just get that and nothing else. The Battle Pass has everything you will need to level it up. Hopefully, this guide helped you out.
