# Unleash Your Full Potential in Apex Legends Season 9: Our Expert Tips for Leveling Up Legacy Battle Pass!

Apex Legends, one of the most popular online multiplayer battle royale games, has released its ninth season, which brings a new legend, a new weapon, and plenty of new content including the Legacy Battle Pass. With the Legacy Battle Pass, players can unlock exclusive rewards such as skins, emotes, and voice lines.

To level up the Legacy Battle Pass and unlock all of its rewards, players need to earn XP by playing matches, completing challenges, and leveling up. However, leveling up the Battle Pass is not an easy task, especially for new players who are trying to catch up with veterans who have already unlocked most of the rewards.

But fear not, as we have expert tips and strategies to help you unleash your full potential in Apex Legends Season 9 and level up the Legacy Battle Pass quickly.

## Prioritize Completing Daily and Weekly Challenges

Daily and weekly challenges offer the maximum amount of XP in the least amount of time. It's therefore essential to prioritize completing these challenges over just playing matches. Daily challenges can be completed once per day and offer 3,000 XP each, while weekly challenges offer a higher amount of XP and can be completed once per week.

Make sure to check the challenges tab regularly to maximize your XP gains. Try to focus on the challenges that can be completed easily and quickly, such as dealing damage with specific weapons, reviving teammates, or staying alive for a certain amount of time.

## Play with a Squad

Playing with friends or other players can significantly increase your chances of earning more XP. Playing as a squad can help you survive longer in fights, revive each other if needed, and complete challenges that require teamwork such as dealing damage or winning matches.

Moreover, players gain an XP boost for playing with friends, and the boost increases depending on the number of players in the squad. The boost can stack up to 10%, which means you can earn additional XP by playing with a full squad of three.

## Focus on Winning Matches

While kills and damage dealt are crucial for increasing your XP gains, winning matches offers the most substantial amount of XP. Winning a match can give you up to 9000 XP, while a kill earns you only 50 XP.

Therefore, it's essential to focus on winning matches by playing strategically, communicating with your squad, and taking smart fights. Avoid hot drops or crowded areas and try to land in a safe spot where you can loot for good weapons and gear.

## Take Advantage of Double XP Events

Apex Legends occasionally holds Double XP events, which give players a massive boost in the amount of XP they earn during matches. Keep an eye on the news section for any upcoming events and take advantage of them by playing more matches and completing challenges.

Moreover, buying the Battle Pass gives players a small boost in XP gains and can potentially save you more time in leveling up the Legacy Battle Pass.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, by following these expert tips and strategies, players can level up the Legacy Battle Pass quickly and unlock all the exclusive rewards. Prioritize completing daily and weekly challenges, play with a squad, focus on winning matches, and take advantage of Double XP events. With these tips, you can unleash your full potential in Apex Legends Season 9 and become a seasoned player. Good luck, Legends!

Read further to know how you can level up your battle pass in apex legends season 9.
 
## How To Level Up Your Battle Pass In Apex Legends Season 9?
 

Players need to get 10 stars to upgrade their battle pass. Stars can be gathered by doing multiple daily and weekly tasks. Daily tasks are fairly easy to complete, but the catch is that they do refresh every 24 hours. To complete daily tasks you will have to log in every day as the task will only be available for that day.
Weekly tasks are more rewarding but are more difficult as well. Killing using a specific weapon is one of the examples of a weekly task. Weekly tasks are there even when the week is over so you keep them down on your priority list. Weekly tasks fetch you more stars so we would recommend you to not skip them.
 
Players need to collect 10 stars to upgrade the battle pass this season, if you get more than 10 stars the balance will be carry-forwarded to the next battle pass upgrade. Players can change their daily tasks using the legend coins. Do spend carefully and choose a daily task that is easy to complete and aligns with your weekly task as well. With the new 3v3 arena there is a lot for players to unlock by upgrading the battle pass this season. While there isn’t any hard and fast deadline the earlier you upgrade, the better you get at the battle royal. You can also buy the battle pass upgrades using Apex coins, so if you have money to spare you won’t have to grind your way through.
