Use your creativity to find a way to distract them, whether it’s causing a commotion nearby or pulling off a major heist in the opposite direction.

Step 3: Save the Fire Truck to Your Garage

Once you've successfully stolen the fire truck, the last step is to save it to your garage. This is important because it will allow you to access the water cannon and other features of the truck whenever you want. To save the truck, simply drive it to your garage and park it in the designated spot. You can then access it whenever you want from your garage.

Step 4: Enjoy the Ultimate Fire-Power

Now that you have the fire truck in your garage, you can access the ultimate fire-power in GTA 5. The water cannon on the fire truck is incredibly powerful and can be used to take out other vehicles and even buildings. It's a great weapon to have in your arsenal, and it's fun to use in destruction missions as well.

It is almost a decade since Rockstar Games launched GTA 5 and despite that, it is still one of the best open-world games of all time. There are different types of vehicles from a simple bike to extravert fighter jets, you can use in the game.  So today we will look at how to get a fire truck for the heist in GTA 5.
 

 
## How to Get a Fire Truck in GTA 5?
 
Bureau Raid is a heist in which if you proceed with a fire truck approach you need to get a fire truck to execute the heist.  You can get a fire truck by stealing one from the Los Santos Fire Department. This is an easier way to complete this side mission. However, that won’t get you a Gold Medal after completing the mission. Follow these steps to get a fire truck with a Gold Medal in GTA 5:
 
- Go to Contacts and call Emergency Services.
 - Then, after you call 911 you will be asked what is your emergency.
 - Choose the Fire department, which will dispatch a fire truck by your location.
 - Carjack the Firetruck and lose the cops which will prompt a destination for you.
 - Park the Firetruck at the destination.

 
Also, note that to get a gold medal you need to deliver the fire truck with no damage along with calling 911.
 
One of the core reasons is because it is filled with Easter eggs and references from cult classics. These cult classics range from Breaking Bad to Die Hard. One of the references lies within a mission in GTA 5, which is from Mission Impossible. If you have seen Mission Impossible you would remember the iconic scene of Ethan Hunt executing a heist with a getaway fire truck. This mission is similar to that.
