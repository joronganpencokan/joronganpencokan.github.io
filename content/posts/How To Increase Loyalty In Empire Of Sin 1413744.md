# Secret Blueprint for Dominating Empire of Sin: Learn How to Boost Loyalty and Rule the Criminal Underworld!

If you are a fan of strategy games, you might have heard of Empire of Sin, a new game developed by Romero Games and published by Paradox Interactive. The game is set in the 1920s during the Prohibition era and allows players to build their criminal empire, recruit gangsters, and engage in fierce battles with rival gangs.

Like any other strategy game, Empire of Sin requires a solid plan and strategic thinking to succeed. One of the critical factors in the game is loyalty, which determines the stability and strength of your empire. In this article, we will share with you some essential tips on how to boost loyalty and dominate the criminal underworld!

## Understand the Importance of Loyalty

Loyalty is crucial in Empire of Sin as it affects many aspects of your gameplay, such as income, recruitment, and combat effectiveness. Low loyalty can lead to desertion, betrayal, and even rebellion, which can quickly collapse your empire.

Therefore, it's crucial to understand the factors that can affect loyalty in the game, such as:

- Respect: how much your gangsters respect you as a leader.
- Fear: how much your gangsters fear you as a leader.
- Satisfaction: how satisfied your gangsters are with their role and rewards.
- Reputation: how your empire is perceived in the criminal world.

By managing these factors carefully, you can maintain high loyalty and prevent your empire from crumbling.

## Recruit and Develop Loyal Gangsters

The first step of boosting loyalty is to recruit loyal gangsters. In Empire of Sin, each gangster has a unique personality and loyalty level, which can be affected by their traits, relationships, and activities.

To maximize loyalty, you should look for gangsters with high loyalty traits, such as loyal and faithful. You can also develop loyalty by building relationships with your gangsters through conversation, gifts, and shared activities.

Moreover, you should assign your gangsters to roles that suit their skills and preferences to increase their satisfaction and loyalty. For example, if a gangster is good at handling finances, you can put them in charge of your speakeasy or casino.

## Create a Well-Managed Empire

To maintain high loyalty, you need to create a well-managed empire that provides your gangsters with security, resources, and opportunities. In Empire of Sin, you can achieve this by:

- Building and upgrading facilities: such as speakeasies, casinos, and brothels that generate income and improve satisfaction.
- Investing in security: such as hiring guards and upgrading your hideout to prevent rival gang attacks and police raids.
- Managing your empire's reputation: by completing missions, making deals, and engaging in favorable activities.

By creating a successful and stable empire, your gangsters can feel secure and satisfied with their roles, boosting their loyalty and commitment.

## Be Ruthless When Necessary

Finally, sometimes you may have to take ruthless actions to maintain your empire's stability and loyalty. This can involve punishing disloyal gangsters, negotiating with rivals, or even eliminating them.

While being ruthless can be challenging or go against your moral code, it's necessary to survive and thrive in the criminal underworld. You can balance your actions by being fair and just, respecting your loyal gangsters, and earning their trust and respect.

In conclusion, loyalty is a crucial factor in Empire of Sin, and by understanding its importance and managing it carefully, you can dominate the criminal underworld and build your empire to new heights. So, use these tips and start your journey to becoming the ultimate mob boss!

Loyalty is a crucial aspect of Empire of Sin. Low loyalty similar to real-life can lead to conspiracies that can impact your empire in the game. Hence, you should thrive to maintain the high loyalty of all the crew members that you have recruited. However, due to high conflicts of interest in running the empire, it is not at all easy to maintain a high loyalty level, and that’s what we are here for. Here’s how you can increase loyalty in Empire of Sin.
 
## Empire of Sin: How to Increase Loyalty
 
Assigning better roles to your crew members and paying their salaries regularly on time can increase their loyalty in Empire of Sin. Every time you assign the role of advisor to someone, their loyalty will significantly boost. But it’s not all benefits, assigning the role of advisor requires 250 notoriety, which can be pricey for some.
 

 
Keeping the crew members employed for a long time also increases their loyalty. With every passing month, your employees will get +8 loyalty. But don’t hold them long in the same position. Along with keeping your employees for a longer-term, it is also essential to assign higher roles to them and increase their salary regularly.
 
If you fire an employee, their loyalty will decrease by -250. But it is also necessary sometimes to fire a few employees to hire someone else. Suppose, you have an employee who has a conflict with someone. If you want to hire that other person, you have to fire the employee who is having a conflict. Hence, sometimes, it won’t be in your hand.
 
But that is nothing to worry about as time will heal everything and the fired employee’s loyalty will get back to normal. That’s everything you need to know about how to increase loyalty in Empire of Sin. For more guides on different games, ensure visiting our Gaming Guides section.
