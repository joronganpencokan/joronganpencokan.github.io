In case you are not aware, Thunderbird 5 is now released and is available for download. This latest release contains many bugs fixed and comes with extra features like new addons manager, tab dragging and reordering and enhanced account manager. For Ubuntu users, you can either download the tar file, unzip it and run the executable file or use a PPA and install it via the Ubuntu Software Center. The latter method is preferable as it allows you to receive regular update and is able to better integrate with the system.

 
## Installation
 
To install Thunderbird 5 via PPA, open a terminal and type the following:
 
Done. Go to “Applications -> Internet -> Thunderbird” to run the application.
 
## Integrate Thunderbird to the Messaging menu
 
For the Thunderbird to appear in the Messaging menu, all you have to do is to install the “Ubuntu Unity Messaging Menu” extension.
 
In Thunderbird, go to “Tools -> Add-ons“. Search for “Messaging Menu”. Install the first extension that appears in the screen.
 

 
Restart Thunderbird after the installation. The Thunderbird entry should appear in the messaging menu now. 
 
## Replacing Evolution 
 
If you are using the calendar feature in Evolution and you want to migrate to Thunderbird, you might be disappointed to find that Thunderbird does not come with a Calendar feature by default. You can, however, install the several extensions to implement the calendar feature. 
 
Lightning is the most popular (and most comprehensive) Calendar extension for Thunderbird. It is almost a “must-install” for every Thunderbird user. 
 
Alternatively, if you are a Google Calendar user, you can also install the Google Calendar Tab extension that loads your Google Calendar in a new tab.
 
If you are using IMAP to check your email accounts, there is no need to do any email migration from Evolution. However, for those using the POP protocol, follow the instructions here to migrate all your settings from Evolution.
 
Lastly, enjoy your Thunderbird. 
 
Note: Thunderbird could be the default email client for Ubuntu Oneiric. It will be good if you can familiarize with it now.
