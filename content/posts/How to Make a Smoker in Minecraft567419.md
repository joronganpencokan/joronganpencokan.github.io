Step 4: Enjoy your delicious creations
As your food cooks in the smoker, you will notice smoke emanating from the top of the tower. This smoke adds flavor and aroma to your food, making it even more delicious. Once your food has finished cooking, it will appear in the result slot of the furnace. You can now take it out and enjoy your delicious creation!

In Minecraft, a smoker is a craftable block that you can use to cook food items. It requires a furnace and some wood as ingredients, so it’s pretty easy to make. While you can cook food in a furnace, turning it into a smoker allows you to cook twice as fast. The furnace does lose the ability to smelt ore, though, so ideally, you’ll want to have access to both.

 
##   What You Need to Make a Smoker in Minecraft  
 

To craft a smoker, you’ll need to gather the following materials:

 
- A crafting table (requires four wood planks)A furnace (requires eight cobblestones)Four logs or blocks of wood

 
##   How to Make a Smoker in Minecraft  
 

Once you've compiled the Minecraft smoker recipe, here’s how to make a smoker in Minecraft.

 
- Make yourself a crafting table and furnace if you haven’t already, and gather at least four logs.
 - If you've already placed the furnace, you will need to mine it and place it in your inventory to turn it into a smoker.
 - Open the crafting table interface.
 - Place the furnace in the center slot of the crafting table interface, and surround it with four wood blocks on the top, bottom, left, and right sides.
 - You can use any combination of different types of logs, they don't all have to be the same type, and you can also use wood blocks taken from villages. Planks will not work.
 - Move the smoker from the crafting table interface to your inventory.
 - Place the smoker in a convenient location.
 - If you need to move the smoker in the future, use a pickaxe to remove it. If you use any other tool or fists to break the smoker, that will destroy it without the option to pick it up.

 
##   How to Find a Smoker in Minecraft  
 

While the smoker is pretty easy to craft, you can find them already placed in randomly generated villages worldwide. If you can find a butcher villager, you can take their smoker for your use.
