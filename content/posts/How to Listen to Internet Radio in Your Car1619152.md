# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Listen to Internet Radio in Your Car - Try This Game-Changing Trick Now!

If you love listening to music while driving, then you're in for a treat. Thanks to modern technology, you no longer have to rely on old-fashioned radio stations or CDs to get your favorite tunes. With the internet, you can stream music directly to your car through your smartphone or other devices.

In this article, we will show you a game-changing trick that will make it super easy for you to listen to internet radio in your car. So, fasten your seatbelt, and let's get started.

## Step 1: Get a Dash Mount

The first step is to make sure you have a dash mount for your smartphone. A dash mount will securely attach your phone to your car's dashboard or vent, making it easy to access and use while you're driving. There are many types of dash mounts available on the market, so choose one that fits your smartphone and car model.

## Step 2: Download a Radio App

The second step is to download a radio app that supports internet streaming. There are many free and paid apps available that allow you to stream your favorite radio stations from around the world. Some popular radio apps include TuneIn Radio, iHeartRadio, and Pandora.

Once you've downloaded the app, make sure to create an account and customize your playlist. This will ensure that you have access to your favorite stations and songs, and you don't have to spend time searching for them while driving.

## Step 3: Connect to Your Car's Audio System

The third and final step is to connect your smartphone to your car's audio system. Most modern cars have Bluetooth connectivity, which makes it easy to sync your phone and car audio. If your car doesn't have Bluetooth, you can use an auxiliary cable or FM transmitter to connect your phone to the car's audio system.

To connect your phone via Bluetooth, go to your car's settings menu, and select "Bluetooth." Then, turn on your phone's Bluetooth, and select your car's audio system from the list of available devices. Once connected, you can start streaming your favorite music and enjoy the ride.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, listening to internet radio in your car has never been easier with the help of a dash mount, radio app, and Bluetooth connectivity. By following these simple steps, you can enjoy high-quality music and keep up with your favorite radio shows while on the road.

So, why not give it a try? You won't believe how game-changing this trick can be until you experience it for yourself. Happy streaming!

What to Know

They require an internet connection via a phone or mobile hotspot.Some cars include built-in mobile hotspots, but there is usually a fee for the service.

 
##   Required Equipment for Listening to Internet Radio in Your Car  
 

Listening to traditional AM/FM radio or HD radio is as simple as it gets. Almost any head unit has a radio tuner, and there's a decent chance it will be capable of receiving HD radio. Internet radio, however, requires a handful of different components to work, most of which do not come included with your OEM or aftermarket stereo.

 

There are two things you need if you want to listen to internet radio in your car: a mobile internet connection and a device that's capable of accessing internet radio content. Smartphones provide a great way to listen to internet radio on the road since they combine both of those functionalities into a single, portable package that you're probably already carrying around with you.

 

Aside from a smartphone, you can also access internet radio via your car's head unit (if it's compatible) or through a separate mobile hotspot. Some cars come with OEM head units that can access internet radio and built-in Wi-Fi hotspots, allowing you to share a connection with other devices.

 
##   Listening to Internet Radio in Your Car With a Smartphone  
 

If you have a smartphone with a decent data plan, it's the easiest and least expensive way to bring internet radio to your car. If you have some way of connecting your phone to your head unit, all you have to do is connect the phone as you would normally and download the appropriate internet radio app.

 

If you don't have a method of connecting your head unit to your phone, you have a few options, depending on the capabilities of your head unit:

 
- Bluetooth car kit
 - FM transmitter
 - FM modulator
 - USB connection

 
##   Locating Internet Radio Apps  
 

The best and easiest way to listen to internet radio on your phone, and in your car, is via the appropriate app. Some internet radio services that offer apps include:

 
- Spotify
 - Pandora
 - Last.fm
 - iHeartRadio
 - LiveXLive
 - TuneIn Radio

 

Some apps, like TuneIn, act as aggregators that provide access to simulcast streams of physical AM and FM stations, while others allow you to create your own, customized stations based on your preferences. Others, like Pandora, use complex algorithms to generate custom stations based on how you rate individual songs that pop up.

 
##   Using a Head Unit to Listen to Internet Radio  
 

In addition to smartphone apps, some head units come with built-in radio apps or allow you to install radio apps that provide access to many of those same services. If your head unit came with that functionality, all you need to do is add an internet connection, in the form of tethering your phone or obtaining a mobile hotspot. Other cars come with built-in mobile hotspots, which you may have to pay to activate.
