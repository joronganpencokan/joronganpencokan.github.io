# Unlock the Secret to Group Chatting on Snapchat - Your Friends Will Thank You!

Are you tired of sending the same message to multiple friends on Snapchat one by one? Do you always forget to update your group of friends about your latest plans? Fear not, as we reveal the secret to making group chatting on Snapchat a breeze - your friends will thank you!

Firstly, make use of the group chat feature on Snapchat. To start a group chat, tap and hold on a friend's name until the option to "Create Group" pops up. From there, add all the friends you want to chat with in a single thread. You can name your group chat too, which makes it easier to identify and find later.

The real secret here is the "Quick Chat" feature. Have you ever had multiple conversations ongoing in a group chat simultaneously, making it difficult to keep track of who's talking and what's being discussed? By tapping and holding on a friend's name within the group chat, you can select "Quick Chat" to start a private chat with that person within the group. This way, you can have multiple conversations going on at the same time without confusing anyone.

Another useful tip is to use the "Mute" feature. Let's face it - some friends can be more active on Snapchat than others, and receive notifications every time they send a message can be distracting. To avoid getting bogged down by constant notifications, select the group chat you want to mute and tap on the gear icon on the top right-hand corner. From there, toggle the "Mute Notifications" button to turn off notifications for that particular chat. You'll still see new messages, but you won't be alerted about them.

Lastly, don't be afraid to use Snapchat's built-in tools, such as stickers and filters, to make your group chat more fun and engaging. Group chats are a great way to stay in touch with friends and keep each other updated on the latest events or gossip. By making use of Snapchat's features, you can make your group chats more memorable and enjoyable.

In conclusion, group chatting on Snapchat can be a great way to keep in touch with multiple friends and stay up-to-date on each other's lives. However, managing multiple conversations and notifications can be overwhelming. By using the "Quick Chat," "Mute," and other built-in tools, you can make group chatting on Snapchat a breeze and your friends will thank you.

##   Where to Find Your Group  
 

Previous versions of the Snapchat app used to display a Groups tab on the Friends tab, but that feature has since been taken away in more recent versions. If you frequently interact with your group, the group will be listed in your most recent conversations on your Friends tab â€” the same way that conversations you have with individual friends are listed there.

 
Once a group has been created, you can't remove friends from it. Each member can only remove themselves from the group by tapping the menu icon in the top left and selecting Leave Group.
 

Just tap the group name from your Friends tab to open the group chat. If you haven't interacted with a group in a while or you cleared your conversations, you can find a group by tapping the magnifying glass or search field at the top of the screen on any tab and doing a search for the group name.

 
##   How to Use Your Snapchat Group  
 

There are three main ways to interact with your Snapchat group:

 

Chat: This is the most obvious and basic group feature. Just tap the group name to open the chat and start chatting by text (with options to send photos, snaps from Memories, Bitmoji stickers and more). Chats sent in groups are automatically deleted after 24 hours.

 

Snaps: When you take a new photo or video snap through the camera tab, you can select the group name from your friends list to send it to everyone in the group.

 

Video Chat: You can start video chatting with up to 15 friends in a group from the group chat.
