It is also one of the only media players which helps you run files of AC3 and AAC format. You can control the media player with the help of gestures, and it is the only app that supports codec for Android.

### Methods for downloading and installing MX player on PC:
 
#### Method (1) – Using Android Emulators.
 
Now, before we talk about the ways to use an android emulator, we need an MX player APK file. MX Player APK file can be downloaded directly on your PC using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, or you can download it on your phone and then transfer it to your PC. The file is safe and does not have any virus or unwanted cookies attached to it. 
 
Now, as we have talked about emulators so often, you must be wondering what an emulator is? An emulator is a tool that enables you to run android apps on your PC. Some of these emulators are free and can be easily downloaded or bought from a local nearby hardware store. 
 
Now there are various emulators out there in the market such as Bluestack, Memu, Non-player. Here we are going to talk about installing an MX player on your PC using Bluestack emulator. 
 
Follow the steps given below to install an MX player on your PC using Bluestack emulator.
 
Step 1: Download and install bluestacks emulator on your PC. The procedure is simple and is the same as when you download any other file from the web browser and install it. 
 

 
Step 2: Once you have successfully installed the emulator, open it, and in the Home tab, go to the App Centre.
 
Step 3: In the app center, you need to search for the MX player APK file you downloaded earlier and directly install it from here. 
 
Step 4: Accept all the permissions, and just like installing an app on the Android, install it on your PC. 
 
Et Voila! Your PC is now ready to browse videos with your latest MX player media player. We preferred Bluestack emulator over any other emulator because, in any other emulator, you would have to sideload the MX player APK file.

Just like emulators, for installing MX player using Remix OS too, you will first need to download the MX player APK file as discussed in method 1.
