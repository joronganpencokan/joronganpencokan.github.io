# Never Be Caught With A Dead Device Again! Learn This Easy Trick to Keep Track of Your Battery Levels

We've all been there - in the middle of an important phone call or trying to finish a crucial email, and our device unexpectedly dies. It's a frustrating experience that can be prevented with just a little bit of preparation. By learning how to keep track of your battery levels, you'll never be caught with a dead device again.

Here's an easy trick to keep your battery levels in check:

1. **Turn on Battery Percentage**

Your device should have an option to turn on battery percentage, which will display the exact percentage of battery life remaining. This feature is usually found in the settings menu, under "Battery" or "Display and brightness." Once you've turned on battery percentage, you'll be able to see exactly how much battery life your device has left.

2. **Set Battery Life Alerts**

Many devices allow you to set battery life alerts, which will give you a notification when your battery level reaches a certain percentage. This is a great way to remind yourself to charge your device before it dies completely. To set up alerts, go to the settings menu and look for the "Battery" or "Notifications" section.

3. **Use Battery Saving Modes**

Most devices now come with battery-saving modes, which can significantly extend your battery life. These modes adjust your device's settings to conserve power, such as dimming the screen or turning off background apps. Experiment with these modes to see which ones work best for your usage patterns.

4. **Carry a Portable Charger**

If all else fails, carrying a portable charger with you can be a lifesaver. These chargers are small and easy to carry in a pocket or purse, and they can charge your device on-the-go. Make sure you choose a charger with enough capacity to fully charge your device at least once.

By following these simple steps, you'll be able to keep track of your battery levels and avoid the frustration of a dead device. Whether you're running errands or traveling, these tips will ensure that you always have enough power to stay connected.
