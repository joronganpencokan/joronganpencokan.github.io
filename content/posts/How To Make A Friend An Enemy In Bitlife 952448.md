# 10 Shocking Steps to Turn Your Best Friend into Your WORST Enemy in Bitlife!

So, you’ve been friends with your BFF for years, but now you want to spice things up in Bitlife by turning your closest ally into your fiercest rival. No worries – we’ve got you covered! Follow these 10 shocking steps and watch as your best friend transforms into your worst enemy.

1. Start spreading rumors

Nothing destroys a relationship faster than vicious rumors. Start spreading false gossip about your best friend and watch as the trust dissolves. Make sure to target weak spots – is your BFF insecure about their relationship, appearance, or job? Find a way to exploit it.

2. Constantly belittle them

No one likes to be put down all the time. So, take every opportunity to belittle your best friend’s accomplishments, ideas, or opinions. Make them feel inferior and incapable, and they’ll start to resent you.

3. Steal their significant other

This one is a classic. If your best friend has a significant other, make a move on them. Try to seduce them, and if they show interest, go ahead and start a relationship. Your former best friend will be outraged and will have no choice but to cut ties with you.

4. Sabotage their career

Is your BFF getting ahead in their career? Not for long! Start sabotaging their efforts – spread negative feedback about their work or steal their ideas and pass them off as your own. Soon enough, your best friend will be stuck in a dead-end job while you flourish.

5. Sleep with their family members

This one may seem extreme, but it’s sure to get the desired effect. Sleep with your best friend’s sibling, parent, or even grandparent. Nothing hurts more than betrayal from a family member, and your best friend will be seething with anger.

6. Steal their inheritance

If your best friend is set to inherit a large sum of money, don’t let them have it. Find a way to manipulate the will or contest it in court. When your BFF loses their inheritance, they’ll blame you for it.

7. Ruin their friendships

Is your best friend close with other people? Find a way to isolate them from their friends. Spread false rumors, create conflict, or try to take over their social circle. With no friends left, your former BFF will be dependent on you – just the way you want it.

8. Steal their partner’s affections

If your best friend is in a happy relationship, try to steal their partner’s affections. Flirt with them, spend as much time with them as possible, and try to create a connection. Soon enough, your best friend’s partner will leave them for you, and your former BFF will be devastated.

9. Get them fired

Is your best friend excelling at their job? Find a way to get them fired. Spread false rumors or create a conflict with their boss. When your best friend loses their job, they’ll be resentful towards you for sabotaging their career.

10. Betray them in public

Finally, the ultimate betrayal – turn against your best friend in public. Make sure to humiliate them in front of their peers or strangers. Call them out for something they did wrong or shame them for their mistakes. Your former BFF will never forgive you for the public embarrassment.

Congratulations! You’ve successfully turned your best friend into your worst enemy. Keep these shocking steps in mind for your next Bitlife playthrough and watch as relationships crumble under your manipulation.

Do you want to turn your friend into an enemy in Bitlife? Well, the life simulator does emulate real life and is a pretty similar process overall. So, let’s find out how to make a friend an enemy in the game.
 
## How to turn a friend into an enemy in Bitlife?
 
To make your friend an enemy you will have to commit various hostile acts to the specific person. These hostile acts can include abusing your friend. You can also spread rumors about a specific friend to get them to hate you. Doing so will make you hate them and they will declare you as an enemy.
 
However, it is never so easy now, is it? You will have to go the extra step and make a lot of friends in the game. This is because even if you do commit hostile acts against a person chances are that they will initially unfriend you rather than declare you an enemy. So make sure you accept every friend request that you will come across in the game so that you have a good enough base even if you have just a minor falling out with one friend.
 
Another thing you can do is make sure you turn all your classmates into friends when you are in school. You can access them via the classmates’ list while you are in school.
 
Now, with all the preliminaries done all you need to do is put on your mean face and start acting cold. Spreading rumors and hurling insults are the best way to turn someone into your enemy. However, you do need to remember that not everyone will become an enemy. Some will simply unfriend you. So, all you have to do is keep trying.
