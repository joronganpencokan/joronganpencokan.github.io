Protect Your Linux System From Hackers With This Simple Vulnerability Scanner Installation Guide!

Do you want to keep your Linux system secure and free from hackers? If yes, then you should consider installing a vulnerability scanner on your system. Vulnerability scanners can help you to identify any vulnerabilities in your system and take necessary actions to fix them.

Here’s a simple vulnerability scanner installation guide that you can follow to protect your Linux system from hackers.

Step 1: Update Your System

Before you start with the installation process, make sure to update your Linux system. Use the following command in your terminal to update your system:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

This command will update your system packages and install new security patches.

Step 2: Install OpenVAS

OpenVAS is a free and open-source vulnerability scanner that can help you to identify any vulnerabilities in your system. Use the following command to install OpenVAS on your Linux system:

sudo apt install openvas -y

Step 3: Configure OpenVAS

After installing OpenVAS, you need to configure it to start using it. Use the following command to configure OpenVAS:

sudo openvas-setup

This command will start the OpenVAS setup wizard, which will guide you through the configuration process. Make sure to choose the appropriate options according to your system requirements.

Step 4: Start OpenVAS Services

After the configuration process, you need to start the OpenVAS services. Use the following command to start OpenVAS services:

sudo systemctl start openvas-scanner && sudo systemctl start openvas-manager && sudo systemctl start openvas-gsa

This command will start the OpenVAS scanner, manager, and web interface services. Now, you can access the OpenVAS web interface to start scanning your system for vulnerabilities.

Step 5: Start Scanning Your System

To start scanning your system, open your web browser and go to the following URL:

https://localhost:9392

This URL will take you to the OpenVAS web interface. Log in using the default credentials (username: admin, password: admin), and start scanning your system.

Conclusion

By installing a vulnerability scanner on your Linux system, you can identify any vulnerabilities in your system and take necessary actions to fix them. OpenVAS is a free and open-source vulnerability scanner that you can install on your Linux system. Follow this simple vulnerability scanner installation guide to protect your Linux system from hackers.

One of the greatest things about Linux is the amount of open source tools at your disposal, although they might not be installed. In this how-to, we will install OpenVas, an open-source vulnerability scanning and management application, and then run your first vulnerability scan.
 
First things first, we have to choose our base Linux distro. This walkthrough will use Ubuntu. Some other distros, such as Kali Linux, may already have it installed.
 
In addition to our Ubuntu installation we will need to choose which version of OpenVas we will be working with. Currently, there are three versions in circulation. For this tutorial we will be using the newest – the Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) version 10. To read more details on OpenVas or GVM, they can be found here.
 
## Getting Started
 
In order to begin the installation of GVM, we also will need to install the proper required repository, which GVM is dependent on. To do this we will begin opening a terminal session by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T and run the following command:
 
The output of the above command will give text-based instruction for GVM but also give you optional instructions.
 
## Updating Your Ubuntu Installation
 
Starting with a fresh installation of Ubuntu 18.04, we will want to make sure that we are fully updated. To do this, run the following command:
 
## Installation of OpenVas
 
At this point, we are ready to install GVM. The default database used for GVM is SQLite. If you prefer another database for use with this solution, you can find additional instructions at the link provided above.
 
To install GVM, run the following:
 
During your installation, you will be prompted with additional configuration steps:
 
To configure the Unix Socket, select “Yes.”
 

 
To configure GVMD-sqlite, select “Yes.”
 
To configure GVMD-sqlite-cert, select “Yes.”
 
To configure GVMD-sqlite-scap, select “Yes.”
 
When the installation completes, the final step is to update the greenbone nvt/cert/scap data with the following set of commands:
 
## Running Your First scan
 
Congratulations on completing the installation of GVM – now the fun begins. First, to give ourselves the warm fuzzies, let’s check the status of our installation. All properly-running applications should show a green dot or ‘active’ status when run. We can do that by launching the following-
 
GVM gives users the ability to use a Web interface. To access the Web interface, navigate your web browser to:
 
Login with the following credentials:
 
Once logged in using the admin credentials, we can now set up our first scan. To do this, select “Scan -> Tasks” from the application menu.
 
Then from the task window, find the ‘wand’ icon and select Task Wizard.
 
When the Task Wizard window appears, we will enter the IP address of our host. Since we are only using one machine, we will scan our local host. To do this, confirm that 127.0.0.1 is entered. If not, manually enter it in the space provided.
 
Click “Start Scan” and wait. This may take a few minutes, depending on whether you used a fresh install of Ubuntu or an existing machine.
 
Once the scan has completed, you will see a page similar to the following notifications.
 
Now to see your results, go to “Scans -> Reports.” Due to the fact that this is a new test machine, my results have no findings. If you run a scan on an existing machine on your company or home network, you may have different results.
 
To conclude, we have just hit the tip of the iceberg in what GVM can do for finding system vulnerabilities. I challenge you to configure different scans and uncover things you may not have known existed. You will be surprised at what you find, I guarantee. Happy Scanning!
