### Other Photo And Camera Tricks On iOS
 
iOS devices are always so much fun to explore. Other than the unlimited iPhone photo zooming trick, there are various other tricks that you can perform on your iOS device using your camera and Photos app. There might be a chance that you haven’t explored these tricks yet, so here is the list of some of them.
 
1. Measuring Objects: If you don’t have access to tapes and other measuring equipment but need to measure some object, your iPhone can help you in that case. Using the Measure app, you can measure any object easily.
 
2. Document Scanner: Using your iPhone you can easily scan any document and keep them safe in your photo library. For that, you need to launch the Notes app on your device. Then tap on + icon and select Scan Documents.
 
3. Magnifier: Yes, it’s correct, your iPhone camera can also act as a magnifying glass. Just turn on the Magnifier option under the Accessibility, and it’s done. Now all you need to do is a triple tap on the home button to launch the magnifier.
 
4. Search In Photos: Do you find it difficult to locate photos in your library? If yes, then this one is for you. Using the search option in the photos, you can locate any photo by just giving your iPhone a hint about that photo. For example, if your photo has a watch in it, just type watch in the search box, and all the photos related to it will appear.
 
5. 3D Touch Camera: Now this one is a bit like a shortcut button. If you press the camera button hard (3D Touch – a bit different than long-pressing and is available on iPhone 6S and later) on your iOS device, it will open up the options like Take Selfie and Record Video. This trick is quite interesting because it is really known by less number of people.
