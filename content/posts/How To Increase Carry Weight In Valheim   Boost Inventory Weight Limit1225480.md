#Unlock the Secret to Expanding Your Inventory Capacity in Valheim with these Carry Weight Hacks!

Are you tired of constantly running out of inventory space in Valheim? Are you struggling to gather resources and carry them all back to your base camp? If so, you're not alone. Many players find themselves limited by a low carry weight, but there are ways to increase it. In this article, we'll be discussing some of the best carry weight hacks for Valheim.

## Carry Weight Explained

Before we dive into the hacks, let's quickly discuss carry weight in Valheim. Simply put, carry weight is how much weight your character can carry at any given time. As you collect resources like wood and stone, your carry weight will begin to fill up. Once you reach your maximum capacity, you won't be able to collect any more resources until you've brought some back to your base camp and dropped them off.

## Hacks for Increasing Carry Weight

Now, let's explore some ways you can increase your carry weight in Valheim. 

### 1. Use a Cart

One of the easiest ways to increase your carry weight is by using a cart. You can build a cart using wood and iron, and it will allow you to carry a significant amount of resources. You can also add more carts to your base camp to increase your storage space.

### 2. Upgrade Your Inventory

Another way to increase your carry weight is by upgrading your inventory. You can do this by crafting upgraded bags, like the Reinforced Iron Chest or the Lox Cape, that give you more storage space. The Lox Cape can be obtained by killing Loxes, which are found in the Plains biome.

### 3. Choose Your Armor Wisely

When choosing your armor in Valheim, it's important to consider how it affects your carry weight. Some armor sets, like the Lox Cape or the Wolf Armor, provide a carry weight bonus. Wearing these sets can increase your carry weight and allow you to carry more resources.

### 4. Eat Food and Drink Mead

Certain foods and drinks in Valheim can give you a temporary boost to your carry weight. For example, the Honey Mead, which is brewed using honey and raspberries, will give you a +20 carry weight bonus for 10 minutes. Additionally, eating cooked meat will restore your stamina, allowing you to carry more weight without slowing down.

### 5. Level Up Your Skills

Finally, leveling up certain skills can also increase your carry weight. The most important skill for this is the Strength skill, which will increase your maximum carry weight by 5 for every level gained. Other skills that indirectly affect your carry weight include the Jump skill, which allows you to jump higher and therefore reach more resources, and the Run skill, which increases your movement speed.

## Conclusion

These are just a few hacks for increasing your carry weight in Valheim. By using these tips and tricks, you'll be able to carry more resources and gather materials more efficiently. Remember to consider your armor, food, and skills when trying to increase your carry weight, and don't forget the power of a good cart. Happy adventuring!
