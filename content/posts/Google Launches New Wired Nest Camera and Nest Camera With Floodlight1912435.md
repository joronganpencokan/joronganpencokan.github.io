# You Won't Believe the Amazing New Features of Google's Latest Nest Cameras

If you're in the market for a home security system, you'll want to check out Google's latest Nest cameras. With their advanced features, you can enjoy peace of mind knowing your home is always protected. Here are just some of the incredible benefits you'll get with the new Nest cameras.

## Floodlights

One of the standout features of the new Nest cameras is the built-in floodlights. These bright lights are designed to deter intruders and light up your property at night. The camera's motion detection system activates the floodlights, making it perfect for anyone who wants to keep their home safe and secure. Not only that, but the floodlights are also powerful enough to light up your entire yard, or the outside of your house, which can make it easier for you to see if someone is lurking around in the dark.

## Wired Options

Another new addition to the Nest camera lineup is the wired option. Unlike wireless cameras, which rely on Wi-Fi to work, wired cameras use a physical connection to maintain connectivity. This means that you don't have to worry about signal dropouts, weak spots, or slow internet speeds when using a wired camera. Additionally, wired cameras also come with a number of benefits, such as power and reliability, which make them an excellent choice for those who want top-of-the-line security.

## Smart Features

Finally, Google's new Nest cameras also boast a range of smart features. For example, the cameras use facial recognition to distinguish family members from strangers, and can also send you real-time alerts when someone enters your property. Additionally, the cameras can be set to turn on automatically when you leave the house, so you can monitor your home even when you're not there. With their powerful features, Google's Nest cameras take the guesswork out of home security.

## Conclusion

Overall, Google's new Nest cameras are an excellent choice for anyone who wants to keep their home safe and secure. With features like floodlights, wired options, and facial recognition technology, you can trust that your home is always protected. Don't wait – explore Google's Nest cameras today and see for yourself why they are the best option for home security.

Google's two latest Nest cameras are now available to buy in the Google Store. One is a budget-friendly wired option, while the other is an outdoor security camera with a floodlight.

 

The devices are part of a major refresh for the Nest line Google announced earlier this year. The company released an indoor/outdoor battery-powered Nest camera in August, along with a battery-powered Nest doorbell. They were the first Nest products to come out since the Hello doorbell in 2018.

 

The new Google Nest Cam with Floodlight costs $280 and can replace an existing exterior light or wiring. The LED floodlight uses both 180-degree motion sensors and the camera's smart technology to determine when and what it lights up. You even can select the kinds of activity you want it to capture, which is handy if you don't want it to turn on every time the neighbor's cat enters your yard.

 

The Nest Cam with floodlight works exclusively with the Google Home app and provides a 24/7 video feed in 1080p with HDR if you have a Nest Aware Plus subscription. Even without the subscription, you can use the Home app to create Activity Zones, set up routines, and back up about an hour of footage to the device, itself, in case your power or internet goes out.

 

Meanwhile, the new wired Nest Cam starts at $100 and comes in four different colors—Snow, Linen, Fog, and Sand with maple wood base—which is a feature other smart home security cameras don't offer. Google says the camera has "10 times more machine learning power" than the previous Nest generation devices. It also comes three hours of video history in HDR quality, the ability to create Activity Zones, and local storage backup.
