# Unlock the Secret to Affordable Airtag Attachment - Keep Your Belongings Safe & Secure!

Have you ever lost your keys, wallet, or luggage? Losing important belongings can be frustrating and can cause a lot of inconvenience. But what if we told you that you could easily keep track of your belongings and find them quickly in case they get lost? Yes, it is possible with the Apple AirTag.

The Apple AirTag is a small, circular tracker that you can attach to your belongings to keep track of them using the Find My app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. It uses Bluetooth technology to communicate with nearby Apple devices and helps you locate your lost items on a map.

However, the AirTag on its own is not enough to keep your belongings safe and secure. You need an attachment that will keep the AirTag in place and ensure that it doesn't fall off. This is where the affordable AirTag attachment comes into play.

There are various types of attachments available in the market, ranging from keychain holders to luggage tags. However, many of these attachments are quite expensive and can burn a hole in your pocket. But don't worry, we have unlocked the secret to affordable AirTag attachments that will keep your belongings safe and secure.

Here are some affordable AirTag attachment options that you can consider:

1. Silicone Cases - Silicone cases are one of the most affordable AirTag attachment options available in the market. They come in various colors and designs, and you can easily attach them to your belongings with a ring or clip. Silicone cases provide a good grip and ensure that the AirTag stays in place.

2. Keychain Holders - Keychain holders are another affordable option to attach your AirTag to your keys. They come in various designs and materials such as leather, metal, and silicone. They are lightweight and easy to carry around.

3. Luggage Tags - If you are looking for an AirTag attachment option for your luggage, then luggage tags are a great option. They come in various sizes and materials such as leather, plastic, and silicone. They are durable and easy to attach to your luggage.

4. Pet Collars - If you want to use AirTag to track your pet, then you can attach it to your pet's collar with a pet collar attachment. Pet collar attachments come in various sizes and designs, so you can choose the one that best fits your pet.

In conclusion, AirTag is a great way to keep track of your belongings, and with affordable AirTag attachments, you can ensure that your belongings are safe and secure. Whether you need an attachment for your keys, luggage, or pet, there are plenty of affordable options available in the market.

Just this morning, I used an AirTag to track down my keys.
Keys which turned out to be in my pocket
But how do you attach the petite white flying saucer to your keys?
Also: How to hide an Apple AirTag on your bike (and why you should)
Apple's suggestion is that you use one of its AirTag holders. Perhaps the $35 leather key ring tag, or a $29 silicone loop, or maybe you want to treat yourself to a $349 Hermès key ring holder.
I don't know about you, but I'm reluctant to pay $35 for a holder for an AirTag that costs $29.
I've dabbled with cheap – and I mean like $2 cheap – silicone AirTag holders, but they've let me down in that the AirTag can pop out, and the silicone starts to tear after a few weeks of use.
I don't recommend these.
Buy cheap, buy twice.
I've been testing a few different holders and have found some that are both good quality and reasonably priced.
The Unbreakcable Nu Series protective AirTag case is one of them. 
This AirTag case is made from highly durable TPU, and features a clear protective front cover to improve protection and prevent the AirTag from rattling about. 
And to make it easy to attach your AirTag to things – keys, luggage, pets – there's a sturdy metal clip. Made of an aluminum alloy, this clip is lightweight yet strong and corrosion resistant.
The case doesn't reduce the range that the AirTag can be detected and has very little effect on the beeps that a lost AirTag emits to help you find it.
Unbreakcable also claims that the cases are waterproof to IP56, but given that AirTags have a rating of IP67, the purpose of this seems to be to prevent dirt, dust, and moisture from entering the case.
They're also easy to use. Pop the case out of the pack and remove the clear front cover.
Then remove the packing piece that keeps the case from being crushed in transit.
Pop the AirTag into the TPU case. It's quite a tight fit!
Finally, pop the cover on, and finish up with the ring!
And best of all, priced at $21.99 for a pack of four, the Unbreakcable Nu Series protective AirTag case four-pack costs less than a single AirTag.
