# Unbelievable! Learn the Secret Trick to Save Whatsapp Statuses without Screenshots!

Are you tired of taking screenshots of your favorite Whatsapp statuses just to save and share them with your friends? Well, no need to worry anymore! We've got you covered with a secret trick to save Whatsapp statuses without the hassle of taking screenshots.

First, let's start by explaining what Whatsapp statuses are. These are short-lived photos and videos that users can post on their profiles for their contacts to view. They are available for 24 hours before getting automatically deleted unless saved or shared by the user.

So how can you save these statuses without taking screenshots?

Step 1: Download a File Manager App

File Manager apps are essential tools that allow you to view and manage files on your phone. There are several options available on your app store, including ES File Explorer, Solid Explorer, and others. Install one of these apps on your device if you haven't already.

Step 2: Locate the Whatsapp Media Folder

Using the file manager app, locate the folder that contains media files for Whatsapp. Different devices may have different directory structures, but most of them store WhatsApp media in the following path:

WhatsApp > Media > .Statuses

Typically, the ".Statuses" folder is hidden by default, so you may need to enable the option to show hidden files in your file manager app.

Step 3: Save the Status

Once you locate the ".Statuses" folder, open it, and you will see all the recent statuses posted by your contacts. Select the status you want to save and copy it to your device's internal storage or SD card. Doing this will save it permanently on your device, even after the 24-hour period expires.

Step 4: Share the Status

Now that you have saved the desired status, you can easily share it with your friends on other social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. Simply open the media file on your device's gallery and share it via your preferred social media platform.

Conclusion

This secret trick is the easiest and most efficient way to save Whatsapp statuses without the hassle of taking screenshots. With just a few clicks, you can save your favorite statuses, share them with friends and make sure they never disappear after the 24-hour period. Remember, always respect your contact's privacy, and do not save or share statuses that are intended to be private. Happy saving!
