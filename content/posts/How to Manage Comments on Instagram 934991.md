# Are you tired of dealing with negative comments on Instagram? Discover the foolproof guide to managing comments like a pro!

If you’re an Instagram user, you’ve probably dealt with your fair share of negative comments. Whether it’s trolls, haters, or just plain rude people, it can be frustrating and exhausting to deal with negativity day in and day out. But fear not! We're here to provide a foolproof guide to managing comments like a pro.

## Step 1: Don't Panic

The first rule of managing negative comments is to stay calm. Don't let rude comments get the best of you. Remember that not everyone will like what you post or say, and that's okay. It's also essential to accept that you can't control what people say in the comments section.

## Step 2: Respond Strategically

When you see negative comments, you have a few options. You can ignore them or delete them, but we recommend responding strategically. Responding to negative comments shows that you're attentive to your followers and care about their feedback. Here are a few tips on how to respond:

- Be polite and professional.
- Acknowledge the negative comment and understand their perspective.
- Apologize if necessary and offer a solution.
- Ask questions if you're not sure what they're trying to say.
- Don't argue or engage in a back-and-forth conversation.

By responding in a strategic way, you can turn negative comments into positive opportunities for engagement and build trust with your followers.

## Step 3: Use Filters

Instagram has a filtering system that allows you to block specific keywords or phrases. This is a useful tool to prevent spam, hate speech or trolling. To use filters:

- Go to "Settings" -> "Privacy" -> "Comments"
- Enable "Hide Offensive Comments"
- Add specific keywords or phrases under "Filter keywords."

Filters don't eliminate negative comments altogether, but they help to minimize them.

## Step 4: Foster a Positive Community

Finally, the best way to manage negative comments is to create a positive community. Encourage your followers to share their experiences or engage with them regularly. Make sure to respond to positive comments as well; this shows that you value their support and appreciation.

Additionally, you can create guidelines for your community to follow, such as no hate speech, no spam, and no abusive language. Make it clear that negative comments will not be tolerated so that your followers can understand your expectations and know what is acceptable.

In conclusion, managing negative comments on Instagram is not easy, but it’s not impossible either. By following these steps, you can manage comments like a pro without letting them get the best of you. Remember to stay calm, responds strategically, use filters, and foster a positive community. Good luck!

Instagram is one of the most popular social networks. The app quickly rose to prominence by focusing on allowing its users to easily share images as well as videos. Of course, writing comments is a big part of the whole experience. This tutorial takes a look at all the ways you can use comments on Instagram to get the most out of the app.
 
## Commenting on Posts
 
Commenting on posts is the oldest form of interaction on Instagram. Whether you’re browsing via the mobile app or a PC, here’s all you need to know about commenting on Instagram posts.
 
## 1. How to Comment on an Instagram Post
 
Writing a comment on Instagram is easy. On mobile, just find the chat bubble under a post and tap it. Alternatively, you can scroll down toward the bottom of the post and tap on the “Add a comment” prompt next to your profile picture.
 
Notice that every comment on a post has a tiny “Reply” button underneath. Hit it if you want to respond directly to something that someone has said. The replies will form a sub-thread that will be displayed underneath the main comment.
 
You have the same options on desktop as described above.
 
## 2. How to Delete Post Comments on Instagram
 
It happens: you’ve changed your mind about posting a particular comment. This can happen for various reasons. Perhaps you’ve inadvertently managed to offend someone with your opinion or decided to simply retreat from a heated conversation. Here’s how to delete your own comments on Instagram. In addition, note the you can also delete other people’s comments on your OWN posts by following the same steps. 
 
### Mobile
 
- Find the comment you wish to get rid of in the mobile app.Long-press on the comment and tap on the Trash icon at the top.

 
- The comment will be deleted.You’ll be given a brief window to undo your action and bring the comment back by pressing on the “Undo” button that appears at the bottom next to the “Comment deleted” message.

 
### Desktop
 
- If you want to delete your Instagram comment from PC, go to the post in question and find the comment.Hover your mouse over the comment to bring up the three dots next to the “Reply” button mentioned above and click on it.

 
- Select “Delete” from the pop-up window that appears.

 
- Be careful when deleting comments on your computer, as there is no option to “Undo.”

 
## 3. How to Hide Comments on Instagram 
 
It’s possible to hide someone’s comments on Instagram by restricting them. If you decide to use this tool on a certain account, they will still be able to comment on your posts, but their impressions won’t be public for the world to see. What’s more, they won’t know they’ve been restricted, so if you don’t want to confront someone about their comments on your posts, restricting them is the way to go. Restricting someone directly from the comment section can only be done on mobile.
 
- Find the comment you wish to get rid of in the mobile app.Long press on it and tap on the message icon (with an exclamation point in the middle) at the top.

 
- Select “Restrict X.”

 
- Instagram will alert you that you’re about to restrict someone and will also give you the option to delete the comment. You may want to take that option, as the comment they have already posted on your profile won’t be affected by the “Restrict” option.

 
- The next comment they leave, however, will be hidden from your view on your profile. You will have to tap on “See comment” under the text to see it.

 
- Tap “Approve” to allow everyone who visits your profile to view it. Alternatively, you can just delete it. But if you don’t want the other person to realize their comments are being prevented from showing up on your posts (they can check your posts), you can just keep them hidden.If you wish to unrestrict someone, go back to their hidden comment and tap on it.Select the message icon again and select the “Unrestrict X” option from the menu that pops up from the bottom.

 
While it’s not possible to restrict someone from your PC, you can view restricted comments while browsing Instagram on your computer. You’ll get the same “See comment” and “Approve” or “Delete” options to manage them from there.
 
## 4. How to Restrict Someone Before They Comment
 
You don’t have to wait for someone to comment on your posts to restrict them. If you want to avoid someone sharing their thoughts on your images publicly, you can put them on your restricted list. You have various methods of doing so.
 
### From Settings
 
- On your Instagram profile in the app, tap on the hamburger menu in the upper-right corner.

 
- Tap on “Settings.”

 
- Select “Privacy.”

 
- Scroll down until you reach the “Connections” section and tap on “Restricted accounts.”

 
- Use the search bar at the top to find the contact in question. It can be someone you don’t even follow. If you know their Instagram username, you can easily find them.

 
- Once you’ve identified them, press “Restrict.”

 
- They’ve now been added to your Restricted list. From here you can easily unrestrict them by pressing the “Unrestrict” button next to their name.

 
### Directly from Their Profile
 
You can also restrict someone directly from their profile on both mobile and desktop. 
 
- Access the commenter’s profile on mobile or PC.Tap on the three dots in the upper-right corner.

 
- Select the “Restrict” option from the menu that appears (at the bottom on mobile).

 
### From Direct Messages
 
You can also restrict a person via direct messages on mobile. Find the conversation in question and tap on their profile picture at the top to bring up the details regarding their account. Select the “Restrict” option from there. 
 
## 5. How to Automatically Hide Offensive Comments
 
Do you want to make sure your followers won’t leave offensive comments on your profile? Instagram offers you the option to hide offensive comments from “Settings.” 
 
- On your mobile device, access “Settings” as shown above.Go to “Privacy.”Select “Hidden Words.”

 
- Here you have various options for filtering comments, starting with “Hide comments.” This option hides comments that may be offensive in a separate section of your posts, reels, lives, etc.

 
- “Advanced comment filtering” hides additional comments that may contain offensive words and phrases.In the lower part of the display, you can set up a custom list containing certain words and phrases that will be blacklisted.

 
- You can then opt to “Hide comments” containing any of these words and phrases.

 
- On desktop, you also have a few options to hide offensive words. Go to Settings by tapping on your profile image in the upper-right corner.

 
- Select “Privacy and Security.”

 
- Scroll down and click on “Edit Comment Settings.”From this screen you can create your own custom list of keywords to be banned from your profile.

 
- In addition, there’s also the “Use Default Keywords” option, which you can use to hide comments that contain commonly reported keywords from your posts.

 
## 6. How to Prevent Certain People from Commenting on Your Posts
 
If you really don’t want to see someone comment on your posts on Instagram but are also skittish about blocking them for good, know that it’s possible to only block their comments.
 
- Go back to “Settings” in your Instagram app on your smartphone.Go to “Privacy.”Select “Comments.”

 
- Select the “Block Comments From” option.

 
- Input the name of the accounts you wish to prevent from commenting on your posts by using the search bar. Once you do this, the comments submitted by these particular accounts will only be visible to them.

 
- All blocked commenters will be shown here as part of a list. You can easily unblock them by pressing the “Unblock” button next to their name.

 
If the person in question comments on your posts, you might view the “1 Comment” message below your post, but if you press on it, you won’t be able to see the comment. Note that if you block someone from commenting on your posts, that doesn’t mean they won’t be able to view your profile or send you direct messages. As stated above, this is a lighter alternative to actually blocking someone on Instagram.
 
The other option you have at your disposal in the Comments section in Settings is “Allow Comments From.” Your choices include “People You Follow,” “Your Followers” and others. This lets you be a bit more specific about which people are allowed to leave you comments, hopefully weeding out the unwanted voices.
 
- You can only take advantage of the “Allow Comments From” feature on desktop. Do so by opening Settings again.Select “Privacy & Security” from the right.

 
- Click on “Comments Controls.”Select “Allow Comments From” and pick your desired option.

 
## 7. How to Turn Off Comments Altogether
 
Don’t want to deal with comments AT ALL? It can be done. From your mobile device you can disable comments for individual posts so that you won’t receive unsolicited feedback anymore.
 
- Navigate to one of your posts on Instagram and open it.Tap on the three dots in the upper-right corner of the display.

 
- Select “Turn off commenting.”If you look at your post, it will say “Comments are off” underneath it.

 
- At the same time, you can also tap on “Review controls” to easily tweak these settings.

 
- For instance, you can opt to “Allow comments from” or change the “Privacy Settings.”Alternatively, you can “Turn on commenting” again, if you have a change of heart. It’s also possible to turn off comments for a new post while you’re creating it. On your Instagram feed, tap on the “+” button in the top right corner and select “Post.”

 
- Upload your content and proceed to the posting screen. Select “Advanced Settings” at the bottom.

 
- In the next window, toggle off “Turn off commenting” for this post.

 
- On PC, it’s only possible to disable commenting when creating a new post. The other option is limited to mobile. Start by clicking on the “+” button in the top-right corner to upload your content.

 
- Once on the posting screen, tap on “Advanced Settings” on the right and toggle it off “Turn off commenting.”

 
Unfortunately, Instagram does not offer an option to disable commenting altogether, so you’ll need to do so manually for each post. Note that you can turn off commenting for YOUR posts only and not for other people’s posts.
 
## Commenting via Direct Messages
 
Direct messages are a different way to comment on Instagram. Let’s say you’ve noticed a particular post on Instagram.
