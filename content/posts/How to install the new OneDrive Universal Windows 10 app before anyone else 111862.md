Since Microsoft stopped the development of the modern version of OneDrive and made the bold move of removing placeholders for Windows 10, users have been patiently waiting for the release Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app of the popular cloud storage service.
 
While the software giant is planning to release the OneDrive app for Windows 10 sometime during the second quarter of 2016, WindowsBlogItalia had the chance to get their hands on an early build of the app and published the instructions on how users can give it a try.
 
In this guide, you’ll learn the steps to sideload the new OneDrive Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app on your PC. Just keep in mind that that app will only load on the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview builds.
 
## How to install the new OneDrive app for Windows 10
 
- Download the early version of the OneDrive UWP app for Windows 10 using this source link.
 - Warning: You’ll be downloading and installing a version of a Windows app that it hasn’t been published from Microsoft yet, and you’ll be using a third-party source, which is not always recommended. Use the files and use this guide at your own risk. You’ve been warned!
 - Unzip the files on the Downloads folder. The password to extract the files is windowsblogitalia-u7ybvcdm. (You can use 7zip to extract the password protected files.)
 - Use the Windows key + I keyboard shortcut to open the Settings app.
 - Click Update & security.
 - Click For developers.
 - Click Developer mode.
 - On the prompt Activate developer mode? Click Yes.
 - Open Start, do a search for Windows PowerShell, right-click the result, and select Run as administrator.
 - Type the following command and press Enter:
 - Add-AppxPackage C:\Users\your-user-name\Downloads\onedrive-UWP.appxbundle
 - Wait for the installation complete and open the app.

 
Once you have completed the installation, you can start using the OneDrive Universal app, but consider that it’s still under development, as such bugs and errors are expected.

If you have used OneDrive on your Android or Windows phone, you already know what to expect from the desktop version of the app. The UI is close identical to the mobile app. You can get access to all your files through placeholders, there is a navigation bar on the left with access to All files, Photos, Recent documents, Shared, Recycle bin, and you also have the ability to add new accounts.
 
You will also find a Progress page to view current downloads and uploads of files.
 
The Settings page is very basic and at this time there is no settings you can configure.
 
As you would expect, you also get the a few options to create a new folder, short files, select, and add files. Unfortunately, some of these features are not working well at this time.
 
Also, you can double-click an image to view, you get the options to delete, download, and share, but you’ll need to restart the app to exit the preview mode.
 
While the OneDrive Universal Windows Platform app isn’t complete, this version gives us an early look of what’s to come when the company releases the app to everyone.
