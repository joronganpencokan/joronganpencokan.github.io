In the game Hades, players can take control of Zagreus, his son, and battle their way through the various levels of the underworld. To emerge victorious, players must have the right Hades builds and boons to unleash the full power of the god of the underworld.

Unstoppable Hades Boons

Boons are an essential part of any Hades build. Here are some of the best boons to unleash hell.

1. Aphrodite’s Aid
This boon provides temporary invincibility and increased damage. It can be a lifesaver in tough situations.

2. Athena’s Dash
This boon provides a shield aura when you dash, making you invulnerable to attacks. It’s perfect for dodging attacks and closing the gap between you and your enemies.

3. Zeus’ Lightning Bolt
This boon provides a powerful lightning attack that can deal massive damage to enemies. It works well with any build that focuses on dealing damage.

4. Dionysus’ Hangover
This boon inflicts damage over time on enemies, making it perfect for builds that focus on using the cast ability.
