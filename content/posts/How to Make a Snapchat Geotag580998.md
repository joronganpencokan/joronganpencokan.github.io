Are you tired of blending in with the crowd on social media? Do you want to add a personal touch to your Snapchat stories? Look no further than creating your own Snapchat geotag!

Geotags are location-based graphics that appear on Snapchat when a user takes a photo or video within the designated area. These geotags can be created by anyone and are a great way to add a unique touch to your snaps.

Creating a Snapchat geotag is easier than you might think. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. Design your geotag

Before you begin creating your geotag, you'll need to design it. Think about what represents you or your brand and how you want to showcase that on Snapchat. You can use free design software such as Canva or PicMonkey to create your geotag. Just make sure it meets Snapchat's guidelines, which can be found on their website.

2. Create a Snapchat account

If you don't already have a Snapchat account, create one by downloading the app to your phone and signing up.

3. Go to Create a Geofilter

Once you have an account in Snapchat, you'll need to go to "Create a Geofilter" on the Snapchat website. This page will guide you through the process of creating a geotag. 

4. Upload your design

After you click on "Create a Geotag," you'll be prompted to upload your design. You can upload a PNG file with a transparent background. Use the Upload button right below "Select Your Area"

5. Define your geofence

Next, you'll need to define your geotag area. You will be asked to zoom in or out of the map and draw a fence or area where your Geofilter will be displayed. 

6. Choose your duration

Finally, you need to choose the duration of your geotag. You can choose to have it available for a few hours, days, or even weeks. The longer the duration, the more expensive it will be.

7. Wait for approval

Once you've completed all the steps, submit your geotag for approval. Snapchat will review it to ensure it meets their guidelines, and once approved, it will be available for use in your Snapchat stories.

Creating your own Snapchat geotag is a fun and easy way to add a personal touch to your snaps. You can create them for personal use or to promote your brand or event. With just a little bit of creativity and imagination, you can create a geotag that will make your story stand out from the crowd.

##   How to Create a Snapchat Geotag  
 

Creating the image for a Snapchat geotag is probably the hardest part, mainly because you need basic graphic design skills and a design program. For best results, use a professional design program such as Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop.

- Must be 100% original. (You can't use clipart, even if it's free.)
 - Must be 1080px wide and 2340px tall.
 - Must be a PNG image with transparency enabled.
 - Must be less than 300KB in size.
 - Cannot have any logos or trademarks.

##   About Snapchat Geotags  
 

Whenever you snap a photo or film a short video through Snapchat, you can swipe right on the preview to apply certain filter effects to it—one of which is the geotag filter, which changes depending on your location.

 

Snapchat geotags (or geofilters) are fun images and text overlays that appear on top of a section of your photos or videos, sort of like a sticker. Not all locations have them, though, so if you come across a place that could use one, you can make it yourself.
