# You Won't Believe What Happened to Thousands of Western Digital My Book Live Drives - Hackers Delete All Data Remotely!

Recently, a shocking incident occurred that has sent shivers down the spine of thousands of Western Digital My Book Live Drive owners. According to reports, hackers have been able to delete all data stored on these drives remotely, leaving users in utter disbelief and despair.

The situation was initially reported by several users on the Western Digital community forum, who claimed their My Book Live Drives were being wiped clean without their knowledge. Soon after, the company issued a statement acknowledging the issue, and advising users to disconnect their drives from the internet immediately.

The reason behind the attack is yet to be confirmed, but researchers suspect that it might be due to a vulnerability in the WD My Book Live device's security. Once the hackers gain access to a vulnerable device, they can download a script that triggers the data-wiping process without the user's knowledge.

The affected users are understandably distressed, as many of them have lost years' worth of data, including photos, videos, and important documents. In response to the crisis, Western Digital is offering a free data recovery service to affected customers, but the process may take several days to complete.

This incident serves as a wake-up call for all of us who rely on external storage devices to keep our data safe. Here are some steps we can take to mitigate the risk of a similar attack:

1. Update your device's firmware: Ensure that your external storage device is running the latest firmware version, as this often includes security patches that can prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited.

2. Use strong credentials: Always use unique, strong passwords for your device and associated accounts to minimize the risk of a brute-force attack.

3. Enable two-factor authentication: Many modern devices allow users to enable two-factor authentication, which adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code in addition to a password to access an account.

4. Keep backups: Always keep a backup of your data on a separate storage device and disconnect it from the internet when not in use.

In conclusion, the recent attack on thousands of Western Digital My Book Live Drives highlights the importance of maintaining good cyber hygiene practices to protect our data from cybercriminals. By taking proactive measures like keeping our devices up-to-date and using strong credentials, we can minimize the risk of data loss due to security breaches.

Hard drives from Western Digital’s My Book Live line are being deleted by an unknown attacker. 

 

According to a report from Gizmodo, users first noticed their hard drives being remotely deleted on Wednesday. Since Western Digital is still investigating the incident, the only solution right now is to unplug your hard drive from the internet for the time being. 

 

"We have determined that some My Book Live devices have been compromised by a threat actor," Western Digital’s Jolin Tan told Gizmodo. "In some cases, this compromise has led to a factory reset that appears to erase all data on the device."

 

Lifewire reached out to Western Digital for updates on if/when the issue would be fixed, as well as how many people have been affected, but so far has not received a response. 

 

Gizmodo notes that users have been sharing their experiences with their hard drives being randomly deleted on a WD community thread this week. There even have been warnings on Twitter about the hacking. In the WD community thread, some users said they lost years of data, including photos of kids and weddings, after receiving different types of error messages. 

 

"Tried to access some files via the iPhone app but got an error message saying 'unable to connect.' Assumed it was just a Wi-Fi/network issue but when I tried to access the drive from my PC using a shortcut everything was gone except for (empty) default Public folders: Shared Music, Shared Pictures, Shared Videos and Software," one user explained on the thread. 

 

My Book Live devices are the only devices currently affected by the malware attack. The units were sold from 2010-2014 and last received a firmware update in 2015, but many people still have data stored on them.
