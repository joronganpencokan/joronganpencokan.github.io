# You Won't Believe the EPIC Changes in Windows 10 Build 16199 - Our Hands-On Experience Will Blow Your Mind!

The latest Windows 10 build 16199 is packed with some mind-blowing features that are sure to enhance your computing experience. In this article, we will take you through our hands-on experience of using Windows 10 build 16199 and highlight some of the most exciting changes that you can expect to see.

## Virtual Desktops and Task View Enhancements

The build 16199 comes with several updates to virtual desktops, as well as task view features. Windows 10's virtual desktops feature now allows thumbnail previews of each desktop. Switching between virtual desktops has also become faster and smoother. You can also configure virtual desktops to open the same app on multiple desktops, making it easy to multitask.

Task view has also received various updates, which include a redesigned interface that makes it easier to access recent activities, and improved search capabilities that allow you to find what you're looking for more efficiently.

## Cortana Improvements

Cortana integration has been enhanced in build 16199, making it more intuitive than ever before. You can now interact with Cortana directly from the Start menu, without having to open the Cortana app. You can also type requests instead of speaking, making it suitable for use in quiet areas.

The new Cortana also allows for integration with more third-party applications, making it easy to perform actions like setting reminders, checking the weather and news or updating your calendar.

## Microsoft Edge Improvements

Edge is still the default browser on Windows 10, and build 16199 has made some significant updates to it. For starters, the browser now supports ebooks borrowed from libraries, and you can read them without leaving the Edge browser. Edge has also been integrated with the Windows Ink feature, allowing you to quickly annotate web pages with drawings or handwritten notes.

The browser now features a "set aside" feature that lets you remove tabs from your current browsing session, and the ability to restore such tabs at any later point. Other features include better PDF support, smoother scrolling, and improved performance.

## Gaming Enhancements

Windows 10 Build 16199 introduces support for the Game Mode feature that Microsoft revealed earlier this year. The feature is designed to make gaming the priority when active, optimizing the system resources for better gameplay. The build also comes with Beam integration, which allows you to stream games directly from the OS to the Beam platform.

## Conclusion

In summary, Windows 10 Build 16199 is an exciting piece of software that brings many essential improvements to the table. The build has a little something for everyone, be it the Cortana improvements, better gaming capabilities, and the enhanced Edge browser. If you have Windows 10, we recommend trying out the new build 16199 and experiencing the changes yourself, as it is the future of Windows 10.
