## Understanding the Basics of Mirroring


Mirroring is a technique that allows you to display what you see on your laptop screen onto your TV screen, wirelessly or via a cable connection. The goal of mirroring is to create a second screen that displays whatever you're doing on your laptop. Generally, mirroring requires a little bit of setup on your laptop and TV.

The most common way of mirroring is via HDMI cable. HDMI stands for High Definition Multimedia Interface, which is a type of cable that transfers uncompressed video and audio data from one device to another. It's one of the most effective ways of transmitting high-quality video and audio between two devices.

## Mirror Your Laptop Screen to Your TV via HDMI Cable


To mirror your laptop's screen onto your TV using an HDMI cable, you'll need an HDMI cable and an HDMI port on your TV and laptop. Most modern TVs and laptops come with HDMI ports that support high-definition video and audio.

Here are the steps to mirror your laptop screen to your TV via HDMI cable:

1. Connect one end of the HDMI cable to the HDMI port on your laptop and the other end to the HDMI port on your TV.

2. Turn on your TV and navigate to the appropriate HDMI input.

3. On your laptop, click the Windows key and type "Project."

4. Select the "Project to a Second Screen" option.

5. Choose "Duplicate" to see the same thing on both screens or "Extend" to use your TV as a second screen.

6. Adjust the screen resolution if needed.

## Mirror Your Laptop Screen to Your TV Wirelessly


The good news is that modern-day laptops and smart TVs come with wireless projection technologies such as Miracast, Chromecast, and Apple AirPlay. This means that you can mirror your laptop screen to your TV wirelessly, and you don't need any additional cables.

Here are the steps to mirror your laptop screen to your TV wirelessly:

1. Turn on your TV and make sure it is connected to the Wi-Fi network.

2. On your laptop, click the Windows key and type "Connect."

3. Select the "Connect" app from the list of search results.

4. Click on "Projecting to this PC" and select "Available Everywhere" from the drop-down menu.

5. On your TV, navigate to the screen mirroring option and select your laptop from the list of available devices.

6. After a few seconds, your laptop screen will start mirroring on your TV.

The instructions in this article apply broadly to both Windows and Mac laptops when connecting them to smart HDTVs. It may be possible to mirror a laptop to a non-smart TV, however, it requires the use of additional equipment, not covered in this article.
 
- Both the television and the laptop need to be connected to the same network.Your laptop and TV both should be current and completely updated with any operating system patches or security updates.It is possible that a laptop that was upgraded from an older version of the operating system may not support Miracast (because of outdated hardware).While most HDTVs will support Miracast, there are some that do not, and you will not be able to mirror your laptop to those TVs using Miracast unless you buy a separate Miracast dongle.

 

As long as your computer and your TV support Miracast, mirroring your TV should be a simple process.

 
- Make sure both your laptop and your TV are connected to the same network and then go to the Windows logo button (Start) > Settings > Devices.
 - To get to Settings you could use the keyboard combination Windows Key + I (uppercase 'i').
 - In Bluetooth & other devices click Add Bluetooth or other devices.
 - An Add a device dialog box opens. Select Wireless display or dock.
 - A list of available devices appears, select the television you're trying to connect to.
 - Your laptop will try to connect to the TV, and a message will appear on your television prompting you to allow or deny the connection. Select Allow and the connection will be established. It might take a few seconds for the image of your desktop to appear on the screen.
 - If you have ever connected your laptop to an external monitor, your laptop might see the television as an Extended display. To change this, press the Windows Key + P on your keyboard to open the Projection screen. Select Duplicate or Second Screen Only to show your desktop on the television. Duplicate shows the desktop on both the laptop and the TV and Second Screen Only shows it only on the TV.

##   How to Wirelessly Mirror a Mac Laptop Screen to a TV  
 

Apple notebook computers, called MacBooks, have a feature called AirPlay. If your television supports AirPlay, then wirelessly mirroring your screen to your TV can be accomplished in two ways.

 
###   Wirelessly Mirror a MacBook Using Settings  
 

Depending on how you have AirPlay set up on your MacBook, you may need to go through Settings to mirror your screen.

 
- Open System Preferences.
 - Select Displays.
 - In the dialog box that appears, click the AirPlay Display menu and select the TV you want to mirror your screen to.
 - Your laptop will mirror to your TV and an options box will appear where you can change the optimization and brightness for the screen. You can close out of these windows without ending your AirPlay session.

 
###   How to Wireless Mirror a MacBook to a TV With the AirPlay Icon  
 

If you have enabled Show mirroring options in the menu bar when available you should have an AirPlay icon on your menu bar that you can use to shortcut the process of mirroring your MacBook to your TV.

 

Open System Preferences.

 

Select Displays.

 

In the dialog box that appears, click the AirPlay Display menu and select the TV you want to mirror your screen to.

 

Your laptop will mirror to your TV and an options box will appear where you can change the optimization and brightness for the screen. You can close out of these windows without ending your AirPlay session.

 

All you have to do is click the AirPlay icon and select the TV you want to mirror to. (Yes, it's really that simple on a MacBook).

 
If you haven't enabled the AirPlay icon, you can do that now by going to Settings > Display and placing a checkmark in the box next to Show mirroring options in the menu bar when available.

When you're finished working and want to end your mirroring session on a MacBook, click the AirPlay icon again and select Stop AirPlay. Your MacBook should stop mirroring and your TV will immediately become available again.

 
##   How to Mirror Your Laptop Using Cables  
 

If you don't have a newer laptop or a smart TV, you can probably still mirror your laptop to your TV, you'll just need to use an HDMI cable to do it.

 

All you need to do is connect the HDMI cable to your laptop and to your TV. Then, using the remote on your TV, select the input that corresponds with where you plugged the cable in.

 
If you're using an older laptop, you may need to use a VGA cable. The problem with VGA cables is that they don't carry sound, so you'll also need an audio cable if you want to hear the sounds your computer makes. Also, check your TV to make sure it has VGA ports. If not, you will need to purchase a VGA adapter, too.
 

On Windows, you can then use the keyboard combination Windows Key + P to open display settings and choose how you want to display/mirror your laptop screen.

 

On a MacBook, you may not have HDMI connections so you'll need an adapter for a mini DisplayPort or a USB-C. Once connected you can go to System Preferences > Display to adjust display settings if necessary.
