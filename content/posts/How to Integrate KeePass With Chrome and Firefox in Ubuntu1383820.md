Introduction

Password management has become an increasingly significant issue in modern times due to the proliferation of digital platforms and services. With so many different accounts to keep track of, it's essential to have a secure and efficient way of remembering all your passwords. This is where Keepass comes in, the open-source password manager that lets you store and manage your passwords in a secure and organized manner. However, integrating Keepass seamlessly with your browsers isn't always easy, especially if you use Linux Ubuntu. In this article, we'll show you how to overcome this challenge and unlock your password potential.

Step 1: Install KeePass

The first step in integrating Keepass with your browser on Ubuntu is to install the software. You can do this by going to the official Keepass website and selecting the appropriate download link for Ubuntu. Once the download is complete, use the command line to install Keepass by typing:

sudo apt-get install keepass2

This will install the latest version of Keepass on your Ubuntu system.

Step 2: Install ChromeIPass Extension

After installing Keepass, the next step is to install the ChromeIPass extension for your Chrome browser. The ChromeIPass extension is a third-party add-on that allows you to integrate Keepass with Chrome easily. To install the extension, visit the Chrome Web Store and search for ChromeIPass. Click the "Add to Chrome" button to install the extension.

Step 3: Install KeePassHttp-Connector Add-On

The KeePassHttp-Connector is an add-on for your Firefox browser that lets you connect with Keepass. To install the add-on, visit the Firefox Add-Ons website and search for KeePassHttp-Connector. Click the "Add to Firefox" button to install the add-on.

Step 4: Configure ChromeIPass and KeePassHttp-Connector

Now that you have installed both extensions, it's time to configure them. Open your Keepass password database and go to the "Tools" menu. Select the "Options" menu and click on the "Integration" tab. Check the box next to "Enable KeePassHttp support."

Next, open Chrome and click on the ChromeIPass icon. Click on the gear icon to open the extension's settings menu. In the settings menu, click on the "General" tab and select the "Connect to KeePass" option. Enter the path of your Keepass database file in the "Location" field and click "apply."

In Firefox, click on the KeePassHttp-Connector icon and select "Options." Enter your Keepass password database location in the "Database Path" field and click "OK."

Step 5: Use Keepass and the Browser Extensions

With both extensions configured, you can now use them to manage your passwords seamlessly. Whenever you log in to a website, ChromeIPass and KeePassHttp-Connector will automatically provide you with password suggestions from your Keepass database. Simply click on the suggested password to fill in the login form.

Conclusion

We have often said that you should use a complicated and unique password for each and every of your account. However, unless you have a great memory, you are not going to be able to remember them all. That is why tools like Password Manager come in handy. KeePass is a very handy and useful desktop password manager that allows you to record down all your passwords and store them in a safe place. The only troublesome thing about it is that you always have to switch to this app, search and copy the password, before you can paste it into the login form. In this article, we will show you how to integrate KeePass with Chrome and Firefox in Ubuntu.
 
## Advantages of integrating KeePass to browser
 
The advantage of integrating KeePass to your browser is that you can get it to auto-fill your login form everytime you visit a website. it saves you the effort to switch to and forth between the browser and the password manager. While you can achieve the same functionality using LastPass, you have to know that LastPass stores all your confidential data on their cloud servers. That means, if their servers are down or hacked into, your data are gone.
 
## Isn’t KeePass available for Windows only?
 
KeePass is mainly for Windows and it makes use of the .NET framework which is difficult to setup in other OS. In Linux, there is a port over of the KeePass 2 which you can install. However, it makes use of mono libraries which many people will frown upon. If you don’t wish to install a bunch of mono libraries in your computer, you can try out KeePassX instead, which is only compatible with KeePass 1.x database format.
 
This tutorial will deal with the port over version of KeePass 2.
 
## Setting it up
 
1. Install KeePass 2 in Ubuntu
 
Note that the mono-complete module is necessary for the browser integration and it will install a whole lot of mono libraries.
 
2. Download the KeepassHttp module from its Github page. Extract the zipped files to your Home folder. Open it and you should see a “KeePassHttp.plgx” file. That is the only file we need from this folder.
 

 
3. Open a terminal. We need to copy the “KeePassHttp.plgx” file to the KeePass2 plugins folder.
 
4. Next, open your Keepass 2. If you see a “KeePassHttp Options” under the Tools menu, then the plugin is working.
 
5. Lastly, install ChromelPass for Chrome or PasslFox for Firefox. Restart the browser if necessary.
 
6. After the restart, ChromelPass or PasslFox will prompt you to connect with KeePassHttp. This will generate an encryption key which will be stored in your KeePass2 database.
 
7. Once connected, you will find an option in the context menu that allows you to fill in username and password automatically.
 
That’s it. Your Keepass is now integrated with Chrome and/or Firefox now.
