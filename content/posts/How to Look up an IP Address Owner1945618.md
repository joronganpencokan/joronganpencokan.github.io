#Unveiling the Mystery Behind IP Addresses: Discover the Secret Owner with this Simple Trick!

In today's digital age, every internet-connected device has an IP address that serves as its unique identifier. IP addresses not only help computers and other devices to communicate but can also reveal a lot about their owners. Have you ever come across an IP address and wondered who owns it? In this article, we will unveil the mystery behind IP addresses and show you a simple trick to discover their owners.

##What is an IP Address?

The Internet Protocol (IP) address is a numerical address used to identify devices connected to the internet. Every device has a unique IP address provided by the internet service provider (ISP) or server. An IP address is made up of four numbers separated by dots, for instance, 192.168.1.1.

##How to Find the Owner of an IP Address

If you ever come across an IP address and want to know who owns it, there are several simple ways to find out:

###1. Use an IP lookup tool

IP lookup tools are online tools that enable you to find information about an IP address. One tool you can use is ARIN WHOIS. ARIN WHOIS is a public database that stores information about all IP addresses registered in North America. To use the tool,

- Go to https://whois.arin.net/ui/
- Enter the IP address in the search box
- Click search

The result will show you the registrant's name, organization, and address, among other details.

###2. Use Command Prompt (Windows Users)

Windows users can use the Command Prompt to find the owner of an IP address. To do this,

- Open the Command Prompt by typing CMD in the search box
- Type "tracert (IP address)" and press enter
- The results will display the IP address and its associated network, along with the domain name and owner.

###3. Use Terminal (Mac Users)

Mac users can use the Terminal to find the owner of an IP address. 

- Open Terminal by selecting "Applications" then "Utilities" and then "Terminal".
- Type "whois (IP address)" and press enter
- The results will display the registrant's name, email address, and other details.

##Conclusion

In conclusion, IP addresses are important identifying numbers that serve as the unique identifier of every device connected to the internet. However, you can easily find out who owns an IP address by using an IP lookup tool, Command Prompt, or Terminal. Knowing the owner of an IP address can be crucial in identifying and resolving any network issues or cybercrime.

This article explains how to find the owner of an IP address, whether you know the IP address or not. Also included are instructions for finding an IP address using the Windows command prompt.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- If you know the IP address, enter it on ARIN WHOIS to view ownership.To find an IP address, open Windows command prompt (Start + CMD on Windows) > type ping websitename.com. To find an IP address owner if you don't know the IP address, use Register.com, GoDaddy, or DomainTools.

 
##   How to Find Out Who Owns an IP Address  
 

Every internet protocol (IP) address used on the internet is registered to an owner. The owner may be an individual or a representative of a larger organization such as an internet service provider. Many websites don't conceal their ownership, so you can look up this public information to find the owner. However, some services allow the owner to remain anonymous. As a result, their contact information and name are not easily found.

 

ARIN WHOIS service queries the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) for an IP address and displays who owns the IP address and other information such as a contact number, a list of other IP addresses in that range with the same owner, and dates of registration.

 

For example, for the 216.58.194.78 IP address, ARIN WHOIS says the owner is Google.

 
##   If You Don't Know the IP Address  
 

Some services are similar to ARIN WHOIS, but they can search for the website owner even when the website's IP address is unknown. Examples include Register.com, GoDaddy, and DomainTools.

 

To use ARIN WHOIS to find the owner of an IP address, convert the website to its IP address using a ping command in the Windows command prompt. Open the command prompt and type the following to find the website's IP address:

 

ping websitename.com

 

Replace websitename with the website you want to find the IP address for.

 
##   About Private and Other Reserved IP Addresses  
 

Some IP address ranges are reserved for use on private networks or for internet research. Attempting to look up these IP addresses in Whois returns an owner such as Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). However, these same addresses are employed on many home and business networks worldwide. To find who owns a private IP address in an organization, contact their network system administrator.
