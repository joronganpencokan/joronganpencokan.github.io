Unveiling the Ultimate Guide to Defeating Vampire Survivors and the Ender Boss - You Won't Believe What It Takes!

As Halloween lurks around the corner, prepare yourselves for a spine-chilling adventure that requires ample courage and a strategic plan to eradicate the blood-sucking creatures that haunt us- the Vampire Survivors and the Ender Boss. This ultimate guide intends to enlighten you on the most effective techniques and practices to defeat these notorious monsters and emerge victorious. Hold on tight as we take you through a ride to uncover the mysteries of the supernatural world.

Before we dive into the battle, it is crucial to familiarize ourselves with the enemy. Vampire Survivors, also known as Undead, are immortal beings who feed on the blood of the living to sustain their existence. They are exceptionally resilient to physical attacks, making them formidable foes. On the other hand, the Ender Boss is the ruler of the End Dimension- a realm inhabited by deadly creatures. This creature is colossal in size and has the ability to teleport and summon minions to aid in its defense.

The first and foremost step to defeating Vampire Survivors is to acquire weapons and tools that are capable of causing significant damage. Silver weapons, such as bullets and blades, are highly effective against vampires as silver is a purifying metal in mythical lore. Holy water, while not directly fatal, can immobilize them, allowing you to strike more efficiently. Sunlight is also a highly potent weapon as it can cause severe burns and discomfort to vampires. Always have a plan B in case of a power cut by carrying flashlights or torches to ensure that you can utilize the element of surprise to your advantage.

One of the challenges that come with defeating Ender Boss is their mobility. They can teleport and summon minions, making it difficult to land a fatal blow. Therefore, we recommend that you level up your fighting skills and acquire the best armors available. You can always use enchanted bows and arrows to deal damage from a considerable distance. Make sure to dodge Ender Boss's attacks and keep moving. Look out for their weakness- purple crystals- which can be obtained by destroying Ender Crystals. By shooting at the crystals, you can block the creature's ability to summon minions and lower the likelihood of teleportation. This makes it easier to target and kill the Ender Boss.

In conclusion, defeating Vampire Survivors and the Ender Boss is no walk in the park. It requires careful planning, swift thinking, and agility. Always come prepared with the right weapons and armor to take down these monsters effectively. Equip yourself with knowledge on their weakness, evade their attacks, and strike at the right opportunity. By following the steps outlined in this ultimate guide, you will sure be ready to take down these notorious enemies like a true warrior. Happy hunting, and may the odds be in your favor!

Being nominated as the best indie debut videogame, things are looking brighter for Vampire Survivors. With consistent updates, the roguelike game has several secret characters, hidden stages, powerups, and bosses. The Ender is the final boss of the game which is a fusion of the five Grim Reaper enemies. But there are some prerequisites you need to complete to encounter this boss. So, check out our boss guide on how to find and kill the Ender in Vampire Survivors.
 
## How to Find Ender in Vampire Survivors
 
You will face the Ender in the Cappella Magna stage for surviving 30 minutes in Vampire Survivors. But as mentioned earlier, there are some conditions to encounter the Ender boss. Before you go through them, make sure to pick the best character and weapon to defeat him.
 
Mentioned below are all the requirements you need to complete to find Ender:
 
- You need to unlock the Moongolow stage and teleport into a different region or map.
 - If you are having trouble unlocking this stage, check out our guide on how to unlock the Moongolow stage for more insight.
 - You need to survive the different waves of enemies over there. There are three Rosaries that you can find in this stage.
 - Once you survive the 15-minute mark, pick the Yellow Relic sign to the right of the Rosary. This would unlock the Cappella Magna stage.
 - Now, you need to survive 30 minutes into this stage to encounter the Ender.

 
Once you survive the time limit, the background will fade to black and a cutscene would be triggered. In this cutscene, all the Reapers will merge into a single entity. This entity is the Ender boss that you will face in the Cappella Magna stage.
 
### How to Defeat the Ender
 
Similar to all the bosses, the Ender boss will chase to damage you. But this boss will go the extra mile to cause damage by throwing scythe projectiles at you every 5 seconds. These projectiles will create beams of Reaper trainees, coffins, sprite work, and different fire explosions. You might encounter some difficulties but with some help, you can beat Ender easily.
 
So, here are some tips and strategies to beat or kill the Ender boss in Vampire Survivors:
 
- Firstly, don’t get trapped and keep going in a single direction focusing on his attacks.
 - You can use and upgrade the Magic Wand to inflict maximum damage. As there are no enemies, the Magic Wand will only damage the Ender.
 - You can also use Garlic and Holy Bible to maintain a distance while damaging him.
 - In addition to these resources, you can also use Laurel and upgrade it. This would help you with the incoming scythes.

 

 
While defeating Ender can take some time, it can reward you with Great Gospel. This item is a relic that permanently unlocks the Limit break for all the weapons. That means it allows you to enable the maximum cap of all the weapons. But once the Great Gospel is obtained, you will not encounter Ender again.
