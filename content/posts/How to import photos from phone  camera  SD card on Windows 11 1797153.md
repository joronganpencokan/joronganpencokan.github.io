Windows 11 makes it super easy to import photos and videos from any external storage source (including an Android phone, iPhone, iPad, digital camera, USB flash drive, and SD card). However, you still need to know the tools to complete the task.
 
The ability to import files to your computer can come in handy in many situations. For example, when you want to create a local backup of your photos and videos in case the device breaks. The drive is running out of space, and you need to offload the files to make more room. You capped out the cloud storage service and need to access your pictures for editing and more.
 
Regardless of the reason, Windows 11 includes many ways to import files from your phone or external storage devices using the Photos app, File Explorer, and OneDrive.
 
This guide will teach you the different ways to import your personal pictures from external storage to your computer.
 
- Import images from Photos app on Windows 11
 - Import photos from File Explorer on Windows 11
 - Import photos from OneDrive on Windows 11
