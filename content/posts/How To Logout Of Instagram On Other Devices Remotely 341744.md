Social media is something everybody likes and we spend a considerable amount of our time on it, and why not! It helps us to stay connected with the world. But with the rise in the popularity of social media platforms, they are being more prone to hacking as well. And therefore these platforms keep adding new security features like a remote log out, two-factor authentication, etc. to them. But unlike Facebook and Gmail, Instagram doesn’t provide any feature to remotely log out of your Instagram account on other devices. However, we have a workaround using which you can easily log out of Instagram remotely on other devices.
 
There are many situations when you would like to remotely log out your Instagram account from another device. For instance, when you have logged into your Instagram account on your friend’s device and forgot to log out. Or if you have a doubt that your account is being misused or hacked by someone. No matter what the situation is, the method given below will help you in signing out of Instagram from everywhere. It can be achieved from the Instagram app on Android and iPhone as well as from its website.
 
## Check If Your Account Is Hacked
 
Before actually signing out from Instagram on other devices you can confirm if your account is being used by someone or not. For that, you can check for some suspicious activity on your account which you have not done.
 
For example, likes or comments on someone’s posts, or photos being posted on your account without your permission. To check whose post you’ve liked you can go to Settings > Account > Posts You’ve Liked.
 
Other than that, you can check the account activity to know about the time you spent on Instagram for the past 7 days. For that, you can go to Settings > Account > Your Activity.
 
With this feature, you can get an idea if someone is using your Instagram account or not by looking at the usage pattern of your account. However, if you could not find any evidence of anyone using your account, you can still logout of Instagram on another device, because why take the risk?
