# Is Google About to Dethrone Twitch with their New YouTube Gaming Launch?

Google has made a bold move to dethrone Twitch with the launch of their new platform, YouTube Gaming. The platform, which was officially released on August 26, offers gamers a whole new way to experience gaming videos, live streams, and more. With its superior technology, YouTube Gaming is poised to be a game-changer in the world of gaming.

Twitch, which was founded in 2011, has been the dominant platform for gaming live streaming, but its position is now being threatened by YouTube Gaming. The new platform is an extension of the already popular YouTube, which has more than one billion active users every month. YouTube Gaming was designed exclusively for gamers, making it much easier for them to find and watch their favorite gaming content.

The new platform has a user-friendly interface, which makes it easy to navigate the vast sea of gaming content. Users can easily search for specific games, watch live streaming, and explore new games with a simple click of a button. This makes it easier for gamers to connect with each other and share their experiences.

One of the standout features of YouTube Gaming is its superior technology. With Google's backing, the platform is much faster and smoother than Twitch, and it offers better streaming quality. This means that gamers can enjoy their favorite content without any lag or buffering.

Another significant advantage of YouTube Gaming is its partnership with game developers. The platform has already signed deals with major game developers, including Activision, Blizzard Entertainment, and Ubisoft. These partnerships mean that YouTube Gaming will have exclusive content only available on its platform, making it more attractive to gamers.

Despite the clear advantages YouTube Gaming has, Twitch still has a significant following. Twitch has more than 100 million monthly active users and has established itself as the go-to platform for gamers. However, YouTube Gaming is quickly making strides, with more than 88 billion views of gaming videos and more than 200 million gaming-related activities on the platform.

In conclusion, YouTube Gaming is poised to be the next big thing in the world of gaming. With its superior technology, user-friendly interface, and partnerships with game developers, it's only a matter of time before it dethrones Twitch as the dominant platform for gaming live streaming. Game on!

Twitch officially has a new competitor, “YouTube Gaming”. As it was previously rumored, Google has just announced a new website and app dedicated to video games that will offer on demand videos and live streaming from gamers. Google is expected to launch YouTube Gaming later this summer, initially in the US and UK — no specific date has been announced.
 
Google is building YouTube Gaming as a separate experience from YouTube tailor to video games. The official YouTube blog explains that search has been refined, so that users typing “call” will show them “Call of Duty” and not “Call Me Maybe”. The new experience will offer channels that anyone can subscribe, and notifications for new live streams. The company says that it will be improving the live experience in the coming weeks to simplify broadcast of gameplay in YouTube.

YouTube Gaming will feature the new high frame rate streaming at 60fps, DVR, and automated stream conversion to YouTube video. In addition, users will no longer have to schedule live events, and there will only be a link to share all the video gaming streams.
