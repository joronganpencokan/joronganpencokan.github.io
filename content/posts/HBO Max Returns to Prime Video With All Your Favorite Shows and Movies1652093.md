With the return of HBO Max, Prime members can enjoy (or revisit) several popular shows like House of the Dragon and Succession. Or they can check out the upcoming fourth season of DC's Doom Patrol, or see how the live-action adaptation of Naughty Dog's The Last of Us turned out when it releases in January.

 

"Warner Bros. Discovery is committed to making HBO Max available to as broad an audience as possible, while also advancing our data-driven approach to understanding our customers and best serving their viewing interests," said Warner Bros. Discovery Chief Revenue and Strategy Officer Bruce Campbell in the press release.

 

Warner Bros. also says, "... subscribers will have access to the expanded content offering that will be available in Warner Bros. Discovery's enhanced streaming service," which launches in 2023. This could imply that when WarnerMedia finishes merging HBO Max with Discovery+, Prime members who have subscribed to HBO Max will be included in the "upgrade," but Warner Bros. has not made that clear yet.
