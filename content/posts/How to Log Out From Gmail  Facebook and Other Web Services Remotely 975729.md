# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Log Out from Gmail, Facebook, and More - Even When You're Miles Away!

Do you ever forget to log out from your email or social media accounts, leaving them open for anyone to access? Or perhaps you've had to make a quick exit from your computer or phone, forgetting to properly sign out. It can be a nerve-wracking experience, especially if your accounts contain sensitive information. Fortunately, logging out has never been easier, even when you're miles away from your devices.

Google, Facebook, and other popular platforms understand that security is essential in today's digital age. They offer various tools and features that make it easy to log out and protect your accounts, even when you're not at your computer or phone. Here are some example steps you can follow for logging out from Gmail and Facebook accounts:

1. Gmail: 
Firstly, you may navigate to Gmail's website, sign-in to your account. Then, click on your profile picture (or the first letter of your name) in the top right corner of the screen, and select "Sign out." Gmail will then ask you to confirm that you want to log out, ensuring that you don't accidentally sign out. Alternatively, Gmail's security settings also allow you to remotely log out from all devices. To do this, scroll down to the bottom of your inbox and click "Details" next to the "Last account activity" section. From there, select "Sign out all other web sessions."

2. Facebook: 
If you're logged in to Facebook on your computer, click on the downward-facing arrow in the top right corner of the screen, and select "Log Out." Facebook will then ask if you want to remain logged in or log out, allowing you to choose the safest option. Moreover, Facebook also provides options for remote logouts. To access this feature, click on the downward-facing arrow in the top right corner of the screen, select "Settings & Privacy," and click "Settings." From there, select "Security and Login" from the left menu, scroll down to "Where You're Logged In," and click "See More." This page will show you a list of all the devices where you're currently logged in. Click "Log Out Of All Sessions" to log out from all devices at once.

These steps are just a couple of examples - different websites and apps may have their own variations of logging out. However, they all make it easy to log out and secure your accounts, even if you're not by your computer or phone. By taking a few simple steps like this, you can protect your privacy and prevent others from accessing your accounts.

Overall, logging out from Gmail, Facebook, and other sites doesn't need to be a complicated task. With the right tools and features, logging out can be swift and straightforward, even when you're miles away. So, don't forget to sign out - it only takes a moment, but it can save you a lot of trouble in the long run.

There are times when you are not using your own PC to log in to Gmail or Facebook. This could happen when you are travelling and checking your email in an Internet cafe. The worst thing that could happen is forgetting to log out of your accounts, making them vulnerable to exploits and attacks. Here are the ways to log out from Google, Facebook and LinkedIn remotely if you have forgotten to log them out on another PC.
 
## Logging out of Google remotely
 
To log out of Google, all you have to do is to log in to Gmail (on the desktop) and scroll down to the bottom of the page. Click the “details” link below the “Last account activity.”
 

 
On the window that pops up, click the “Sign out all other sessions” button.
 
That’s it. 
 
## Logging out of Facebook remotely
 
Log in to your Facebook account and click the Down arrow at the top right corner of the menu bar. Select Settings.
 
Go to the “Security” settings and click the section “Where you’re logged in.”
 
From here, you can view which PC, location and time that you are logged in. Click the “End Activity” link to log out of that session. 
 
## Other web services
 
### Dropbox
 
Log in to your Dropbox account on your desktop browser and click on the “Settings” link under your name. Go to the “Security” tab. Scroll down the page and under “Sessions” you can find all the logged in sessions. 
 
To logo ut of Dropbox on another browser, click the cross beside the entry and you are done. 
 
## Twitter and LinkedIn
 
Unlike Google and Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter doesn’t come with a way to detect sessions on other PCs and allow you to logout remotely. However, if you change your LinkedIn/Twitter password on any browser, it will automatically close all active sessions.
 
Note: We will update this post as we uncover more apps that allow you to log out from sessions remotely. 
 
## Conclusion
 
It would be great if all web apps came with a way for you to log out of sessions remotely; unfortunately, only a few of them do. It is, thus, very important for you to remember to log out of your accounts when you are done with your session, even on your own computer.
