Unleash Your Inner Assassin: Master the 'Au Naturel' Challenge in Hitman 3 with Our Expert Guide

Hitman 3 has taken players on a thrilling journey through various assassinations, and completing challenges makes the adventure even more exciting. One particular challenge that has intrigued players is the 'Au Naturel' challenge, which requires you to complete a mission without changing your attire. This may seem like a daunting task, but with our expert guide, you will be able to unleash your inner assassin and master this challenge in no time.

1. Choose the Right Mission

To successfully complete the 'Au Naturel' challenge, it is important to choose the right mission. We recommend starting with a mission that does not require you to disguise yourself too much. The Berlin mission is an excellent choice as it features a nightclub where most guests are dressed up, and you can easily blend in without changing your clothes.

2. Scout the Area

Before starting the mission, scout the area to familiarize yourself with the surroundings. Look for vantage points and hiding spots that can help you avoid detection. Take note of guard patrols and their respective routes so you can plan your moves accordingly.

3. Make Use of Environmental Opportunities

Hitman 3 is full of environmental opportunities that you can use to your advantage. Use them to create distractions, set up traps, or cause chaos without ever revealing your true identity. Remember, you cannot change outfits, but you can always use the environment to your benefit.

4. Avoid Suspicious Behavior

To complete the 'Au Naturel' challenge, you must avoid engaging in suspicious behavior while blending in with the crowd. Do not run, jump, or climb in public areas, as it can raise suspicion. Stick to walking and moving like any other guest would.

5. Keep a Low Profile

When blending in with the crowd, it is essential to keep a low profile. Avoid attracting attention to yourself by staying away from areas where guards are patrolling or where there are many people. Stick to your objective, complete it, and get out without raising any alarms.

6. Use Non-Lethal Methods

As an assassin, taking out your targets without being detected is essential. During the 'Au Naturel' challenge, make use of non-lethal methods such as using sedatives or fiber wires to incapacitate your target silently. This will help you avoid detection and complete the mission successfully.

In Conclusion

The 'Au Naturel' challenge in Hitman 3 is a thrilling experience that tests your stealth and strategy skills. With our expert guide, you can unleash your inner assassin and master this challenge with ease. Remember to choose the right mission, scout the area, make use of environmental opportunities, avoid suspicious behavior, keep a low profile, and use non-lethal methods to complete the 'Au Naturel' challenge successfully. Good luck, assassin!
