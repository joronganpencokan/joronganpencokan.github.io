Firstly, select your desired red fruits, such as strawberries, raspberries or cherries, that are ripe, juicy and fresh. The main ingredient should be fresh and of the highest quality possible to ensure that you end up with an amazing end product.

Once you have collected your red fruits, it's time to blend them into a fine puree. To achieve the perfect consistency, make sure to remove any seeds or stems from the fruits as these can affect the texture of the sorbet.

The next step involves combining the fruit puree with a sweetener, such as honey or sugar, and a thickening agent, like corn syrup or gelatin, to help stabilise the sorbet and create a smooth texture.

It's important to let the mixture cool down to room temperature, then refrigerate it for at least 2 hours until it's thickened and chilled. You could also use an ice cream maker to churn the mixture into a smooth and creamy texture.

Once the sorbet mixture is ready, you can then scoop it into colourful cones or bowls and enjoy it in the enchanting Disney Dreamlight Valley. It's refreshing, healthy and satisfying!
