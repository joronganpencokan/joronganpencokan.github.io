Android smartphones nowadays are arriving with better hardware specs. Since we have powerful smartphones these days, it is common for a regular user to think about whether a phone can run Windows 11.

 
### Can you run Windows 11 on Android?


The answer to this question depends on many factors. Technically, you can’t run Windows 11 on your Android smartphone. But the arrival of Android 13 might change the answer to this question.
The upcoming Android 13 has improved virtualization support. With the help of virtualization, you can run not only Windows 11 but any other OS on your Android phone.
The standardized system for virtualization was revealed during the Android 13 Dev Preview launch. This allows you to run an OS within another OS, something very similar to Virtualbox or any other sandbox application on Android.
So, yes, you can run Windows 11 on an Android phone, but you need to wait for Android 13. Recently, an app developer Danny Lin managed to install Windows 11 ARM running on a virtual machine on Pixel 6.
