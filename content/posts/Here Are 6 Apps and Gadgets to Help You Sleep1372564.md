Getting a good night's sleep is essential to our health and wellbeing. But, in today's fast-paced world, many of us struggle to get the sleep we need. Fortunately, technology has come to our rescue. With the help of apps and gadgets, we can now monitor our sleep patterns, improve our sleep quality, and wake up refreshed and energized. In this article, we'll explore six apps and gadgets that can revolutionize your sleep game.

1. Sleep Cycle:
Sleep Cycle is an app that tracks your sleep patterns and wakes you up during your lightest sleep phase, making it easier to wake up feeling refreshed. The app uses your phone's accelerometer to detect your movements while you sleep and then analyzes the data to determine which sleep phase you're in. Sleep Cycle also provides you with detailed graphs and statistics on your sleep patterns, so you can identify patterns and make changes to your sleep habits if needed.

2. Philips SmartSleep:
The Philips SmartSleep is a wearable headband that helps you get a more restful sleep by enhancing your deep sleep. The headband uses a technology called "slow-wave sleep stimulation" to enhance the brain's slow-wave activity, which is the stage of sleep where our bodies recover and rejuvenate. The headband is designed to be comfortable to wear and can be synced with the Philips SleepMapper app, which provides you with personalized tips and coaching to improve your sleep quality.

3. White Noise:
If you have trouble falling asleep, the White Noise app might be just what you need. The app provides a range of soothing sounds, from rain and thunder to ocean waves and crickets chirping, that can help you relax and drift off to sleep. The app also lets you create your own soundscape by mixing and matching different sounds to create a personalized white noise experience.

If you struggle with insomnia, the Dodow might be the gadget for you. The Dodow is a small device that emits a calming blue light that pulses at a slow, rhythmic pace. You place the device on your nightstand, and as you focus on the light, you start to relax and breathe more slowly. The Dodow can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer, without the need for medication.

Smart mattresses are a new generation of mattresses that use sensors and embedded technology to monitor your sleep patterns and adjust the mattress to your needs.

Sleep is a blessing, but not everyone gets to enjoy eight hours of sound sleep. Whether you spend too much time in front of the TV/PC before going to sleep or you have a sleep disorder, not having proper sleep will surely disrupt your life. If you are having trouble going to sleep and thinking of going for sleeping pills like millions of other people, it might be healthier to give technology a try.
 
There are many apps and gadgets that can help you sleep using different methods, like soothing sounds, hypnosis, meditation, colored lights and some other proven methods. Below we have listed six apps and gadgets that may help you sleep.
 
## Apps to Help You Sleep
 
Below are three apps that will help you sleep using different audio-based techniques.
 
### 1. Relax & Sleep Well Hypnosis
 

 
This is a self hypnosis and meditation app by popular British hypnotherapist Glenn Harrold. Relax & Sleep Well Hypnosis basically consists of recordings of Glenn Harrold on multiple self hypnosis types. With the free version you get a 29-minute self hypnosis recording for falling to sleep with background sounds and Glenn’s calming voice. You will also get a meditation music track of 639 hertz Solfeggio Sonic Meditation that will surely help you relax. You will have to buy the rest of the tracks as in-app purchases. They each cater to different self hypnosis and meditation needs like relaxing, losing weight, gaining confidence, staying happy, lucid dreams, and smoking cessation.
 
Android and iOS
 
### 2. Pzizz
 
Pzizz plays a different soundtrack every time you use it to help you sleep using sounds, music, voices and binaural beats all together. Pzizz claims it can “solve insomnia” using its unique random algorithm that generates a new sound track every time you use it. It also claims that there are over 100 billion combinations, so you should not hear the same track twice. On top of that it gives full control over track duration (10 min – 12 hours) and controls individual voices/music/sounds and audio type like stereo or 3D. The best part is that the app is completely free to use now, although it was $9.99 in the past.
 
### 3. Sleep Genius
 
Sleep Genius comes with tracks created using neurosensory algorithms that help your brain get ready to sleep and then guide it during the sleeping cycles. This enables you to sleep easily and deeply through the whole night. It also comes with a unique alarm that takes fI’ve minutes to wake you up energized using varying sounds. Sleep Genius is primarily created for NASA astronauts to help them sleep, and in a NASA 2015 annual publication it was a featured technology. The app costs $9.99 to enjoy all of the features, including power naps and sleep tracking.
 
## Gadgets to Help You Sleep
 
Below are three gadgets that help you sleep using different methods.
 
### 1. Withings Aura
 
Its main function is sleep tracking, but it also does a great job of helping you fall asleep. Aura comes with a sensor that tucks under your mattress to track body movements, heart rate and breathing cycles, etc. Aura itself works as a lamp and releases light that stimulates melatonin (a hormone responsible for sleep), and it also has soothing soundtracks to help you sleep. If you want a good sleep tracker that also helps you sleep, then Aura is worth considering.
 
Price: $299.95
 
### 2. BluBlocker
 
The blue light coming out from your TV/PC’s screen affects melatonin hormone inversely and makes it hard to sleep afterwards. BluBlocker glasses block the blue light and also UV light to ensure you sleep easily after using a digital device and see things more clearly on them. They come in many styles to suit your style.
 
Price: $99.95
 
### 3. Drift Light
 
Drift Light is a bulb that is specifically created to help you sleep. It emits less blue light than regular bulbs and comes with a 37-minute dimming time (equal to a sunset) to help you go to sleep. The bulb is capable of emitting light equal to a 40 watt regular bulb, but it only uses 7 watts power.
 
Price: $24.95
 
## Bonus
 
You can also use a smart bed like Sleep Number’s x12 bed to help you sleep better. I didn’t add this in the above list due to its hefty price tag that may inversely affect your sleep. It is a voice-controlled bed that comes with an adjustable base, a special pressure-relieving foam, a robust sleep tracker, adjustable stiffness and a massager. If you have some money to throw around, combine the x12 bed with the above apps and gadgets to get the best sleep.
 
Price: $8000 – $10500 depending on the bed size
