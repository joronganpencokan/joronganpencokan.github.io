On August 18th, Microsoft resumed the Insider’s program by releasing Windows 10 build 10525 to the Fast ring of updates. The new preview includes a number of changes since the last public build, such as the ability to add color to the title bar, which was a highly requested feature, and there are improvements to the memory management in Windows 10.
 
If you didn’t like the boring white title bar on File Explorer and apps, Microsoft is adding the ability to change the title bar color from the Personalization settings. Here’s is how you can configure the new visual change.
 
Microsoft is also introducing the concept of “compression store” in the Memory Manager, which basically means that when memory fills up in the system, compression store will compress unused pages, instead of writing the pages to disk. This will allow you to run more apps and improve performance, but only when needed.
 
The new build also includes a few new known issues, such as Mobile Hotspot doesn’t work, the Movie & TV app will receive a new update through the Windows Store to fix video playback issue, and additional language pack won’t be available during the setup of this build, but it will get fix on future releases.
