# Find Out Which Smart Speaker Reigns Supreme: The Ultimate Google Home Vs Alexa Showdown!

Smart speakers have become ubiquitous in homes all around the world in recent years. Whether it's playing music, setting reminders, or controlling the lights, smart speakers have truly revolutionized the way we operate in our homes.

Google Home and Amazon's Alexa are two of the most popular smart speakers currently available. So, if you're looking to purchase a smart speaker for your home, which one should you choose? Let's find out in the ultimate Google Home vs Alexa showdown!

## Design and Build

The Google Home has a sleek and minimalist design, with a cylindrical shape and a fabric mesh exterior. It comes in a range of colors, including Chalk, Charcoal, and Coral.

On the other hand, Alexa has a variety of designs, from the Echo Dot's puck-like design to the Echo Show's tablet-like screen. Alexa also comes in a variety of colors, including Charcoal, Heather Gray, and Sandstone.

While both have different designs, they are both equally appealing and stylish.

## Voice Recognition and Control

Both speakers offer excellent voice recognition capabilities. However, Google Home edges ahead due to its ability to understand natural language better than Alexa. With Google Home, you can ask more complex questions and still get the correct response.

Additionally, Google Home has the ability to recognize the voices of up to six different users, enabling it to create customized experiences for each.

In terms of control, Alexa has the ability to control more smart home devices than Google Home. Furthermore, Alexa has a more extensive range of skills, allowing you to do more things with voice commands.

## Sound Quality

Sound quality is an essential aspect of any smart speaker, and both Google Home and Alexa deliver excellent sound quality.

Google Home has a powerful speaker that produces clear, crisp, and well-balanced sound. It also has a feature called Smart Sound, which automatically adjusts the equalizer settings to optimize the sound quality based on the acoustics of your room.

Alexa also has a decent speaker that produces clear and crisp sound. However, it doesn't have the same range as Google Home, and the bass can sometimes be lacking.

## Value for Money

Google Home and Alexa come at different price points, with Alexa generally being the cheaper option.

Google Home's prices range from $99 to $299, depending on the model. The Google Home Mini, the most affordable model, is priced at $49.

On the other hand, Amazon's Alexa ranges from $29 to $200, depending on the model. The Echo Dot, which is Amazon's most affordable option, is available for just $29.

While Alexa is cheaper, Google Home offers more features and a more premium feel overall.

## Final Verdict

Both Google Home and Alexa have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice ultimately comes down to personal preferences.

If you prioritize voice recognition and control over value for money, Google Home might be the better option for you. But if you're looking for the best value for your money, Alexa is the way to go.

Overall, both smart speakers are great options for anyone looking to add a smarter touch to their home. Consider your priorities, and you'll find the perfect device to enhance your home experience!

##   Overall Findings  
 
- Uses the Google Assistant virtual assistant.
 - Lots of different devices and form factors.
 - Fantastic AI with realistic speech and a lot of accent options.
 - Growing support for third party skills.

 

Google Home and Alexa are fairly evenly matched on most points, with minor differences in hardware that aren't likely to tip the scales for most people. The AI-driven virtual assistants are what make each platform interesting, and that's where the most important differences come into play.

 

Alexa has historically been the one to beat in terms of skills, especially third party Alexa skills, which add additional functionality. However, Google has made up enough ground in that department that you're better off checking whether each system has the specific skills you need rather than making a choice based on how many skills each one offers.

 
##   Design: Nobody's Winning Any Design Awards  
 
- Multiple form factors that primarily shy away from sharp angles.
 - Flagship device features interchangeable fabric and metal bases and looks like an air freshener.

 
- Multiple form factors, tending toward cylinders and geometric shapes.
 - Flagship Echo offers removable fabric and wood covers.

 

The flagship Google Home looks more like a gel-filled air freshener than a piece of high tech kit, with a rounded base, sloping conical body, and slanted top. The smaller Home Mini is significantly less complex, inhabiting a flattened spherical body with fabric on top and plastic on the bottom. Other devices in the line use similar design cues, tending to shy away from sharp angles in most cases in favor of rounded corners.

 

The flagship Echo started out looking like a matte-black Pringles can and eventually evolved into a stockier device with replaceable fabric and wood covers to better fit into a variety of home decors. The Echo Dot followed a similar path, starting out as a hockey puck and gaining a fabric surround to give it a slightly less angular look. Other devices in the line are similarly basic, like the mostly spherical Echo Spot and angular Echo Show.

 
##   Sound and Music: Quality Vs. Volume  
 
- Gets louder than Google Home devices.
 - Can play most online services, but not YouTube Music.
 - Cloud music feature no longer available.
 - Some devices feature 3.5mm in/out, all include 3.5mm out.
 - Bluetooth streaming available.

 

The overall question of sound quality is more complicated than that, with the Home Max providing better bass response and less vibration than the Echo Studio, and the Echo Dot sounding a bit better than the Google Home Mini.

 

In terms of compatibility with online streaming services, it's a wash. Both ecosystems provide wide compatibility, except with each others own services. That is to say you can't stream Prime Music on a Home and you can't stream Google's All Access on an Echo.

 

Alexa devices win, hands down, in terms of wired connectivity, with 3.5mm jacks present on each device in the lineup. That isn't a big deal if you prefer wireless connections, but it is an option that the Home devices just don't have.

 
##   Voice Controls and Skills: Google Is Closing in Fast  
 
- "Okay Google" and "Hey, Google" only wake-word choices.
 - Lots of voice and accent options, some sound better than others.
 - Has lagged behind in skills, but is closing the gap.
 - Draws on Google's extensive Knowledge Graph and powerful AI technology.

 

In terms of voice options, Google Home wins out. Alexa is locked in to a single voice that sounds pretty good, but Google Home gives you a lot of different options if you want to mix things up.

 

Both systems offer good speech recognition, although the Google Assistant-driven Home is better at answering general knowledge questions and parsing web-based queries. Alexa gets stuck if you don't use specific wording, and it also relies on Wikipedia a lot more than Home does. For some questions, you need to add a skill as Alexa simply can't answer them alone.

 

In terms of third party skills that provide additional functionality, Alexa has held the lead historically. However, Google has closed the gap to the point where the distinction is no longer as important. If you need your virtual assistant to interface with a specific device or technology, or perform a specific function, check to see which platform has the appropriate skill before you choose a platform, as it's no longer safe to assume Alexa will and Home won't.

 
##   Smart Home Integration and Connectivity  
 
- Decent compatibility with smart home devices, uses Nest Hub and compatible with other hubs.
 - Compatible with Chromecast.
 - No Home-to-Home inter-device calling.
 - Can make phone calls using VoIP.
 - Slightly weaker Wi-Fi connectivity.

 
- Excellent compatibility with smart home devices, uses Echo Plus hub, and compatible with other hubs.
 - Compatible with Fire TV.
 - Can make "drop in" calls to other Echo devices.
 - Can make calls over a land-line with an adapter.
 - Slightly stronger Wi-Fi connectivity.

 

It's worth checking to see if your existing smart home devices are compatible with Google Home before investing in a bunch of Home and Home Mini devices, but Home can do pretty much everything Alexa can do in terms of controlling lights, thermostats, garage doors, and other smart home tech.

 

There are also some differences in the way that Home and Alexa devices handle voice calling, and video calling in the case of the Echo Show. Home devices are capable of placing phone calls using voice over IP (VoIP), meaning you can use your Google Home to call a cellphone or landline using your internet connection.

 

Echo devices can also make VoIP calls, but only using the Skype skill and the Skype to Phone service. You can also turn an Echo into a voice-controller speakerphone if you have a landline and use the Echo Connect peripheral.

 

Echo devices also support drop-in calling, which Home devices don't. This feature allows you to use your Echo device to call a friend or family member's echo directly. This feature, while handy, can be disabled if you don't want people dropping in on you unannounced.
