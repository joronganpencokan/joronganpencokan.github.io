Are you tired of the limited functionalities of your computer? Are you tired of switching between your computer and phone to use different applications? Then this article is for you! By following these simple tricks, you can now run Android apps on your computer and revolutionize the entire PC experience.

But how is that possible? With the help of Android emulators, you can easily run Android apps on your computer. An Android emulator is a software that can mimic the Android operating system on your computer. By doing so, it enables you to run Android applications on your computer without a hitch.

Here are some simple tricks to run Android apps on your computer using Android emulators:

## Step 1: Choose an Android Emulator

Selecting the right Android emulator is the first and most crucial step. There are several Android emulators available on the Internet, such as Bluestacks, NoxPlayer, MEmu, and many others. But choosing the right emulator depends on your computer’s hardware configuration, operating system, and the type of application you want to use.

Generally, Bluestacks and NoxPlayer are two of the most popular and user-friendly Android emulators with a good reputation on the Internet. Bluestacks is suitable for games and other high-graphics applications, while NoxPlayer is more suitable for general usage and office works.

## Step 2: Install the Android Emulator

After selecting the right Android emulator, it is time to download and install it on your computer. Emulators not only mimic the Android operating system but also the Android apps. Therefore, they need a certain amount of RAM and processor speed to run smoothly.

Once you have downloaded the emulator, click on the downloaded file, follow the installation wizard, and install it on your computer.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Android Emulator

After installing the emulator, it’s time to set it up. Emulators usually require Google account login to access the Play Store and install applications.

Provide your Google account credentials to access the Play Store and other Google-related services. Once you have completed the login process, you can easily access the Play Store, where you can download and install any Android app you want.

## Step 3: Install and Run Android Apps

Now that you have set up the emulator and logged in with your Google account, it’s time to download and install your favorite Android app on your computer.

Open the Play Store, search for your desired app, and click on the ‘install’ button. Once the installation process is complete, you can easily run the app on your computer as you would on your phone.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, running Android apps on your computer has never been easier with these simple tricks. By using Android emulators, you can make the most of your computer and enjoy the same experience as you would on your phone. So, try these steps and revolutionize your PC experience today!

## Tips to Run Android Apps On Pc 2015 :-
 
### #1 Download and Install BlueStacks


BlueStacks App Player is available for Windows and Mac OSs. BlueStacks App Player is a quick, compact install to your system easily. The only choice you make during the install is whether to allow the program to make notifications, as well as the option to opt in to BlueStacks Spotlight, which holds daily app giveaways.

 

Download BlueStacks for Windows
Download BlueStacks for Mac OSX

 
### #2 Home Screen


After installed, BlueStacks app player will boot up to its Home Screen, where you can access your installed apps, look up apps in the “Top Charts,” search for apps, and access settings. You can use the mouse for basic touch controls here, with clicking and holding to simulate basic tap and swipe controls. From here, we’ll need to do a bit more setup before you can get around to installing apps. You’ll need to set up access to the Google Play store and associate a Google Account with BlueStacks App Player.

 
### #3 Setting up the Google Play Store


After installed, the first thing you will want to do is associate our Google Account so that you can get onto the Google Play Store and download apps. Go to “My Apps” and click on “1-Click Sync Setup,” which will bring up a wizard interface that will guide you through the process. Basically, you’ll need to either create a Google account, or sign in with your existing one.

 
### #4 Installing & Running Apps


Once you’ve accessed one of the three app stores, you can then navigate that store. Within Google Play, for instance, you can take advantage of the store’s search and other features. Once you return to the Home Screen, your newly installed app should be ready to run. BlueStacks can run an impressive variety of apps from social networking tools and multimedia apps to games. However, BlueStacks won’t run everything, so expect a little trial and error for compatibility.

 
### #5 Controls & Settings


You should now have everything you need to install and run apps from BlueStacks, so we’ll finish up with some extra notes on in-app controls, as well as settings. Unless you happen to be running a touchscreen rig or a Windows 8 tablet, you’re going to need some way to approximate pinch to zoom, as well as tilt controls.
Pinch to Zoom: Control +, or Control –
Tilt Controls: ‘Z’ or ‘X’ can be used to simulate tilting a device left or right.
BlueStacks supports the use of gamepad controls for many apps, which will be a godsend for users looking to play Android games on a PC. Plug in your controller, and Bluestacks should inform you if a particular app supports a controller.
