#### 4. Learn Cryptography
 
Cryptography is mainly used in SSL-based internet communication and thus, every hacker needs to understand its importance. It is the art and technique of securing fragile information by using codes. In this way, only the sender and receiver are able to access the information while it remains gibberish for the rest.
 
Generally, cryptography comes useful in e-commerce, ATM cards, computer passwords, etc. Being an ethical hacker, you need to understand the practices, rule book, and strategies used in cryptography. You must also know about the various techniques and tools used for cracking passwords. Also, try to incorporate learning about encryption algorithms to figure out what makes them difficult to decrypt even by experts.
