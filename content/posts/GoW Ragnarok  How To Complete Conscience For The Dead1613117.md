Title: Unveiling the Ultimate Strategy to Conquer Conscience for the Dead in God of War Ragnarok - You Won't Believe What it Takes!

Introduction:

God of War Ragnarok is the grandiose finale of the critically acclaimed Norse mythology-based action-adventure game franchise. It features Kratos, a Spartan warrior turned God of War, and his young son Atreus, as they embark on a perilous journey to stop Ragnarok, the mythical doom of the gods. In this epic quest, they will confront powerful deities, legendary beasts, and the undead, among other foes. One of the most challenging aspects of the game is the Conscience mechanic, which punishes Kratos for killing human enemies by lowering his stats and causing him to be haunted by their apparitions. However, there is a way to overcome this obstacle and triumph over the dead. Here is the ultimate strategy to conquer conscience in God of War Ragnarok.

Section 1: Understanding Conscience

Before delving into the strategy, it is essential to understand what Conscience represents in God of War Ragnarok. Essentially, it is a moral compass that measures Kratos' alignment with his past deeds and his connection with Atreus. Whenever Kratos kills a human enemy, his Conscience meter decreases, and the ghosts of his victims appear to taunt and guilt-trip him. This can affect Kratos' attributes, such as his health, defense, and strength, making him weaker in battles. Moreover, it can strain his relationship with Atreus, who becomes upset and disappointed by his father's ruthless behavior. Therefore, Conscience is not only a gameplay mechanic but a narrative device that reflects Kratos' inner conflict and character growth.

Section 2: Avoiding Conscience

One way to deal with Conscience is to avoid killing humans altogether. This is a valid option, especially since not all enemies in the game are human, and some can be defeated through non-lethal means, such as stunning or parrying. However, this approach limits Kratos' combat effectiveness and can make certain encounters more challenging, if not impossible. Also, it contradicts Kratos' persona as a warrior, who has a long history of killing his enemies without mercy. Therefore, players who want to fully experience Kratos' fighting style and the game's mechanics should seek a more nuanced approach to Conscience.

Section 3: Conquering Conscience

The ultimate strategy to conquer Conscience involves a combination of gameplay mechanics, equipment, and narrative choices. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Prioritize upgrading Kratos' equipment that enhances his stun and parry abilities. This allows him to incapacitate enemies without killing them, which minimizes the decrease in Conscience.

2. Use Atreus' abilities, such as his arrows and Spartan rage, to support Kratos in battles and weaken enemies. This reduces the need for Kratos to kill humans directly and increases his Connection with Atreus.

3. Choose the dialogue options that show Kratos' remorse for his past actions and his willingness to change his ways. This shows him as a more complex and sympathetic character and reinforces his bond with Atreus.

4. Complete the side challenges and quests that involve freeing imprisoned souls or helping lost spirits. This demonstrates Kratos' compassion and empathy towards the dead and counterbalances his violence towards the living.

By following these steps, players can minimize the impact of Conscience on Kratos' stats and story and create a more nuanced and fulfilling gameplay experience.

Conclusion:

Conquering Conscience in God of War Ragnarok is not an easy feat, but it is a rewarding one. By balancing Kratos' combat skills with his moral values and emotional connections, players can create a more nuanced and relatable character and story. Moreover, by overcoming the Conscience mechanic, they can demonstrate their mastery of the game's mechanics and their empathy towards its message. In the end, it takes more than brute force to triumph in God of War Ragnarok - it takes conscience.

## How to Complete the Conscience for the Dead Favor Quest in GoW Ragnarok
 

 
Here’s a complete walkthrough of this Favor quest that can help you beat the objectives:
 
- Begin the quest after interacting with Gunhild in Cliffside Ruins. Further, take a left turn and climb the wall and jump on the platforms in the left direction. You will then notice that there is a chain attached to the wall but there is no way to climb as it is obstructed by spiky vines. You then have to use Freya’s Sigil Arrow to clear those vines from there.
 - Come down from the platforms so that you can finally climb your way up on those chains. You then have to continue walking on the path and interact with the wall to carve a Rune. This will clear your path to a hidden region, Goddess Falls.
 - After that, head back to your boat and continue moving through the river. Take a left turn right after reaching the Goddess Falls. Further, on that path, you will unlock one more region by the name The Veiled Passage. You are halfway done completing the Conscience for the Dead Favor quest in GoW Ragnarok.

 
- Park the boat and break the wooden wall in the left direction. Once broken, climb the wall on the left side and make your way up on the platform.
 - Make your way a bit deeper until you find the Seidr Spirits. Defeat them all and return back to Gunhild to finish the quest.

 
- You will then be rewarded with XP and Svartalfheim’s Honour Amulet Enchantment, and 13 Whispering Slabs as a reward for completing the Conscience for the Dead Favor in GoW Ragnarok.
