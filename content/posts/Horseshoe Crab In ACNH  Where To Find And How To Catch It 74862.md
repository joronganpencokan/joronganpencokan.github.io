ACNH Players Rejoice: Rare Horseshoe Crab Spotted! Learn How To Catch It Before It's Gone!

If you are an avid player of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, you know the thrill of catching a rare fish or a bug. It's an achievement that can bring immense satisfaction to your gaming experience. And now, you have the chance to catch one of the most elusive creatures in the game - the Horseshoe Crab! 

This ancient creature is known for its unique appearance, and it's one of the rarest critters that you can find in the waters of Animal Crossing New Horizons. With its distinctive shell and spiny tail, the horseshoe crab is definitely a catch worth bragging about. In this article, we will tell you everything you need to know to catch this elusive creature.

First, let's talk about when you can catch it. The horseshoe crab can only be caught from March to April and from October to November. During this time, it can be found scuttling around the shoreline at night, between the hours of 9 pm to 4 am. Make sure to equip a fishing rod before heading out on the search for this elusive creature.

Now that you know when to look, the next step is to find the horseshoe crab. The critter can be found in the water at the shorelines of your island, just like other fish in the game. However, it is not always easy to spot, so make sure to keep your eyes peeled. It is also a good idea to keep your ear out for the sound of a fish nibbling your bait.

When you happen to find the horseshoe crab, make sure to take your time catching it. It's a fast-moving creature, so you need to be quick with your reflexes. Be patient, wait for the horseshoe crab to get closer, and then cast your fishing rod. Once the horseshoe crab takes the bait, reel it in quickly. 

As with all creatures in Animal Crossing New Horizons, you can donate the horseshoe crab to your island's museum for a reward. And, if you're lucky enough to catch more than one, you can sell it to Timmy and Tommy for a hefty sum of 2,500 bells.

In conclusion, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, catching a horseshoe crab is definitely worth the effort. It's a rare and elusive creature that will add to your collection of rare bugs and fish. So grab your fishing rod, head to the shoreline of your island in the dark, and get ready for an adventure. Happy catching!

### How to Catch it?
 
Make sure you have your wet suit on and then go ahead and swim in the ocean. If you don’t have one, buy it from Nook’s Cranny for 3,000 Bells. You can also wear a snorkel mask but it is not compulsory, it is just a cosmetic addition. But a wet suit is absolutely mandatory for a swim.
 
Once you are in the water, look for a medium sized shadow that doesn’t move too fast. Unlike the other fast sea creatures like the Gigas Giant Clam, this one is not going to give you any headache. You can easily dive (by pressing Y) and catch it.
