Introduction

There is no doubt that the font is a critical aspect of web design, and it can make or break your website's aesthetic appeal. However, it is not always easy to identify a font on a webpage. Sometimes, we come across websites that have fonts that leave us feeling impressed, and we wonder what particular font the website used. Luckily, with Google Chrome and some developer tools, you can unlock the secret and discover how to unveil the mysterious fonts on any web page.

Step 1: Check the Developer Tools

The first step is to open Chrome and visit the website whose font you want to identify. Once you are on the site, right-click on any part of the page and select "Inspect” or press "Ctrl+Shift+I" on your keyboard. This action will open the Developer Tools panel.

Step 2: Use the "Elements" Tab

Once the Developer Tools panel is open, you will see several tabs. Click on the "Elements" tab, and you will see the structure of the webpage. On the left-hand side, you will see the HTML source code of the webpage, and on the right-hand side, you will see a preview of the webpage.

Step 3: Find the Font Style Sheet

Next, you have to find the font stylesheet. Scroll down the Elements tab until you find the section that says "Styles" or "Computed." Once you find it, expand the section by clicking on the caret symbol ">" that appears beside it.

Step 4: Locate the Font

Under the "Styles" or "Computed" section, you will see a list of CSS styles used on the webpage. Look for the section that says "font-family." The font family is the name of the font used on the website, and it is usually located in the first or second row.

Step 5: Identify the Font

Once you have located the font family, right-click on it and select "Inspect" or "Open in New Tab." This action will take you to the font family's source, where you can get more information about that particular font.

Conclusion

In conclusion, identifying a font on a web page is not rocket science. With Chrome's Developer Tools, you can easily unveil the mysterious fonts on any webpage. By following these steps, you will have access to the font family's source, which will give you more information about the font, such as its creator, license, and more. Maintaining web design aesthetics can be challenging, but Chrome offers you a simple solution when it comes to identifying fonts on any webpage.

How many times have you come across a type of font on the web that you really liked and wanted to know the name of? Web developers often use tools like Firebug and Webkit for this task, but if you’re not familiar with those or just want something easier, WhatFont is the perfect tool for the job.
 
WhatFont is a Chrome extension that will identify the fonts used on web pages just by hovering your mouse over them. It can even detect the service used for serving the web font (ie. Typekit, Google Fonts).
 

 
Once installed, you’ll need to reload any tabs in your browser that are already open, or go to a new tab. Next, click on the WhatFont browser icon and your mouse will turn into a web font inspector. Then you can hover your mouse over any font on a web page and you will see that font’s name displayed.
 
Clicking on a font will display even more info about it like the size, height and color. When you’re done inspecting the page, click on “Exit WhatFont” at the top right corner to return your mouse point back to its regular state.
