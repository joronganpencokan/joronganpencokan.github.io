Are you struggling to include source code in your Word documents in a professional manner? Do you feel like the code looks messy and is hard to read? This article will guide you on how to embed source code into your Word documents like a pro!

Firstly, it's essential to understand that there are specific tools and programs available that make embedding source code into documents more manageable. One such tool is the "GitHub Gist" program, which allows users to embed code snippets easily. This program is free to use and highly user-friendly.

To embed a code snippet using GitHub Gist, follow these simple steps:

1. Navigate to your preferred code editor, such as Atom, Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text, and open the source code file you want to embed.
2. Select the code snippet that you want to include in your Word document.
3. Once you've selected the code snippet, copy it to your clipboard by right-clicking and selecting "Copy."
4. Open GitHub Gist in a new tab and sign in using your GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can create one for free.
5. Click on the "New Gist" button and paste your copied code into the editor.
6. Add a filename, description, and any other details that you wish to include.
7. Once you're satisfied with your entry, Click "Create Gist."
8. Copy the embed code generated by the program.
9. Back in your Word document, navigate to the location where you want to embed the source code.
10. Click on the "Insert" tab and select "Object" from the dropdown list.
11. In the box that appears, select "Create from File" and then "Browse."
12. Select the location where your code is saved and click "Insert."
13. Finally, click on "OK," and your code will be successfully embedded in your Word document.

Once you've embedded the code, you may want to adjust its appearance to make the reading experience better for your audience. You can use "Syntax Highlighting" to improve the readability of your source code. Many programs offer this feature, including GitHub Gist.

Syntax highlighting is the process of displaying text using different fonts, colors, and styles to differentiate between different components of programming languages. This technique helps improve readability, making it easier for others to understand the code.

To use Syntax Highlighting in GitHub Gist, follow these steps:

1. Open your Gist and select the code file you want to highlight.
2. Click on the "Raw" button, which will display a version of the code that you can copy.
3. Copy the code and paste it into a text editor program.
4. Save the file with a ".txt" extension.
5. Open the saved file and enable "Syntax Highlighting."
6. Adjust the colors and fonts to your preference.
7. Copy your highlighted code and paste it back into your Gist or Word document.

In conclusion, embedding source code into Word documents is not as complex as it may initially seem. By utilizing tools such as GitHub Gist and applying Syntax Highlighting, you can embed code in your documents and improve its readability. Give it a try and impress your colleagues with your pro-level coding skills!

This article explains issues with using source code in Word for Microsoft 365, Word 2019, Word 2016, Word 2013, Word 2010, and Word 2007 and instructions for embedding a second document in a Word file. It also provides information on pasting other data into a Word document.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- To embed a second document into a Word document: Insert > Object > Create New > Word Document > clear Display as icon > OK.You can also use Paste Special to insert a variety of data into a document, including code.

 
##   The Problem With Using Source Code in Word  
 

Programmers write software programs using languages such as Java, C++, and HTML. Programming languages use different formatting and symbols from regular languages, so pasting a snippet of code into Word from a programming application causes errors such as text reformatting, indentation shifts, link creation, and misspellings.

 

Given how Microsoft Word structures documents, inserting and working with source code is more difficult than working in a dedicated code editor. However, document embeds create a container that protects source code from being reformatted.

 

One way to avoid these formatting issues is to paste the source code into a separate document within the main Word document.

 
##   Embed a Second Document Into a Word Document  
 

Here's how to paste source code into a Word document using a second embedded document.

 
- Open the target document in Microsoft Word and place the cursor where the source code will appear.
 - Select Insert.
 - In the Text group, select Object.
 - In the Object dialog box, select the Create New tab.
 - In the Object type list, Select Microsoft Word Document.
 - In Word 2007, select OpenDocument Text.
 - Clear the Display as icon check box.
 - Select OK.
 - A new document opens, titled Document in [target document file name]. Save the document in the same folder as the target document.
 - Copy and paste the source code into the new document. Word automatically ignores the spaces, tabs, and other formatting problems. Spelling errors and grammatical errors are highlighted in the document, but these errors are ignored when the code is inserted in the original document.
 - Save and close the source code document. The source code appears in the main document.
 - Resume work on the main document.

 
##   Using Different Paste Types in Word  
 

The most up-to-date versions of Word handle code better than they used to. Word for Microsoft 365 supports several forms of pasting, including with and without source formatting. So pasting a block of code from, for example, Microsoft Visual Studio Code will look different based on the paste type. If you select Paste Special, each of the three options yields a different result:

 
These instructions only work with a single page of code.
 

Open the target document in Microsoft Word and place the cursor where the source code will appear.

 

Select Insert.

 

In the Text group, select Object.

 

In the Object dialog box, select the Create New tab.

 

In the Object type list, Select Microsoft Word Document.

 
In Word 2007, select OpenDocument Text.
 

Clear the Display as icon check box.

 

Select OK.

 

A new document opens, titled Document in [target document file name]. Save the document in the same folder as the target document.

 

Copy and paste the source code into the new document. Word automatically ignores the spaces, tabs, and other formatting problems. Spelling errors and grammatical errors are highlighted in the document, but these errors are ignored when the code is inserted in the original document.

 

Save and close the source code document. The source code appears in the main document.

 

Resume work on the main document.

 
- Unformatted Text: All code is pasted as unformatted, so you'll lose indenting, color, typeface, and related contextual clues.HTML Format: From VSC, a paste-as-HTML renders what appears to be a photo of the code, complete with the text editor's background color. This code block is editable, and you can remove the background color in the Paragraph Fill menu option.Unformatted Unicode Text: Pastes the text as is but strips the text and background colors. Re-format the code as needed.

 
- How do I see formatting marks and codes in Word?
 - To see formatting marks and codes in Word temporarily, go to Home and select the Show/Hide icon to toggle marks on and off. To keep them on permanently, go to File > Options > Display > Show all formatting marks > OK.
 - How do I add links in Word documents?
 - To add a link in a Word document, highlight the text you want to hyperlink, right-click it, and select Link. Alternatively, select Insert > Links > Link and enter the URL.
 - How do I convert a Word document to HTML?
 - To convert a Word document to HTML, go to File > Save As. Under Save as Type, choose .html. You can also use an editor like Dreamweaver.
