Are you frustrated with grinding for hours just to level up in Astral Chain? Look no further, as we have the ultimate guide to leveling up lightning fast!

Before we dive into the secret hacks, let's first understand the basics of leveling up in Astral Chain. To level up, you need experience points (XP), which you earn by defeating enemies, completing missions, and discovering new areas. Once you accumulate enough XP, you level up and gain access to new abilities, upgrades, and items.

Now, without further ado, here are the secret hacks to level up quickly in Astral Chain:

**1. Focus on chaining combos**

To maximize XP gain, focus on chaining combos during combat. The longer your combo, the more XP you earn. Try to switch between Legion attacks and your own attacks to keep the combo going. Don't forget to use Sync Attack, which deals massive damage and adds a multiplier to your combo.

**2. Complete side quests**

Side quests are an excellent source of XP and often offer unique rewards that can boost your combat abilities. Always keep an eye out for new side quests and prioritize them.

**3. Use the right Legions**

Each Legion in Astral Chain has unique abilities that can help you in combat and increase your XP gain. For example, the Arrow Legion is excellent for taking down airborne enemies, while the Beast Legion is perfect for close combat. Experiment with different Legions and use them strategically to maximize your XP gain.

**4. Use the XP boosters**

There are numerous XP boosters scattered throughout Astral Chain, including consumables, items, and equipment. Use them wisely, especially during boss fights or challenging missions, to level up quickly.

**5. Explore new areas**

Exploring new areas unlocks new missions, enemies, and items. You can also gain XP by discovering hidden pathways and secrets. Take your time to explore each area thoroughly, and don't be afraid to backtrack to find any missed opportunities.

By implementing these secret hacks, you can level up lightning fast in Astral Chain and unlock new abilities, upgrades, and items. Remember to prioritize chaining combos, complete side quests, use the right Legions, use XP boosters wisely, and explore new areas.

Now, go forth and become a master of the Astral Plane!
