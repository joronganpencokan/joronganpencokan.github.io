# Say Goodbye to Your Console: Project Xcloud PC Beta Will Blow Your Mind!

Are you tired of being tethered to your bulky console just to enjoy your favorite games? Do you envy PC gamers with their flexibility and control but don't want to give up on console exclusives? Then you'll be glad to know Project Xcloud PC Beta is here to revolutionize the gaming industry once again.

## What is Project Xcloud?

Project Xcloud is Microsoft's cloud gaming service that lets you stream high-quality games to any device, be it your tablet, phone, or computer. Using the power of Azure technology, Xcloud provides seamless gameplay with minimal lag, delivering a console-like experience on your internet-connected device.

Initially launched for Android devices, Xcloud has now expanded to include the PC platform, allowing more gamers to enjoy the service's benefits. With the PC Beta, you'll get access to a vast library of games, including console exclusives like Forza, Halo, Gears, and many more.

## Why You Need to Try Project Xcloud PC Beta

If you're still skeptical about cloud gaming and whether it can replace your console or PC, here are some reasons why you should give Xcloud PC Beta a try:

### Flexibility and Convenience

With Xcloud PC Beta, you don't need to buy a new console or upgrade your PC to enjoy the latest games. All you need is a stable internet connection, a compatible controller, and you're good to go. Whether you're at home or on the go, you can access your game library and continue playing where you left off without worrying about hardware limitations.

### No Downloads or Updates

One of the biggest headaches of the gaming experience is waiting for downloads and updates to complete. With Xcloud PC Beta, you won't have to deal with that anymore. Since games are streamed, you can start playing within seconds without waiting for installations or patches. This also means you won't have to worry about storage space as all games are stored on Microsoft's servers.

### Quality and Performance

One of the misconceptions about cloud gaming is that it sacrifices quality for convenience. However, with Xcloud PC Beta, that's not the case. Games are streamed at 1080p and 60 frames per second, delivering smooth and responsive gameplay. Plus, the service adjusts to your internet connection, ensuring that you get the best possible experience regardless of your location.

### Affordable and Accessible

If you're a budget gamer, Xcloud PC Beta is one of the most affordable options available. Instead of having to invest in expensive hardware, you can pay a low monthly fee for access to a vast library of games. Plus, since the service is available on multiple platforms, you can save money by not having to buy games twice.

## How to Sign up for Xcloud PC Beta

If you're interested in trying out Xcloud PC Beta, you can sign up by visiting the official Project Xcloud website. Keep in mind that the service is still in beta, so there may be some bugs or issues that need to be worked out. However, by participating in the beta, you'll get early access to new features and improvements, making it a worthwhile experience.

In conclusion, Project Xcloud PC Beta is a game-changer for the gaming industry, providing a flexible, affordable, and seamless alternative to traditional consoles and PCs. With the ability to play on any device with a stable internet connection, you'll have more control and convenience than ever before. So say goodbye to your console and hello to the future of gaming.

I guess I won't need an Xbox to play my Xbox now, which feels a little peculiar.

 
### 
Key Takeaways
 
- Xbox Game Pass already was one of the best values in gaming, and now you can run it in a web browser.Cloud gaming, in general, is heavily weighted in game publishers' favor.You'll still want to go physical or digital for any game with a strong multiplayer component.

 

I got into the PC/iOS beta for Microsoft's newest version of Project xCloud, which lets Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers play their games via browser or web app. With Google Chrome and a compatible controller, I now have access to a huge number of Xbox games, without actually having to launch the Xbox app or turn my console on.

 

It makes playing games on Xbox faster and more convenient than it was before, by virtue of the Xbox unit, itself, being surplus to requirements. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers already had the previous version of xCloud as a perk, letting you play Xbox games on Android mobile devices, but this opens up the field.

 

It's still cloud gaming, though, and still comes with the current state of the field's complications. The shift to the cloud is a great deal for publishers, but still feels like it could leave consumers behind.

 
##   In Before You Know It  
 

It's hard to argue with the sheer dollar-per-hour value of Xbox Game Pass right now. For $15 a month, you get access to a rotating, curated assortment of first- and third-party Xbox games, including several recent releases.

 

The advantage with xCloud over Game Pass on console or PC is that it doesn't require any kind of local installation. You simply can click and play an installed copy of the game on Microsoft's cloud server, which puts you in-game in 3 minutes or less. This also means you can play high-definition games on a low-end machine, because it's essentially an interactive video stream.

 

I ran the xCloud PC beta through its paces with an assortment of games, including Killer Instinct, Xeno Crisis, Wolfenstein: The New Order, and State of Decay 2. In Wolfenstein's case, I was able to seamlessly pick up a run from where I'd left off on my physical Xbox, thanks to automatically syncing save data.

 

For the most part, I couldn't tell any real difference between playing a game via xCloud on browser or a local installation. The exception was State of Decay 2, which I'm assuming has a lot to do with its need to stay connected to the game's server during play. While I got a fair distance into the game’s solo campaign, I had consistent problems with "floaty" and imprecise controls.

 
##   Storm Warning  
 

That's one of the big issues with cloud gaming: it's a bandwidth hog.

 

Multiplayer games, or anything that stays connected to a server while you play, are going to measurably suffer if you try to play them via the cloud, as your local Internet tries to maintain both connections simultaneously. It's possible, but it's not ideal, and you're a walking target for anyone else in-game.

 

That also means you're using up a lot of data. You can count on burning at least 100MB per minute spent on an xCloud game, depending on its graphics settings. It's entertaining to play Halo 5 at 4K on an iPhone, but you've got about 4 seconds before you hit your monthly data cap.

 

It's not without its conveniences, but the logistics for cloud gaming aren't there yet. Since Google got this ball rolling in 2019 with Stadia, I've noticed the general thrust of most of the enthusiasm built up around the cloud, at least in the gaming space, is that it's an amazing deal for a big tech company—all you have to do is keep your servers running—but it's situationally useful, at best, for players on the ground.

 

Microsoft has some smart ideas going into xCloud, where it's a useful option for Game Pass subscribers rather than a product in itself, but the entire cloud-based gaming model seems to be designed for a version of the internet that doesn’t presently exist. 

 

It's a solution in search of a problem.
