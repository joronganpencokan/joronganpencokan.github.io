Do you often get annoyed when your iPhone screen keeps turning off while you’re using it? If yes, you’re not alone! Many iPhone users face this problem, but the good news is that there are ways to keep your screen from turning off, and we’re here to help.

In this article, we’ll be unveiling some of the secrets to never letting your iPhone screen off. By following these tips, you can become a phone pro and ensure that your iPhone screen stays on for as long as you need it to.

## Enable Auto-Lock

The first step to keeping your iPhone screen on is to enable the Auto-Lock feature. This feature automatically locks your iPhone after a certain period of inactivity, helping you save battery life. However, you can customize the settings to set a longer time for the Auto-Lock feature.

To enable this feature, go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock, and select the time period you want your iPhone screen to stay on for.

## Use Guided Access

Guided Access is another helpful feature that allows you to lock your iPhone screen on a particular app or feature. This feature is particularly useful if you’re using your iPhone for a specific task, such as navigation or reading.

To use Guided Access, simply go to Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access and turn it on. Once it’s enabled, open the app you want to use, triple-tap the home button, and select “Start” to lock the screen.

## Utilize the AssistiveTouch Feature

The AssistiveTouch feature is another tool that can help you keep your iPhone screen on for as long as you need it to. This feature adds a floating button to your screen, allowing you to access various functions without having to use the physical buttons on your iPhone.

To enable this feature, go to Settings > Accessibility > Touch > AssistiveTouch and turn it on. Once it’s set up, you can access the button at any time by tapping on it, and use it to keep your iPhone screen on.

## Download a Third-Party App

If the built-in features on your iPhone aren’t enough, you can always download a third-party app that can help you keep your screen on. Apps like Stay Alive and Wakey offer various features that allow you to keep your iPhone screen on while using specific apps or during certain tasks.

To download these apps, simply go to the App Store, search for the app, and download it onto your device. Once it’s installed, follow the instructions to enable the feature you want to use.

## Final Thoughts

In conclusion, there are various ways to keep your iPhone screen on, whether it’s by enabling the built-in features or downloading a third-party app. By following these tips and tricks, you can become a phone pro and ensure that your iPhone screen stays on for as long as you need it to.
