SHOCKING: Revealed! The Top Secret Way To Uncover EVERYTHING Google Knows About You!

It's no secret that Google tracks your activity online. From your search queries to the websites you visit, the tech giant collects a vast amount of information about you. But just how much do they know about you? And how can you access this information?

In this article, we will reveal the top-secret way to uncover everything Google knows about you.

Step 1: Sign in to Your Google Account

To access the wealth of data that Google has on you, you need to be logged in to your Google account. You can do this by going to Google.com and clicking on the "Sign in" button in the top right corner of the screen.

Step 2: Go to Your Google Account Page

Once you're signed in, click on your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen and then click on "Google Account." This will take you to the Google Account page.

Step 3: Access Your Google Data

Scroll down to the "Data & personalization" section and click on "Download, delete, or make a plan for your data" under the "Download, delete, or make a plan for your data" section. This will take you to a page where you can access all the data Google has on you.

Step 4: Review Your Google Data

On this page, you'll see a list of different categories of data that Google has collected about you, including your search history, location history, and YouTube history. Click on any of these categories to see the data that Google has collected.

Step 5: Download Your Google Data

If you want to download a copy of the data that Google has collected about you, click on "Download your data" at the top of the page. This will allow you to select the categories of data that you want to download and the format in which you want to receive the data.

Step 6: Delete Your Google Data

If you want to delete the data that Google has collected about you, click on "Delete a service or your account" under the "Delete a service or your account" section. This will allow you to select the category of data that you want to delete, or you can choose to delete your entire Google account.

Conclusion

By following these simple steps, you can uncover everything that Google knows about you. It's important to note that while Google may collect a lot of data about you, they do so to improve their services and provide you with a better user experience. If you're concerned about the data that Google has collected about you, you can take steps to delete it or adjust your privacy settings to limit the amount of data that Google collects moving forward.

Imagine her shock when I told her how much other information Google stores about her as well. Even telling her how to stop Google from saving her search history didn’t cheer her up.
It’s an unfortunate reality that if you use Google services, Google has more information on you than you think. That means Gmail, Google Contacts, Google Docs, Google Calendar and other Google applications, along with Android.
The good news is that you can find out how much of your information has been logged with Google. The better news is that you can download all that information to your computer for your personal records so you don’t lose it in the cleanup.
Google Takeout is a service from Google that tells you how much information Google has about you. It’s a quick way to see your “Google footprint” across 15 Google services, with more on the way.

Your footprint can be composed of your browsing history, contact information, emails and any other information that is being stored on Google’s servers. That could add up to a lot of info.
I’ll warn you now that it took me about six hours to get my information. Fortunately, you don’t have to do anything while it’s collecting. Just be patient and the service will let you know when it’s done. Once the information arrives, you can download it.
Services like Google Takeout don’t just shed a little light on what’s going on behind the scenes of Google’s user tracking, they also teach us about exactly how much of our personal info is being tracked. You really should check this out.

 
## Download instructions


Go to the Google Takeout page using my blue link buttons below and click “Create Archive” to get started.

It may take a while for Google to fetch all the data, so just be patient. If you’re really active on the web, it can take up to several hours.
You’ll be notified by Google through text or email when your information is ready to download. Click the “My Archives” link to download the zip file to your computer.
Your information will be divided into folders, so you can find your contacts, your mail, your pictures and everything else that Google has through your profiles.
