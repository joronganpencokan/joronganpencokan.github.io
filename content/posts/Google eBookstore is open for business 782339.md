What is Google Play Books?
Google Play Books is a subscription service that allows readers to access thousands of books from top publishers for a monthly fee.

With other services, you may be limited to a certain number of books per month or per year. With Google Play Books, you'll have access to as many books as you want for one low monthly fee.

How much does it cost?
Google Play Books is a monthly subscription service that costs $9.99 per month in the US. However, Google is offering a 30-day free trial for new subscribers, and you can cancel anytime. For the price of two paperbacks, you can access unlimited books.

What books are included?
Google has partnered with top publishers to offer a wide variety of books from best-sellers to classics. You'll find books from Penguin Random House, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, HarperCollins, Macmillan, and more. With Google Play Books, you can read books in a variety of genres, including fiction, non-fiction, romance, and mystery.
