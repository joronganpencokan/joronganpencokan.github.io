Title: Unlock the Secret to Dominating Valorant with a Left-Handed Gun - Expert Tips Inside!

Are you one of the many left-handed players struggling to dominate in Valorant? With the majority of in-game weapons optimized for right-handed players, it can be challenging to excel as a lefty. However, the solution might be simpler than you think - using a left-handed gun.

In this article, we'll discuss how swapping to a left-handed gun can improve your gameplay and provide expert tips on mastering this technique.

Benefits of Using a Left-Handed Gun

Firstly, using a left-handed gun will place the ejection port on the left-hand side, providing you with an unobstructed view of your target. This means you'll be able to aim and shoot more accurately, without having to worry about spent casings flying in your face.

Secondly, using a left-handed gun can increase your reaction time as a lefty. Since most weapons have right-handed controls, lefties need to shift their hand position or take their thumb off the movement keys to change their weapon. This takes valuable time and can make a significant difference in a fast-paced game like Valorant. By using a left-handed gun, you'll be able to switch weapons faster and get back to the game quicker without compromising on your movement.

Mastering the Left-Handed Gun Technique

Now that you understand the benefits of using a left-handed gun, it's time to master the technique. Here are some expert tips on how to do it:

1. Practice with a left-handed gun in the practice range - start by using the left-handed gun in the practice range and get used to the feel of it. Focus on your aim and shooting accuracy before moving onto actual gameplay.

2. Choose a left-handed gun that suits your style – while most weapons are not available in a left-handed version, some are. The Bulldog and Guardian rifles have left-handed versions that may suit your style of play.

3. Change your keybinds – adjust your keybinds to make the switch between weapons easier. For example, you can bind the left-handed gun to a specific key to switch between weapons faster.

4. Experiment with different grips – find a grip that feels comfortable and allows you to aim accurately. Some left-handed players may prefer a different grip than right-handed players.

Final thoughts

Using a left-handed gun can improve your gameplay and give you an edge over other players. With practice and the right techniques, you can master the left-handed gun technique and dominate in Valorant.

So go ahead, give it a try, and unlock the secret to dominating Valorant with a left-handed gun. We hope these expert tips help improve your gameplay and take your skills to the next level. Good luck!

Valorant is a tactical First Person Hero Shooter game created by Riot Games. Even though you play as one of the many Agents on the Roster, you are primarily going to kill your Enemies with Guns. FPS games like Valorant tend to design their guns in such a way that it feels natural for Right-Handed players. Not all players are Right-Handed & not many are Ambidextrous. So in this guide, I will show you How to Make your Gun Left handed in Valorant.
 
## How to Make your Gun Left-handed in Valorant
 

 
On the Global release of the game, Valorant didn’t have a Left Handed viewing option. This all changed in patch 1.11 where this feature was introduced. To gain the Left Handed viewing option, perform the following steps.
 
- Once the game has opened up, go to your Settings.
 - You can do this by hitting the ESC Key or clicking the Cog Wheel Button on the Top Right of your screen.
 - In your Settings, go to the General Tab.
 - Now scroll down till you can find the Other section.
 - The first option under the Other section is First Person Handedness.
 - This is the Setting you will have to change to switch between Right Handedness & Left Handedness.

 
That is how you can switch between Right Handedness & Left Handedness in Valorant. This is a big help to our Left Handed players but can also be an advantage for our Right Handed players. If you are mechanically skilled, you can switch between First Person Handedness to help you in clearing angles. Doing this allows you to move your gun away from the part of the screen that you want to clear. As of now, there is no way to set your First Person Handedness on a Keybind.
