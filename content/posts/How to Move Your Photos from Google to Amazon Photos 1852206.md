Unlock the Secret to Seamlessly Transferring Your Treasured Pics from Google to Amazon Photos!

In today's digital age, most of our cherished memories are captured through the lens of our smartphone camera. From family vacations to special occasions, we capture these moments in our photo galleries to relive them in the future. As we accumulate more and more photos, it's essential to have a reliable backup solution to ensure that our treasured memories are safe from accidental loss or damage. Two of the most popular photo storage services are Google Photos and Amazon Photos. 

Google Photos is a free cloud storage platform that offers an unlimited storage option for high-quality photos and videos. On the other hand, Amazon Photos provides a paid subscription plan that offers storage for both photos and videos and comes with perks such as unlimited photo storage for Prime members. While both services have their advantages, it's not uncommon for users to switch from one platform to another. 

If you're considering making the switch from Google Photos to Amazon Photos, you may feel apprehensive about the transfer process. Migrating all your photos from one platform to another can be a tedious and time-consuming task, especially if you have a substantial photo gallery. However, the good news is that the process can be made much simpler if you know how to do it the right way. 

Here's how to transfer your photos from Google to Amazon Photos:

Step 1: Download your Google Photos

The first step to transferring your photos is to download them from Google Photos. To do this, you'll need to access your Google Photos account and select the photos you want to transfer. Once you've selected your photos, click on the download button, and all your selected photos will be saved in a zip folder.

Step 2: Upload your photos to Amazon Photos

Once you've downloaded your photos, the next step is to upload them to Amazon Photos. To do this, log in to your Amazon Photos account and click on the 'Upload' button. A window will pop up that will allow you to select the zip folder you saved your photos to. After selecting the folder, it will upload to Amazon Photos, and all your photos should now be available in your Amazon Photos gallery.

Step 3: Organize your photos

Finally, you'll want to make sure that all your photos have been correctly transferred to Amazon Photos, and they are organized the way you want. Amazon Photos has built-in organizing features such as face recognition, object and scene detection, and automated album creation that can help sort your photos. You can also create custom albums and share them with family and friends. 

By following these simple steps, you can seamlessly transfer your treasured pics from Google to Amazon Photos, ensuring that they are safe and accessible for future memories. So, what is stopping you from making the move to Amazon Photos today? Start by downloading your Google Photos, uploading them to Amazon Photos, and organizing them the way you want. With Amazon Photos, you'll have access to your photos from anywhere, and you'll never have to worry about losing them again.

## Download and Export Pictures from Google Photos
 
1. Navigate to Google Takeout where all your Google data is stored.
 
2. You will see a massive list of app data from all the apps you use. Click on “Deselect all” because it’s much faster than doing each one independently.
 
3. Scroll down until you find Google Photos and check the box next to it. If you want to download specific albums or other formats, click on Multiple formats and All photo albums included buttons. Deselect the items you do not want.
 
4. Scroll to the very bottom to find and click the “Next step” button.
 
5. Choose your delivery method. I used the option to deliver a download link to my email because I know there are many pictures there. Leave the other options – export type, file type, and archive size – as they are and click “Create export.”
 
2. Open the file and launch the installation. Click Install. The application should launch automatically after you install it. Open it if it doesn’t launch.
 
5. You will be asked to choose the folder where you want to save the photos. You can even create a new one.
 
To use Free up space on Google Photos, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Google Photos app.
 
2. Tap on the profile picture icon at the top followed by “Free up space.” The app will let you know if all of your photos are backed up before you take this action.
 
Also, open the Google Photos app Settings, turn off the “Back up & sync” option by tapping it. If you don’t do this, you will have backups in both places, which may not be a bad thing.
