# Unleash Your Inner Marksman: Here's How to Dominate Every Boss in Gunfire Reborn!

If you're a fan of first-person shooter games, it's likely that you've stumbled upon Gunfire Reborn. This game is an exciting, fast-paced shooter that will challenge you to become the ultimate marksman. However, to dominate every boss in the game, you need to hone your skills and apply the right strategies. In this article, we'll show you how to unleash your inner marksman and become a boss-slaying beast in Gunfire Reborn.

## 1. Choose Your Character Wisely

When you first begin Gunfire Reborn, you'll have four unique characters to choose from, each with its own abilities and playstyle. To succeed in Gunfire Reborn, you need to choose the character that suits your playstyle. If you prefer a hit-and-run approach, the Cat character might be the best for you. If you want to focus on close-quarters combat, the Dog character might be the perfect pick. That being said, experiment with each character to determine which one suits you.

## 2. Never Stop Moving

In Gunfire Reborn, survival is about never standing in one place for too long. Bosses are incredibly deadly, and they can quickly take you down if you're not careful. Always keep on the move, strafing and dodging around the battlefield is crucial. If you find yourself in a tight spot, use your dodge move to get behind cover or escape danger. Jump and fire, use your abilities in mid-air to avoid incoming fire and hit your targets.

## 3. Use Your Abilities

Each character in Gunfire Reborn has unique abilities that can change the tide of battle if used strategically. For example, the Cat's Ultimate ability can slow down time, giving you an advantage in a battle. Don't be afraid to experiment with your abilities and find the best way to use them. Don't forget to also upgrade your abilities by spending your soul essence in the right places.

## 4. Upgrade Your Weapons and Stats

In Gunfire Reborn, your weapons and stats are your primary sources of power. Upgrading your weapons with better attachments like scopes, extended magazines, or increasing their base damage with Ether can make all the difference. Upgrading your stats like max health, Armor, critical strike chance and key decreases the amount of damage or increase the chances of defeating bosses. It's essential to make smart choices when it comes to allocating your soul essence points as well.

## 5. Work together with a team

Gunfire Reborn is primarily a solo experience, but you can play through the game with up to three other players. Working together as a team can make a tremendous difference in the game. Combining abilities and strategies can help you take down bosses faster and more efficiently. Form your team wisely and communicate to achieve victory and help each other navigate through the map.

With these five tips, you're on your way to dominating every boss in Gunfire Reborn. Remember to choose your character wisely, always keep moving, use your abilities strategically, upgrade your weapons and stats, and work together with a team if possible. Most importantly, have fun and revel in the thrill of victory!

This Boss guide will help you beat every boss there is in Gunfire Reborn. So let’s check out this guide and see how to do it.
 
## How to Beat Every Boss in Gunfire Reborn
 
While none of these bosses are easy to beat, the challenge to defeat them will be a fun experience. Before we start with each boss, we have listed all the bosses that you will come across in the game. Here’s every boss that you will have to defeat in Gunfire Reborn:
 
Table of Contents
 
- Lu Wu
 - Golem (Optional Boss)
 - Ichthyosaurus Offspring
 - Wind God (Optional Boss)
 - Yoruhime-Maru
 - Abyssal Serpent (Optional Boss)
 - Pole Monarch

 
### How to Beat Lu Wu
 

 
Lu Wu is the first boss you will encounter in Gunfire Reborn. While he won’t be that hard, taking this boss leniently will be fatal for you. To beat the boss Lu Wu in Gunfire Reborn, the key thing will be distance. Here are the tips and tricks that you need to remember against this boss:
 
- The key to this fight is having some distance. While his attacks are not close range, the distance will still help you avoid them.
 - You need to constantly attack him while he charges up his attacks and dodge or dash.
 - While we are at this, below are the attacks that you need to watch out for.
 - Boulder Throw – He will charge his gauntlet and throw boulders at you. You can dodge them by waiting till the red circle appears and then dashing to one side.
 - Fireball – He will aim the gauntlet towards you and shoot a fireball-like attack. Move to one side to dodge this.
 - Leap Attack – Lu Wu will jump towards you and smash the ground where he lands. Move to one side if you are at a distance. If the leap is from a closer distance, dash towards him. That is from where he jumped.
 - Ground Pound – This is when you are up close. He will charge the Gauntlet and then slam it on the ground. To avoid this, dash backward.

 
### How to Beat Golem (Optional Boss)
 
- Boulder Throw – He will charge his gauntlet and throw boulders at you. You can dodge them by waiting till the red circle appears and then dashing to one side.
 - Fireball – He will aim the gauntlet towards you and shoot a fireball-like attack. Move to one side to dodge this.
 - Leap Attack – Lu Wu will jump towards you and smash the ground where he lands. Move to one side if you are at a distance. If the leap is from a closer distance, dash towards him. That is from where he jumped.
 - Ground Pound – This is when you are up close. He will charge the Gauntlet and then slam it on the ground. To avoid this, dash backward.

 
Golem is an optional boss who unlocks when you beat Lu Wu five times in Gunfire Reborn. Beating the Golem will take some good timing on your behalf. We recommend you take a rifle for this boss. Here are the tips and tricks you need to remember against Golem:
 
- He will use chest beams which you need to dodge by hiding behind the pillars. If you have no pillars, a perfectly timed dash will help you counter the attack.
 - Next, he will destroy the pillars and respawn them. So do watch out for the red circles. Later on in the game, he will make the pillars explode for close range damage and then respawn them.
 - You need to also be careful of rocks that he will spawn in the air. Shoot them as soon as you can. While you can hide behind the pillar to dodge them, they will break the pillar which will remove your shield against the chest beam.
 - Another attack is when he will throw his arms at you. You will see two red circles and you need to time your dodge to avoid this.
 - Lastly, keep shooting him in the eye or the chest. These are his weak points with chest being the easier of the targets.

 
### How to Beat Ichthyosaurus Offspring
 
Ichthyosaurus Offspring will take us to the desert region of Gunfire Reborn. This boss is significantly easy to beat. And while distance was key for the first two bosses, that is not the case here. Here’s all you need to remember to beat the boss Ichthyosaurus Offspring in Gunfire Reborn:
 
- He has two weak points, his head and his tail. Mid fight he will go underground and then his tail will come out.
 - The tail has two attacks, one where it shoots acid like balls which you must avoid. The second one is a tail slam which you can dodge by moving to the sides.
 - He also shoots laser beams with his mouth that you can avoid by moving in one direction. However, move closer to the boss while this attack is in motion. This will help you avoid being hit.

 
This Guide is still a Work in Progress and we will update it soon with tips and tricks for the remaining bosses. While you are here, we have more guides that may catch your attention at Gamer Tweak.
