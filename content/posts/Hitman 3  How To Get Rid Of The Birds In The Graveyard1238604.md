Secret Trick Revealed: Eliminate Pesky Birds in Hitman 3 Graveyard Mission with Ease!

Are you also finding it frustrating to complete the Hitman 3 graveyard mission because of those pesky birds? Yes, birds can make things difficult for players. But don't worry, we have got you covered with our secret trick to eliminate pesky birds in the Hitman 3 graveyard mission with ease!

The Hitman 3 graveyard mission takes place in the beautiful city of Berlin, where you play the role of Agent 47 sneaking up on a group of enemies. The mission involves eliminating these enemies without getting caught, but the tricky part is the presence of those annoying birds in the area. The birds flying around the graveyard can alert the guards, making it harder for you to sneak up on them and take them down.

Now, let's talk about our secret trick to eliminate those pesky birds. The trick lies in using the environmental objects located in the graveyard to your advantage. One of these objects is the stone water fountain that is located in the center of the graveyard.

To make use of this trick, you need to approach the water fountain in a sneaky manner and make sure that none of the guards are nearby. Approaching stealthily is important as it allows you to reach the fountain without getting caught. When you reach the fountain, you will find that there is a sprite bottle beside it.

Now, the critical part is to aim at the bottle using an appropriate weapon like a silenced pistol or any other silent weapon. You need to shoot the bottle with precision, and as soon as you hit it, the water fountain will turn on, making a loud noise that will scare away all of the pesky birds in the area.

Once the birds have been scared away, you can proceed to take down your enemies without worrying about getting detected. This trick eliminates the need for you to eliminate the birds one by one, which can be time-consuming and risky.

In conclusion, the secret trick to eliminate pesky birds in the Hitman 3 graveyard mission is to use the environmental object of the water fountain and the sprite bottle beside it. Shooting the bottle will turn on the water fountain significantly, scaring away all the birds in the area, making it easier for you to complete the mission.

Next time when you play the Hitman 3 graveyard mission, remember to use this trick and eliminate your enemies with ease. Happy gaming!

As Agent 47, you will have challenging tasks involving subduing enemies, eliminating targets and more. But there are also objectives where you should know how to get rid of the birds in Hitman 3. The birds in question are in a graveyard during the Dartmoor section of the game. In this guide, we will explain how to get rid of the birds nesting in the graveyard without making a mistake.
 
## How to Get Rid of the Birds in Hitman 3?
 
You can get rid of the birds by using a silenced pistol at the right time and while choosing the right place in the graveyard. From the correct location next to a brick wall, shoot the bird nests which will make the birds fly off.
 
But all of this needs to be done very carefully. You will be wearing a disguise of a detective but a detective doesn’t simply appear with guns blazing. So, make sure you have a weapon but it’s a silenced one.
 

 
Next, you have to enter the graveyard and find such a place where you can shoot all nests from. That’s the brick wall where you need to crouch and use your gun.
 
Now if you shoot the birds, that will not solve the problem. You have to shoot the nests for them to really go away. After you do that, make sure to sneak out because the gardener will know that something is going on. It will be even more challenging if you are on a higher difficulty.
 
That’s basically what you need to do to clear the area of noisy birds. Then you can continue your mission to lure your target and go in for the kill.
 
Now that you know how to get rid of the birds in Hitman 3, find out more about other missions in our Hitman 3 guides. Plus find out how to get the silenced Sniper Rifle, know all shortcut locations and how to get the secret ending in the game.
