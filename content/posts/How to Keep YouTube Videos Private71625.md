Title: Secret Revealed: The Ultimate Guide on How to Keep Your Youtube Videos Private!

Youtube is a great platform for sharing videos with the world, but sometimes you may want to keep your videos private. Whether it is for personal or business reasons, keeping your videos away from the public eye can be crucial. So, how can you ensure that your Youtube videos remain private? Here's the ultimate guide on how to do it!

1. Private or Unlisted

There are two options available to you when it comes to keeping your Youtube videos private. You can either make them private or unlisted. Private videos are only visible to you and the people you choose to share them with. Unlisted videos, on the other hand, are not searchable and can only be viewed by people who have the link.

2. Adjusting Your Video's Privacy Settings

To make your video private or unlisted, you need to adjust your video's privacy settings. You can do this by going to your YouTube Studio and selecting the video you want to make private or unlisted. Then, click on the "Visibility" option and select either "Private" or "Unlisted."

3. Invite People

To share your video with specific people, you need to invite them to view the video. You can do this by clicking on the "Share" button and adding their email addresses. Once you invite them, the video will be available for them to view.

4. Add or Remove People from Access List

You can add or remove people from your access list at any time. To do this, go to your YouTube Studio and select the video for which you want to change the access list. Then, select "Edit" next to the "Visibility" option. You can now add or remove people from the access list.

5. How to Share Unlisted Videos

If you want to share your unlisted video with someone, you need to share the link with them. You can do this by clicking on the "Share" button and copying the link. You can then share this link with anyone you want.

6. Keeping Your Videos Private

Keeping your videos private is important to ensure that they do not fall into the wrong hands. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can keep your videos private and only share them with the people you want.

In conclusion, keeping your Youtube videos private is easy if you know how to do it. By adjusting your video's privacy settings, inviting people to view the video, and sharing the link to unlisted videos, you can ensure that your videos remain private. With this ultimate guide, you now have all the tools you need to keep your Youtube videos away from the public eye.

Some people only want to share their YouTube videos with friends or they might even want to keep them completely private. No matter the reasoning, YouTube makes it easy to change the privacy setting on an uploaded video or prevent a video from going public even before it's uploaded.

 
##   Change YouTube Video Privacy Settings During Upload  
 

If you haven't uploaded your video yet, but you're in the process or about to start the process, follow these steps to make sure it isn't shown to the public.

 
See our guide on YouTube's privacy settings to learn more about other options that pertain to comments, ratings, and more.
 
- Sign in to your YouTube account and navigate to YouTube Studio.
 - Select Upload Video and choose the file you want to upload to your YouTube account.
 - Enter details such as the title and description and select Next.
 - On the Visibility screen, select one of the following options to make the video private:
 - Unlisted: Keep your video public but don't allow people to search for it. This lets you easily share the URL with anyone you want but prevents people from finding it through search results.
 - Private: Doesn't let the public see the video. Only you can see it, and only when you're logged in under the same account that uploaded the video. This option makes YouTube work more like a video backup service rather than a sharing service.
 - Select Save.

 
##   Change YouTube Video Privacy on Existing Videos  
 

Your other option is to make your existing videos private. That is, to pull your video out of the public eye and make it obey one of the options mentioned above.

 
You can always change the setting later, as you can see in the next section.
 

Sign in to your YouTube account and navigate to YouTube Studio.

 

Select Upload Video and choose the file you want to upload to your YouTube account.

 

Enter details such as the title and description and select Next.

 - From the drop-down menu, choose one of the following options to make the video private:

##   Differences Between Private, Unlisted, and Public Videos  
 

Private, Unlisted, and Public videos all have different features. Compare these characteristics to determine which setting is best for your needs.

 

Select Videos in the left pane under Your Channel.

 
To see your live uploads, select the Live tab.
 

Hover over the video you want to update and select the arrow under Visibility.

 
To apply the same privacy setting to all of your videos, choose the Select All checkbox in the upper-left corner of the video list. Alternatively, select the checkboxes next to the videos to which you want to apply the same privacy setting.

##   Unlisted YouTube Videos Posted Before 2017  
 

Google updated some older unlisted YouTube content in July 2021 to take advantage of new security enhancements. Unlisted videos posted before January 1, 2017 automatically became private videos instead. People could opt out of this change if they wanted to keep their videos unlisted, but those clips don't benefit from the security improvements.

 

If you didn't opt out and your older unlisted videos became private, you can make the videos public or re-upload them as new unlisted videos using the steps outlined in this article.

 
Any data associated with the original unlisted videos, such as views or comments, won’t carry over to the new uploads. If the videos are embedded on a website, you must update the links so they point to the newly uploaded videos.
