# Experience Windows 10 like never before - Watch our Hands-On Video Review of Build 16273 and Discover the Exciting New Changes Today!

The operating system is the backbone of any electronic device, and Windows 10 stands as the most widely used operating system in the world. Microsoft continuously updates Windows 10 to provide better performance, feature enhancements, and an overall smoother experience for users. With the release of Build 16273, Windows 10 takes significant strides towards becoming the most user-friendly and powerful operating system on the market. 

Though there are many small changes in Build 16273, the majority of them are hidden under the hood, improving system performance and stability. However, some significant user-facing changes will make you feel like you are using a brand-new version of Windows. Our hands-on video review of Build 16273 covers the most significant changes for you to see and experience for yourself.

The first change you'll notice is the new Fluent Design System. It's a fresh and modern look that makes Windows 10 blend with other devices using the same design language. The Fluent Design interface creates stunning transitions and animations that bring the system to life. It looks more pleasant to the eyes, with a bright palette, and a clean, modern feel. The Fluent Design update is still in progress, but in Build 16273, the differences are striking.

One of the significant pain points in Windows 10 is the Settings app. It's powerful, but some people do not use it frequently because of its confusing layout. With Build 16273, Microsoft has made the Settings app much more user-friendly, easier to navigate, and more intuitive. The new interface has a much more straightforward design, making it easier for users to quickly get to the setting they need without the need for constant scrolling.

If you like customization, you'll love the new Start menu improvements. You can now resize the Start menu to your liking or switch it to a more tablet-friendly, simplified layout. The new design introduces pre-made themes that you can quickly choose from to update your system's look and feel.

One of the most exciting new features in Build 16273 is the added support for a power throttling feature. It's a power-saving mode that reduces the processing power of background apps, giving less priority to those that do not need it. In practical terms, it means that your system will operate more efficiently, and you will experience better battery life.

Finally, the updated taskbar will be much more usable, with quick access to the apps or files relevant to your current task, making it easier to get everything you need in one place. The new taskbar, together with the improvements to the Start menu and Settings app, creates a cohesive user experience that is both functional and easy to use. 

In conclusion, Build 16273 is an impressive update that contains improvements that matter, rather than minor visual tweaks. The Fluent Design System provides a much-needed refresh to the Windows 10 interface, improving the interaction with the system overall. The changes to the Settings app and the Start menu help users get the most from the system quickly, and the power throttling feature introduces the potential for better battery life. 

Now that you have an idea of what Windows 10 Build 16273 has to offer, it's time to experience it for yourself. Check out our hands-on video review and discover the exciting new changes today!
