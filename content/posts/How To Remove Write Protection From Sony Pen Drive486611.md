If any USB device is write-protected, we can’t format, delete or move contents stored in it. If you try to delete or move the content, it will display an error message like ‘Disk is write-protected’, ‘Remove the write protection’, etc.
Since we can’t access the write-protected flash drives, we need to remove the write protection first to make it accessible. Usually, flash drives often have a write protection switch, so make sure to check you’ve got the ‘lock’ switch in the correct position. Sometimes, the switch gets moved to the locked position when we insert it to a smartphone, camera, or any other device. So, make sure this isn’t happening.
