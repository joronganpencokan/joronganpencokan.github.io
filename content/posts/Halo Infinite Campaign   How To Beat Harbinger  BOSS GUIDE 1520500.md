Title: Unleash Your Inner Master Chief: Learn How to Conquer the Harbinger in Halo Infinite's Epic Campaign!

Introduction:

Halo Infinite has finally arrived, and gamers all over the world cannot stop raving about how epic the campaign is. The game immerses players in a breathtaking open-world environment and lets them experience the ultimate adventure as they battle the alien forces. One of the most challenging missions in Halo Infinite is to defeat the Harbinger, one of the toughest bosses in the game. But fear not! With our tips and tricks, you can unleash your inner Master Chief and conquer this formidable enemy.

Section 1: Get Prepared

Before you take on the Harbinger, make sure that you are well-equipped to face the challenge. Upgrade your weapons and armor to the maximum level, and ensure that you have enough resources to replenish them during the fight. Select the right equipment for the mission, such as a warthog or a gunship, and recruit allies to join your team. Having co-op players can be a significant advantage, as they can provide valuable support and assistance during the encounter.

Section 2: Master the Harbinger's Attack Patterns

The Harbinger is not your ordinary enemy. It is one of the most challenging enemies in the game, and defeating it requires precision and strategy. To emerge victorious, you need to master the Harbinger's attack patterns and learn how to counter them effectively. The Harbinger has a variety of attacks, including its primary weapon, the harpoon. It uses the harpoon to grab and pull gamers toward it, leaving them exposed to its other attacks. To counter this attack, dodge and roll out of the Harbinger's grip and use weapons that deal significant damage.

Section 3: Exploit the Harbinger's Weaknesses

The Harbinger may seem invincible, but it has its weaknesses that you can exploit to emerge victorious. The Harbinger's energy shield is one of its significant weaknesses that you can exploit. Use weapons that deal damage to the shield, such as plasma grenades, to weaken its defenses. Once the shield is down, use weapons that deal massive damage, such as rockets or railguns, to deal the final blow.

Section 4: Time Your Attacks

Timing is crucial when fighting the Harbinger. You need to time your attacks correctly, or else you might leave yourself exposed to its deadly attacks. Keep moving and dodge the Harbinger's attacks while you wait for the right moment to strike. Wait until it stops attacking and exposes its weak spots, then unleash your most potent attacks to deal maximum damage.

Conclusion:

Facing the Harbinger in Halo Infinite is not an easy feat, but with the right preparation and strategy, you can emerge victorious. Follow these tips and tricks to unleash your inner Master Chief and conquer this formidable enemy. Remember, always be prepared, learn the Harbinger's attack patterns, exploit its weaknesses, and time your attacks correctly. With these techniques, you'll be well on your way to becoming a Halo Infinite legend.

### How to Beat Harbinger – Explained
 
To get to Harbinger, you will have to first get through her Minions. That should not be a problem as they are the enemies that you have been facing throughout Halo Infinite. Well, this is true for the First & Second Phases of the Harbinger Boss Fight. In the third phase, you will have to face a Brute Chieftain who wields a Gravity Hammer in Halo Infinite. The best way to deal with the Banished Enemies is by maintaining distance and kiting around them while you take each of them out. There will be weapons available around the arena so don’t worry about running out of Ammo.
 
The First & Second phases of the fight are pretty easy but when you reach the third phase, it gets challenging. The Brute Chieftain will appear in the first half of the Third Phase and will chase you with his Gravity Hammer. You will need to use the Arena’s Verticality as he will be able to 2 hit KO you. Keep your Distance and slowly chip away at his Health.
 
Now let’s Talk about Harbinger, the second halves of each phase in the Boss Fight in Halo Infinite Campaign. In each phase, she will be inactive at the start. This is the time where you have to defeat the waves of Banished Enemies. After clearing them, she will exit from her Golden Aura and will come to attack you. She is very agile and quick so never stands in one place. Grappleshot and Thruster are your Best friends here. At first, use the Sentinel Beam to destroy her Shields. Once that is done, you will be able to deal damage to her Health. After a certain point, she will reset by going back into the Golden Aura state, and from here is where the next phase begins.
 
Every time a new phase begins, Harbinger will enter into battle with a full shield but her Health doe not get restored. This is not a Speedrun so taking your time is advised. Also at the tops of the Gallery (Balcony) like platforms, you will be able to refill the Sentinel Beam gun.
 
Follow these steps and you will be able to Beat Harbinger in Halo Infinite Campaign very easily. Hopefully, this guide has helped you in getting the needed information on beating this Boss Fight.
