Harry Potter fandom has been around in this world for over two decades now & why is it still famous around wizards and muggles? Because of the wizarding world created by Rowling. There are 7 books and around 8 film adaptations to the installment with the last movie divided into two parts (Deathly Hallows Part 1 & Part 2). “But clearly, Fame isn’t everything. Is it Potter?” In these years, different spin-off novels, video games, and mobile games spanned across the hands of Muggles. Let’s look at all the Harry Potter PlayStation games so far.
 
## All Harry Potter PlayStation Games So Far
 
Here’s are all the Harry Potter games on PlayStation.
 
Table of Contents
 
### Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone
 
In this installment of the series, Harry makes his best friends, and learns about the existence of “that who shall not be named”. Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s or Sorcerer’s stone is a third-person action-puzzle game, and its gameplay for the PlayStation version varied from the PC version. The game was more influenced by the movie rather than the books. You have to choose one out of the 4 houses at the beginning of the game. Although the game was bashed by critics for its graphics, it was the highest-selling video game by December 2001.
 
### Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
 
Its gameplay was almost similar to its predecessor game with some additions like learning the spells and how to ride a broomstick. Harry Potter and Chamber of Secrets was an upgrade to the first game in terms of graphics and gameplay on the PlayStation. It was mostly received positively among the critics.
 
- Available on PS2.

 
### Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
 
This is one of the most important parts of the Harry Potter series as this is when Harry finally meets his Godfather (no spoilers). Overall, Prisoner of Azkaban is a short game to complete. Its PS and PC versions varied from each other like the previous ones. What I love about this game is that you can also switch and play as Harry’s friends- Hermione and Ron. With each of the three having unique abilities, you can also combine your spells for a bigger impact.
 

 
### Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
 
This is the first Harry Potter game that is more action-based than any of its predecessors. It involved less puzzle solving and more of the storyline. The graphics of the game were a big upgrade and the characters resembled more to their film counterparts. You can play one of the three characters that you can choose at the beginning of the game. As you choose one out of three characters, the other two become your supporting NPCs for collaborative spells. These three characters include Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The game also added multiplayer mode for the first time in the installment series which allowed the players to invite friends.
 
### Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
 
For all the players waiting to explore the world of Hogwarts with free roam, Order of Phoenix is a treat for all the fans. This game involves recruiting members for the Dumbledore Army and wreaking destruction like the Weasley brothers when Umbridge replaces Dumbledore. This game also gives you a rare opportunity of playing as Sirius Black and Dumbledore during certain duels in the storyline. The game included Room of Rewards which featured trophies and several behind-the-scenes (videos) from the production.
 
### Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
 
This is my favourite installment out of the Harry Potter series. The graphics were improved but were quite similar to the previous game. You can play one out of three characters in the series. These include Harry, Ginny, and Ron. The critics had mixed responses to the game with most of the critics not liking the addition of quests in the game. Some of the cast members of the movies like Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), and Ginny (Bonnie Wright) lent their voices for the first time in the game.
 
### Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – P1
 
I wish I could use the obliviate spell to forget this game. As Harry and his friends mature into growing adults, the developers of the game decided to go with a darker tone. In this game, you will explore the world outside Hogwarts as Harry and his friends embark on their hunt for Horcruxes. You can give headshots to Death Eaters, Dementors, and several creatures of the wizarding world. But can you imagine a third-person shooter game with wands? This is where things went haywire for the game. Although the game was praised for its dark aesthetics, the audience and the critics did not approve of its action-based gameplay. The game received heavy negative responses from the audience as well as critics.
 
 
 
- Available on PS3.

 
### Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – P2
 
Taking remarks from the predecessor game, the developers tweaked and modified the gameplay of Deathly Hallows Part 2 into lesser evil than the first part. In this game, your spells function as different types of guns. For instance, if you cast Stupefy spell it will function as a pistol. Other spells function as different guns too. You can switch between controlling several characters like Neville, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, and more. The game is mostly story-based and does not include any side missions. Almost to the showdown, Harry receives the ability to Apparate (teleport) in defence against Voldemort. But despite their efforts, the game could not fit as a notable conclusion to the video game series.
 
## Harry Potter PlayStation Games (Spin-Offs) So Far
 
Here are all spin-off Harry Potter games available on PlayStation
 
### Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup
 
Apparently, something bad and dramatic always happens at Quidditch sports. The Quidditch sport involves four positions which are Seeker, Chaser, Beater, and Keeper. You can either play in Hogwarts involving the four houses of Hogwarts or you can have a match against other countries in World Cup mode. This World Cup mode includes several national teams with the addition of Victor Krum as a star player from Goblet of Fire. Or you can play an Exhibition match which is a 1v1 Quidditch game against a national team. You can also fly your broomstick and face-off against your friend in a multiplayer mode in an Exhibition match.
 
### Lego Harry Potter: Years 1–4
 
The game features and covers the first four adaptations of the Harry Potter series in a Lego style. These include Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s stone, Chambers of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, and the Goblet of Fire. You can play your favourite characters in Lego stylized forms. The game received a positive response from the critics as well as the general audience.
 
### Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7
 
Like the previous Lego Harry Potter, this game adapts the final three books and four movies in a lego style. It was praised well by the critics for its humorous cut-scenes and soundtracks.
 
### Lego Harry Potter (Collection)
 
It is a compilation of both the Lego Harry Potter games for PS4 players. These games include all the DLCs in both games and are remastered for better graphics.
 
### Book of Spells
 
### Book of Potions
 
This game too like Book of potions is an AR game that starts with the player choosing a house and a wand. This game is based on a book written by a potion maker Zygmunt Budge of the Potterverse. The game involves a student of Hogwarts finding the Book of Potions and learning the art of brewing potions as you proceed.
 
## Bonus
 
### Hogwarts Legacy
 
Hogwarts Legacy is an upcoming action and roleplaying game where you can explore the magical open world in the 1800s. The game will also let you choose your house and other decisions as morality system will be included in this game.
 
If you are Potterhead and you loved the movies more than the books you can watch Harry Potter: Return to Hogwarts. It is a documentary featuring a reunion of all the cast members along with J.K Rowling. The documentary will feature insights, behind-the-scenes of the cast, and bloopers. It will be fun to watch the cast reunite after more than a decade.
