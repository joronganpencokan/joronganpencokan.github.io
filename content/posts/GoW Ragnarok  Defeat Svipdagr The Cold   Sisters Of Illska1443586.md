These Berserkers are going to be one of the most chilling encounters by Kratos. Check out this guide that features the steps to defeat three of these bosses in GoW Ragnarok.
 
## How to Defeat Svipdagr the Cold & Sisters of Illska in GoW Ragnarok
 

 
You will encounter them in the Barrens region of Alfheim. All three of them are going to test your durability as this is what the entire battle depends upon. Svipdagr & the Sisters of Illska (Hromundr the Cruel and Vottr the Prideful) show up at the same time on the same battlefield. So defense is going to be a key factor in this fight. It is recommended to attach the Rond of Purification to the Shield before fighting them.
 
Rond of Purification will help you to reduce the damage incurred from the elemental damage. Though Svipdagr won’t do any elemental damage in GoW Ragnarok but stay aware of the Sisters of Illska’s fire and ice damage combo respectively. A wise decision here will be taking on Svipdagr the Cold first. Decimating her will eliminate the threat of being attacked at close range.
 
Ensure that you have all three of them in your line of sight. This is because, when you will be busy taking on the Svipdagr, the Sisters of Illska will try to attack you from distance. Hence, keeping all three of them, in the vision will help you to dodge accordingly. Also, most of the time, they shout something so you will eventually know that they are about to attack.
 
Once you have successfully defeated Svipdagr, you can shift all your focus on the Sisters of Illska in God of War Ragnarok. Hitting either of the Sister will damage the other one. Once you have eliminated one of them, the other Sister will be stunned and vulnerable to the special R3 attack.
 
The battle is going to be a bit lengthy so there are lots of windows for charging up Sparta’s Rage. Further, make sure to use it whenever you can and heal whenever you see a health orb. As mentioned above, durability is the key factor in winning the battle.
