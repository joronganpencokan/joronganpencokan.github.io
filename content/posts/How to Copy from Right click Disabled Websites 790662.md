Are you tired of not being able to copy content from websites that have disabled the right-click option? Fear not! There is a secret trick that can unlock the ability to copy text, images, and other content from these websites.

This technique involves using the "Inspect Element" option in your web browser. Here are the steps to do it:

Step 1: Open the webpage that you want to copy content from.

Step 2: Right-click on any part of the page and select the "Inspect Element" option (or press Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows or Cmd+Option+I on Mac).

Step 3: This will open the Developer Tools window. Don't worry if it looks complicated, just focus on the selected element in the window.

Step 4: Once you have the Developer Tools window open, press Ctrl+Shift+C (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+C (Mac) to activate the "Element Selection" tool.

Step 5: With the "Element Selection" tool active, hover your mouse over the content that you want to copy. The content will be highlighted in the Developer Tools window.

Step 6: Right-click on the highlighted content and select "Edit as HTML". This will open the HTML code for that content in the Developer Tools window.

Step 7: Now you can copy the code by highlighting it and pressing Ctrl+C (Windows) or Cmd+C (Mac).

Step 8: Paste the code into a text editor or word processor and clean up the code as needed.

Step 9: Finally, format the text or images as you like and use it for your own purposes.

It's important to note that this technique should only be used for personal use and not for commercial purposes or copyright infringement. Always respect the owner's rights and permissions for their content.

In conclusion, the "Inspect Element" option is a powerful tool that can unlock the secret trick to copying content from websites with the right-click option disabled. Use it wisely and ethically, and enjoy the freedom to copy content that you need.

Copy Text From a Protected Web Page: Copying others’ work is not ethically right, we understand this. However, curating content and giving proper citations to the source of the content is legal and the ethically right way. As a blogger or content writer, we all curated content from multiple websites, but we do not steal it, rather we give credit to those websites if we post their content. However, not all people are the same, so their purposes of copying content are different. There are people who simply copy and paste others’ hard work without giving proper citations and credits. This is not acceptable. Therefore, to spot the plagiarism in internet content, most of the website owners have started putting a Javascript code to prevent copying of content from their websites.
 

 
They simply put a code that disables the “Right-click” and “Copy” options on their website. Usually, we all are accustomed to select content by right-clicking and selecting copy. Once this feature gets disabled on the websites, we are left with one choice & that is to leave the website and find another source to copy that particular content. The Internet is a source of getting relevant information about any topic. In the race of protecting the content on the website, website administrators are activating the content protection features.
 
The Javascript code disables both the right-click and text selection and some of these websites also show a notice when you right-click which says something like this “Right-Click on this site is disabled“. How to deal with it? Have you ever experienced this problem? Let’s find out some ways to crack the problem and get answers about how to copy from right click disabled websites in Chrome.
 
## Effective Ways to Copy from Right Click Disabled Websites
 
If you are using the Chrome browser, you have some options that can help to copy content from the copy-protected website. Most of the website administrators use javascript code to avoid copycats to steal their content from the website. That Java code simply disables the Right-Click and Copy feature on that website.

It is the most important etiquette of copying content from other websites. Yes, copying is not a bad thing, because when you find that particular website has informative content, you will be intrigued to copy and share it with others in your group. However, when you copy and present it as your own work, it is illegal and unethical, therefore, copy it and give the credit to the original writer of the content. All you need to do is disable the protection Javascript code from the website which is stopping you to copy the content even when you are ready to give them credit. Happy content-copying!
