Are you a Genshin Impact player who's been wondering how to unlock some insane rewards? Well, look no further because linking your accounts is the key!

Linking your accounts in Genshin Impact can provide you with incredible rewards that you won't get anywhere else. From special characters to in-game currency, the benefits of linking are too good to pass up.

So, what exactly do you need to do to link your accounts? Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

## Step 1: Open the Paimon menu

The first step is to open the Paimon menu. You can do this by hitting the "Esc" key on your PC or by tapping the Paimon icon on your mobile device.

## Step 2: Go to the "Settings" menu

Once you're in the Paimon menu, look for the "Settings" option. It should be easy to find as it's usually located at the bottom of the menu.

Once you're in the Settings menu, scroll down until you see the "Account" option. Click or tap on that option to proceed.

## Step 4: Choose your platform

The next step is to choose the platform you want to link your account to. For example, if you're playing Genshin Impact on PC, you should choose the "MiHoYo Account" option. If you're playing on your mobile device, select the respective platform.

## Step 5: Login to your account

After you've chosen your platform, you'll need to log in to your account. If you're creating a new account, you'll need to fill in the necessary details.

Genshin Impact is available across multiple platforms including mobile, PC, and PS4, and will soon be available on Switch as well. Hence, the developers have long added a cross-save feature in the game. You can simply link your Genshin Impact accounts on PC and mobile to seamlessly switch between platforms.
 
There is no cross-save functionality available for PS4 currently. Hopefully, this might change in the future, but for now, only PC and mobile players can link their accounts to enjoy the game on both platforms.
 
## Genshin Impact: How Can I Link My Accounts
 
You can link accounts in Genshin Impact by heading to Settings>Account<User Center and then hitting the “Link” option. This will send an email to the address associated with the Genshin Impact account. The sent email address will have a verification code. When you enter the code from the email into the verification section of the game, your account will be linked.
 

 
Linking accounts will let you experience the game on both platforms without the need to explore from the start. You can simply play on the PC, save the game, and then use mobile to continue playing from where you left. You can also link your Genshin Impact accounts with the help of social media platforms including Game Center, Facebook, Twitter, and others.
