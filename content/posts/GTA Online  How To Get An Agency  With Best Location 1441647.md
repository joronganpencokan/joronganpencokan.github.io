# Get the Ultimate GTA Online Advantage: How to Score the Elite Agency Location and Dominate the Game!

If you're a GTA Online player, you know that location can mean the difference between success and failure. And there's no better location in the game than the Elite Agency. This prime real estate will give you a serious advantage over other players, so let's take a closer look at how to secure it and dominate the competition.

## What is the Elite Agency?

The Elite Agency is located in the Rockford Hills neighborhood of Los Santos, and it's a prime location for high-end buyers looking for luxury properties. But in the world of GTA Online, it's much more than that. The Elite Agency is a building that serves as a spawn point for players, as well as a convenient location to start missions and heists.

While the Elite Agency doesn't have any special features or benefits that other properties don't, its central location makes it a highly sought-after location.

## How to Score the Elite Agency

First things first, you need to have enough money to purchase the Elite Agency. At $1,000,000, it's not the most expensive property in the game, but it's not cheap either. If you're new to the game or don't have that kind of cash lying around, you'll need to do some grinding to save up for it.

Once you have the money, head to Dynasty 8 Real Estate and find the Elite Agency on the map. Purchase it, and it's yours!

## Dominating with the Elite Agency

Now that you have the Elite Agency, it's time to put it to good use. The building serves as a spawn point, so you'll always start at your property when you log in or respawn after a death. This can be especially useful during missions or heists when you need to regroup quickly.

The Elite Agency's central location also makes it a great place to start missions or heists. You won't need to travel far to get to your destination, saving you valuable time.

But the real advantage of the Elite Agency is its visibility. Because it's located in such a high-profile area, it's easy to spot from a distance. This makes it a popular place for players to gather, which can lead to impromptu battles or alliances. Being at the center of this action gives you an excellent opportunity to get to know other players and potentially form alliances that can give you even more of an advantage in the game.

## Conclusion

In the world of GTA Online, location is everything, and the Elite Agency is one of the most coveted locations in the game. Its central location, visibility, and convenient spawn point make it a prime location for missions, heists, and alliances. So if you're ready to take your game to the next level, save up your cash, score the Elite Agency, and dominate the competition!

### Best Location to Buy an Agency
 
Most of the players purchase the most expensive agency, Hawick which costs $2,830,000. The majority of the players think that the most costly one is probably the best agency to purchase. That is not true, in GTA 5, the agency is considered to be the best if it gets you more contracts. Luckily in GTA Online, Lost Seoul which is the cheapest among all the agencies is the perfect agency that is closer to most of the contracts in the game. There are lots of missions near the Lost Seoul that offers recovery missions for Assets, vehicles, and other valuables. It is also closer to the Rescue missions and the Liquidized Assets. Overall, Lost Seoul is the ideal location to purchase an agency in GTA Online as it gives the highest Return on Investment.
