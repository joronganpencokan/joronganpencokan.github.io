# 10 Astounding Hacks to Skyrocket Your Stash Size in The Division 2 – Never Run Out of Space Again!

Are you constantly running out of space in your stash while playing The Division 2? No need to panic anymore! We've got some hacks that will help you skyrocket your stash size and never run out of space again. So, get ready to boost your stash capacity and enjoy playing this game without any hassle.

## Tip 1: Convert Unused Gear

Are you hoarding unused gear in your inventory? Don't waste that gear, instead of converting it to crafting materials to free up some space in your stash. Highlight the specific gear you no longer need, and then press "convert" to gain new crafting materials in return.

## Tip 2: Check Your Mods

Mods can take up a considerable amount of space in your inventory. Take some time to go through your mods and delete the ones you're no longer using or those that aren't relevant to your play style. This will free up space for more crucial items.

## Tip 3: Take Advantage of the Recalibration Station

The Recalibration Station is the best place to strip attributes from items you don't need and apply them to other armors or weapons that you use frequently. This not only helps to increase your stash capacity, but it also provides a more personalized experience of gameplay for you.

## Tip 4: Sell Items

Sell the items that are not necessary or unwanted. Selling items will give you a small amount of in-game money, and you can use this money to buy new gear or stash expanders. 

## Tip 5: Upgrade Your Stash

Upgrading your stash is an essential step towards maximizing your stash size. Head over to the Quartermaster and buy a Stash Upgrade. This will increase the amount of space you have in your stash by 30.

## Tip 6: Use Extra Characters

Every account has up to four characters that you can create. Each character has its own stash, and you can use them accordingly. You can move items from one character's stash to another, and this will help you manage your materials or gear for each character better.

## Tip 7: Use Your Backpack Efficiently

Make sure you're using your backpack efficiently. The backpack should always contain critical items that you'll be using frequently. Anything that is not necessary should be stored in your stash.

## Tip 8: Move to a Safehouse

The Base of Operation is the main hub for all players in The Division 2. Moving to a safehouse is a convenient option that can save you time when accessing your stash. Deploy a stash at a safehouse to make it more accessible to you.

## Tip 9: Craft a Better Backpack

Crafting a better backpack could be one of the best solutions for increasing your stash size. A premium backpack allows you to carry more items and ultimately frees up your stash capacity for other items.

## Tip 10: Use Loot Shield

Loot Shield is a feature in the Division 2 that helps you protect your items from accidental selling or dismantling. This will ensure that you don't lose anything valuable that you may have collected during your gameplay.

In conclusion, these hacks will help you manage your stash better and increase your stash capacity in The Division 2. With the above tips, you'll never run out of space again!
