Currency is always an important factor in no matter what game we talk about. In Crusader Kings 3, without money, you cannot build a building or perform any activity that can help you extend your empire. Hence, it is significant to know how to make money in Crusader Kings 3. Well, if you are wondering how to do that, you are at the very right place. This guide will walk you through different methods to make money in Crusader Kings 3.
 
## Crusader Kings 3: How To Make Money
 
There are three primary ways to make constant money in the game. You can find all the three ways when you hover over your mouse over the money tab while in the game. Here are all three ways and how you generate income from them.
 
### Domain
 
Domains are all the lands that come under your empire, i.e., you directly own them. These domains give you most of what they earn. Hence, you can make a decent amount of money in Crusader Kings 3 through domains.
 
### Vassal Taxes
 
To manage your realm, you will need vassals, and these vassals will pay you taxes. They collect taxes from their vassals and pay it to you in the form of liege taxes which are again vassal taxes for you. The most amount of money that you collect in the game comes from this source.
 
### Church Holdings
 
Collecting money from church holdings is not certain. This money comes from the holders of churches in your area. You can only get money from church holdings only if your religion is Theocratic.
 
There are also some secondary ways to make money in Crusader Kings 3. One of these ways is through your steward. Stewards and collectors are responsible for collecting taxes in your region. Hence, based on their levels, stewards can give you a decent amount of money.
 
The other way to make money in Crusader Kings 3 is by looting. You can raid any nearby kingdom and defeat it to loot gold from there. You can also loot captives from the kingdom where you are raiding. Captives can then be sold back to the defeated king based on the importance of the captives to the king.
 
Those were the different ways to make money in Crusader Kings 3. Talking about the looting, you should move your capital in CK3 to a secure place to prevent someone else from raiding you. This can save a lot of money and captives.
