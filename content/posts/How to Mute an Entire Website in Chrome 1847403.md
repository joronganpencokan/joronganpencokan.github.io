# You'll Never Have to Listen to Annoying Website Sounds Again: The Ultimate Guide to Muting Websites on Chrome!

Have you ever visited a website and suddenly been startled by loud and annoying sounds? It's a common and frustrating experience, but luckily, there's a solution: muting websites on Google Chrome.

Many websites have audio elements embedded into their pages, which can sometimes be desirable for users. However, there are also many times when website sounds can be a nuisance, especially when they play automatically without warning. Fortunately, muting websites on Chrome is easy, and this guide will show you how to do it.

Step 1: Launch Google Chrome
To start, launch Google Chrome and navigate to the website with the audio element you wish to mute.

Step 2: Locate the Sound Icon
Look for the speaker icon that appears on the tab with the audio. If there are multiple tabs open, you may need to hover your mouse over each tab until you find the one with the sound icon.

Step 3: Right-click and Mute Site
Once you have found the tab with the sound icon, right-click on the tab, and select "Mute Site" from the drop-down menu to turn off all sound on that website. Alternatively, you can click on the speaker icon to temporarily mute the audio.

Step 4: Manage Muted Sites
To manage muted sites, click on the three dots in the top-right corner of Chrome, and select "Settings" from the drop-down menu. Next, scroll down to the "Privacy and security" section, and click on "Site settings," followed by "Sound."

From here, you can view all currently muted sites and remove any from the list. You can also manage sound settings for individual sites by clicking on them and adjusting the slider to control the volume.

Step 5: Install An Extension for More Control
If you want even more control over website sounds, you can install an extension like Muter, which allows you to mute all websites by default and then selectively unmute them as needed. This can be especially useful if you want to avoid forgetting to mute a website again in the future.

In conclusion, muting websites on Chrome is a simple process that can save you from dealing with annoying website sounds. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily control audio on individual sites and manage settings for all muted sites. Plus, with the added bonus of third-party extensions like Muter, you can take even more control over your browsing experience.

Gone are the days when you could surf a website without fear of an ad popping up suddenly and blaring a sales pitch at you on full volume. Nowadays every page on the Internet has several video and audio media links embedded in them, just waiting to automatically start playing the moment you start scrolling down the page.
 
Fortunately, Google Chrome provides a way for you to mute an entire website in one go so that any media that starts playing does so silently. Here are two methods you can use to perform this function.
 
## via Site Tab
 
1. Go to a website that features auto-playing videos.
 

 
2. Go to the top of the browser and to the tab of the window that you have currently opened. Right-click the tab.
 
A list of options will appear in a pop-up menu. Look through the options until you find the “Mute Site” option and select it.
 
You might not notice any immediate change, but your new setting has been saved by Chrome. From now on, any page you open that belongs to that website will be muted by default. You can do this for as many sites as you want.
 
3. If you want to turn audio back on for the site, repeat the steps mentioned above until you reach the pop-up menu.
 
This time you will see the option “Unmute Site” in place of the previous option you selected. Choose this option, and the audio for the site will be restored.
 
## Via the URL Address Bar
 
1. Once again, start by going to a site that features audio files that you wish to mute.
 
2. Next to the address of the site in the address bar at the top of the browser is a padlock icon. Click on the padlock to access a new list of options related to navigating the site.
 
3. Go to the last item on the menu list, which is the Settings option next to the Gear icon, and hit Select.
 
A new page will open in a new tab which carries the list of browser permissions the site uses while displayed on your device.
 
4. Scroll down until you find the Sound option. Next to the option is the list of actions you can take relating to the website’s sound profile.
 
The Sound option is usually set as Automatic by default, meaning audio files on the site automatically start playing when you open the site. Click on the drop-down menu to the right of Sound and choose Mute. The website will have its audio muted from then on.
 
If you wish to restore sound, repeat the above steps and choose the Automatic option for sound this time.
 
## Conclusion
 
These two simple methods are a great way to target specific sites you wish to hear less from, instead of having to constantly lower or mute your speaker’s audio every time you visit the site. Even though the pop-up ads will continue to run in the background, you can simply scroll past them without having to look at or hear the ads launch into their sales spiel.
