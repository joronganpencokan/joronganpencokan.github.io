title: You Won't Believe What Android 6.0 Marshmallow Has in Store for You – All the New Features Revealed!

Android 6.0 Marshmallow is arguably one of the most anticipated versions of Android OS ever. Following up on Android 5.0 Lollipop, Marshmallow is set to bring some serious improvements to the table. In this article, we’ll be looking at some of the newest features that Android 6.0 Marshmallow has in store for you.

Android Pay

One of the biggest updates for Android Marshmallow is the introduction of Android Pay, Google’s answer to Apple Pay. Android Pay will allow users to make purchases directly from their phones, without needing to use a credit or debit card. Simply add your card information to the Android Pay app, and make your purchase with a touch of your finger.

Google Now on Tap

Google Now on Tap is another major update. With this feature, Android will pull up relevant information for the user based on their current activity. For example, if you’re listening to a song on Spotify, you can ask Google Now on Tap for more information about the artist, and you’ll receive a wealth of information, including the artist’s bio, upcoming concerts, and more.

Doze

Doze is a new feature that aims to improve battery life. Android 6.0 Marshmallow will learn when the user is using their phone and when it’s idle. When it is idle, the phone will go into a deep sleep mode that minimizes battery use. The result is longer battery life without sacrificing performance.

App Permissions

App permissions are becoming increasingly important as smartphone users become more aware of the amount of personal information that apps collect. With Android 6.0 Marshmallow, users have even more control over the permissions they grant. They can choose to grant or deny certain permissions on an individual basis, without having to grant all requested permissions.

Direct Share

Direct Share is a simple feature that allows users to share content directly with their most frequently used contacts. For example, when sharing a photo, the user can select certain contacts and the photo will be sent directly to them. This saves time and makes sharing content even easier.

Final Thoughts

Android 6.0 Marshmallow is set to provide users with a wealth of new features that will make using a smartphone even more pleasurable. From Android Pay to Doze and Direct Share, the latest version of Android is set to be the most feature-packed yet. Whether you’re a heavy smartphone user or just someone who likes to stay up to date with the latest tech, Android 6.0 Marshmallow is undoubtedly worth the upgrade.

Android 6.0 Marshmallow is now launched, along with the Google Nexus 6P (made by Huawei), Google Nexus 5X (made by LG), and the Google Pixel C tablet.
 
The new version of Android, the Android 6.0 Marshmallow is not revolutionary like its predecessor, the Android 5.0 Lollipop, but still, like always, it comes with some revamped and brand new cool features, with some security and privacy enhancements.
 

 
Some of the features will mean more to the developers that make the apps, but there’s plenty still for Android phone and tablet users to look forward to.
Here is the list of everything that’s new on Android 6.0 Marshmallow:
 
Contextual Assistance
 
- Now on Tap: get assistance without having to leave what you’re doing—whether you’re in an app or on a website. Just touch and hold the home button.
 - Do more with your voice. Now you can have a dialogue with any of your apps that support the new voice interaction service. For example, if a user says “play some music on TuneIn,” TuneIn will respond by asking “What genre?”.
 - Direct Share: a fast and easy way to share to the right person in the right app.

 
Battery
 
- Doze: when your device is at rest, Doze automatically puts it into a sleep state to increase your standby battery life.
 - App Standby: no more battery drain from seldom used apps; App Standby limits their impact on battery life so your charge lasts longer.
 - USB Type C support*: Quickly transfer power and data all through the same cable. Lightning fast charging gives you hours of power in just minutes

 
Privacy & Security
 
- On an Android Marshmallow device, apps designed for Android Marshmallow only ask for permission right when it’s needed. You can deny any permission and still continue to use the app.
 - Advanced controls to turn permissions on or off for all your installed apps.
 - Verified boot: when your Android device boots up, it will warn you if the firmware and Android operating system have been modified from the factory version.

Productivity

 - Improved typesetting and text rendering performance.

 - Text selection actions such as a new Translate option that lets you translate text from one language to another right on the spot. (Note: requires Google Translate app installed)
 - Save paper with duplex printing support.

 
System usability improvements
 
- App links: enables installed apps to automatically handle their web URLs so you can jump right into the app, rather than the mobile web site, as appropriate.
 - Easily toggle and configure Do Not Disturb from quick settings.
 - If someone calls you twice within 15 minutes, you can choose to allow the call to ring through while Do Not Disturb is enabled.
 - Use automatic rules to enable Do Not Disturb for as many custom time blocks as you like or around events on your calendar.
 - Simplified volume controls allow you to manage notification, music, and alarm volumes easily from anywhere with the touch of your volume keys.
 - Streamlined Settings let you manage an app’s settings all in one place, from battery and memory usage, to notifications and permissions controls.
 - Google Now Launcher app list refreshed with search, fast alphabetic scrolling, and predictive App Suggestions.

 
Connectivity
 
- More power efficient Bluetooth Low Energy (“BLE”) scanning for nearby beacons and your accessories.
 - Hotspot 2.0: Connect to compatible Wi-Fi networks seamlessly and securely.
 - Bluetooth SAP: Make calls from your carphone using your phone’s SIM.
 - Portable Wi-Fi hotspot now supports 5GHz frequency bands.

 
Expandable storage
 
- Flex Storage: makes using SD cards or external storage devices as encrypted expanded storage for your apps and games on Android Marshmallow a whole lot easier.

 
Device setup and migration
 
- Easily transfer your accounts, apps and data to a new device.
 - During setup, you can add an additional personal or corporate email account (e.g., IMAP)
 - Auto backup for Apps: seamless app data backup and restore.
 - Backup/restore of additional system settings such as your Sync settings, preferred apps, Do Not Disturb settings, Accessibility settings and enabled IMEs.

 
Media

Internationalization
 
- Android is now available in 74+ languages with 6 new additions: Azerbaijani, Gujarati, Kazakh, Albanian, Urdu, and Uzbek.

 
Android for Work
 
- When receiving calls or viewing past messages, you can now see the full work contact details even if you’re not logged into your work profile.
 - Work status notification: A status bar briefcase icon now appears when you’re using an app from the work profile and if the device is unlocked directly to an app in the work profile, an alert is displayed notifying the user.
 - VPN apps are now visible in Settings > More > VPN. Additionally, the notifications that VPNs use are now specific to whether that VPN is configured for a work profile or the entire device.

 
Soon enough, we will be preparing some how to guides for this new version of Android. Please stay tuned with us for that.
