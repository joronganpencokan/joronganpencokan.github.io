# Unleash the Riches of Genshin Impact in 4 Simple Steps - Learn How to Mine Like a Pro!

Genshin Impact is a role-playing video game that has taken the world by storm. Millions of gamers are hooked to this game and are exploring the vast and visually stunning world of Teyvat. One of the essential activities in this game is mining. Mining can help you acquire valuable resources like ore, crystals, and minerals that can be used for crafting character ascension materials, weapon upgrades, and artifact upgrades.

The good news is that mining in Genshin Impact is easy and straightforward. With the right techniques and tips, you can mine like a pro and unleash the riches of Teyvat. In this article, we’ll share 4 simple steps to help you become a successful miner in Genshin Impact.

## 1. Get the Right Equipment

The first step to becoming a successful miner in Genshin Impact is to equip yourself with the right tools. The basic equipment needed for mining includes a pickaxe and a character with Geo element skills. The pickaxe can be obtained from blacksmiths in Mondstadt or Liyue. You can also purchase it for 50 Mora.

## 2. Choose the Right Location

The next step is to choose the right location for mining. Various regions in Teyvat have different types of resources. For instance, the Liyue region is known for its abundance of iron ore, crystal chunks, and white iron chunks. On the other hand, the Mondstadt region has more plants and wildlife. Choose a location that is rich in the resources you need.

## 3. Know the Mining Techniques

To maximize your mining efforts, you need to know the different mining techniques. Here are some tips to help you mine efficiently:

- Look for cracks in the walls, as they usually indicate the presence of ore.
- Use your Geo elemental skills to uncover hidden ore veins.
- Attack the ore veins to obtain the resources. The number of hits required depends on the type of ore.

## 4. Use Resin to Refresh Mining Nodes

Finally, if you want to mine more resources, you can use Resin to refresh mining nodes. Resin can be obtained by completing quests, opening chests, or exchanging Primogems. Using Resin will recharge mining nodes, allowing you to mine more resources.

In conclusion, mining in Genshin Impact is a simple yet rewarding activity. By following these 4 simple steps, you can unleash the riches of Teyvat and acquire valuable resources that can be used for crafting and upgrading your characters and weapons. So grab your pickaxe, choose your mining location, and start digging!

## Genshin Impact Mining Guide: How to Mine Easily

 
The first thing you should know is that you need to locate mining nodes. They are easy to spot in the story because they look like rocks and shine (as you can see above). Once you get near one such mining node, you need to use your elemental attack. Yes, basic attacks will not make a difference – elemental attacks will do the trick.

To know which button will execute the elemental attack, check the bottom right section of the screen. On the PS4, the button you have to press is R2 and the nodes will disintegrate right in front of you. Now all there’s left to be done is to collect the minerals you get like iron and crystal. Note that there is a recharge time for these attacks so you cannot use it back to back. But even one attack is good enough to get quite a few resource materials.
 
So, this is basically how to mine in Genshin Impact. The harvesting method is quite different than you would expect (without using a weapon or some other mining tool) so I hope this guide will clear your doubts.
