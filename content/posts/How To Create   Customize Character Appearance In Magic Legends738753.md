# Unleash Your Inner Wizard with This Mind-Blowing Guide to Customizing Magic Legends Characters!

Are you ready to wield the power of magic in your hands and become a true wizard in the realm of Magic Legends? The recently-launched free-to-play action RPG game from Perfect World Entertainment and Cryptic Studios lets you step into a world full of magic, monsters and epic battles. And what’s more, it allows you to create and customize your very own character, who can wield a variety of spells and abilities to defeat your enemies.

If you want to truly unleash your potential and stand out among the crowds of other players, then you need to master the art of character customization. In this guide, we’ll show you how to create a character that suits your play style, fits in with your preferred faction, and looks awesome to boot!

## Step One: Choose Your Class

There are five different classes to choose from in Magic Legends, each with their own unique set of abilities and play style. The Geomancer, for instance, is a master of earth magic with the ability to stomp the ground and deal crushing blows to enemies. The Mind Mage, by contrast, is a cunning and quick-footed character who can manipulate the thoughts of their enemies to render them helpless.

Consider your preferred play style when choosing your class - do you like to dish out damage from afar, or do you prefer up-close-and-personal combat? Do you like to play defensively or offensively? Once you have chosen your class, you can then choose your character's race, gender and faction-aligned skin.

## Step Two: Customizing Your Appearance

In Magic Legends, your character's appearance is almost as important as their skills and abilities. After all, who wants to be a powerful wizard if they look like a clown? Luckily, the game offers a wide range of options to ensure that your character looks the part.

From choosing hairstyles to facial hair, and from clothing to tattoos, you can customize almost every aspect of your character's appearance. Do you want a purple mohawk and a suit of leather armor, or do you prefer to look more traditional with a flowing robe and a staff? The choice is yours.

## Step Three: Abilities and Skills

Once you have your character's appearance sorted, it's time to focus on their abilities and skills. Magic Legends offers a vast array of spells and abilities to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

You can tailor your character's abilities to fit in with your preferred play style. For instance, if you prefer to play defensively, then you may want to focus on spells that create barriers or summon creatures to fight by your side. Alternatively, if you prefer to be a purely offensive character, then you might want to focus on spells that deal heavy damage from afar.

## Step Four: Weapons and Equipment

No wizard is complete without their trusty wand, staff or scepter. In Magic Legends, you can choose from a range of different magic weapons, each with their own unique properties.

In addition to your primary weapon, you can also equip different pieces of equipment that add special bonuses to your character's stats. Consider your play style when choosing your equipment - if you're a defensive player, for example, then you may want to choose equipment that increases your defense or healing abilities.

## Step Five: Join a Guild

Joining a guild in Magic Legends can provide a range of benefits, including access to exclusive quests, discounts on goods and services, and opportunities to team up with other players for co-op missions.

When choosing a guild, consider their play style and goals. Do you want to join a guild that's focused on PvP battles, or do you prefer one that's dedicated to questing and story missions? Do they have a website or Discord group that you can join to communicate with other members?

## Step Six: Have Fun!

Ultimately, the most important thing in Magic Legends is to have fun! Experiment with different spells, abilities, and play styles until you find the combination that works best for you. And don't forget to enjoy the vast, magical world of Magic Legends, complete with stunning visuals and immersive environments.

So, there you have it - our guide to customizing your Magic Legends character. With these tips, you'll be ready to unleash your inner wizard and take on the enemies that dare to stand in your way. Happy gaming!
