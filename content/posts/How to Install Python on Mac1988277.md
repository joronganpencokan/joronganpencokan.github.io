# Unleash the Power of Programming: Learn the Secrets to Installing Python on Your Mac Today!

Programming is a valuable skill that allows individuals to solve complex problems using technology. Python is a popular programming language that is used in a variety of industries, from web development to data analysis. If you're a Mac user, you can easily install Python on your computer and start coding today. In this article, we'll walk you through the process of installing Python on your Mac.

## What is Python?

Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language that was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use. Python is used for a variety of tasks, including web development, data analysis, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence. Python is also an excellent language for beginners who are just starting to learn programming.

## Installing Python on a Mac

Installing Python on a Mac is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Check if Python is already installed on your Mac.

Some versions of Mac OS X come with Python already installed. To check if Python is installed, open Terminal and type `python3` or `python`. If you see a message that says "Python 3.x.x" or "Python 2.x.x," then Python is already installed.

### 2. Download and install Homebrew.

Homebrew is a package manager for Mac that makes it easy to install software. To download and install Homebrew, open Terminal and run the following command:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### 3. Install Python using Homebrew.

Once you have Homebrew installed, run the following command in Terminal to install Python:

```
brew install python
```

This will install the latest version of Python on your Mac.

### 4. Verify that Python is installed.

To verify that Python is installed, open Terminal and type `python3` or `python`. You should see a message that says "Python 3.x.x" or "Python 2.x.x." This means that Python is installed and ready to use.

## Conclusion

Python is a powerful programming language that is used in a variety of industries. If you're a Mac user, installing Python is a simple process that can be done in just a few steps. Once you have Python installed, you can start coding and unleash the power of programming. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, learning Python is an excellent way to improve your skills and build your career. So what are you waiting for? Install Python on your Mac today and get started!

This article explains how to install the latest version of Python programming language onto a Mac using the most recent version of macOS.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- On Python website, select latest installer > follow prompts > Install or Customization.Confirm: Open Terminal > type python --version. Terminal shows Python version number if successful.

 
##   Installing Python on macOS  
 

The Python project makes regular releases of Python in standard .PKG format. Follow the following steps to install the standard Python distribution on your Mac:

 
- Grab the latest release from the Python website. Unless you're on an older machine and have to use a previous version of macOS for some reason, you can download the 64-bit installer file.
 - The download is the standard macOS .PKG format. Click the installer file to proceed.
 - The first screen provides some information on the install. Click Continue to move along.
 - Click Continue on the following page as well, which is a notice that the project will stop providing support for 32-bit installers from v3.8 onward.
 - The next screen asks you to accept the open-source license for Python. Click Continue and then click Agree.
 - Select a destination for the install on the following screen. You can click Install to place it on your main drive or click Customize to place it elsewhere.
 - Now the installer starts copying the files, and the progress bar tells you when it's complete.
 - Once the installation is finished, the app's folder opens in Finder.

 
##   Confirming Your Python Installation  
 

To quickly confirm your Python installation is working correctly, try the following command in Terminal:

 

Grab the latest release from the Python website. Unless you're on an older machine and have to use a previous version of macOS for some reason, you can download the 64-bit installer file.

 

The download is the standard macOS .PKG format. Click the installer file to proceed.

 

The first screen provides some information on the install. Click Continue to move along.

 

Click Continue on the following page as well, which is a notice that the project will stop providing support for 32-bit installers from v3.8 onward.

 

The next screen asks you to accept the open-source license for Python. Click Continue and then click Agree.

 

Select a destination for the install on the following screen. You can click Install to place it on your main drive or click Customize to place it elsewhere.

 

Now the installer starts copying the files, and the progress bar tells you when it's complete.

 

Once the installation is finished, the app's folder opens in Finder.

 

python --versionPython 3.7.4

 

If you want to further confirm things, try running a simple Python script. Enter (or paste) the following code into an empty text file and naming it "hello-world.py":

 

print ("Hello World!")

 

Now, at the command prompt, run the following:

 

python /path/to/hello-world.pyHello World!

 

If you get the above output, your up-to-date Python installation is ready to go.

 
##   Which Python Version to Install on macOS  
 

Python comes pre-installed on macOS, but the built-in version is specific to the version of macOS you're currently running. This means it's only updated when you receive an OS update from Apple. So, if you choose to use the version built into macOS, you may be running a version that's older than the current one.

 

Your other alternative is to install an up-to-date version directly from the Python project. Doing this comes with its own caveats, namely that you'll need to keep up with new releases on your own.

 

Before deciding this, consider the following:

 
- Will your Python programs be solely for your own use, on your own Mac? If so, the built-in version is probably sufficient.
 - Are you going to release your programs for use on a specific platform? When this is the case, it depends on how that platform tracks Python releases (or not). If you're targeting only macOS with your code, then the built-in version is actually a good choice, as you'll always know that the version you're using is the one that your users will have as well. However, if you're writing a web application, you'll need to consider what version of Python your web hosting company supports.
 - Some operating systems, such as Linux, will follow the most recent release of Python closely. In this instance you can also use more recent versions, in order to take advantage of newer features.
