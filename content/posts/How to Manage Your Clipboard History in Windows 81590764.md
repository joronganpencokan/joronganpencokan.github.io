As computers have become an essential part of our daily lives, we require more convenient and efficient ways to manage our tasks. One such aspect is the clipboard history, which allows us to store multiple copied items and access them whenever we want. In Windows 8, the clipboard history feature has been significantly improved, making the copy-paste process more straightforward and quick. In this article, we'll show you how to unleash the power of Windows 8 clipboard history and manage it like a pro.

Getting Started with Windows 8 Clipboard History

The clipboard history was first introduced in Windows 10, but Windows 8 also has a similar feature, though it is manual. Each time you copy content, Windows 8 will replace the previously copied item with the new one. However, if you want to save multiple items, you need to activate the clipboard history feature. Here's how to do it:

1. Press the Windows key + V: This will bring up the clipboard history window, which will be empty at first.

2. Click on the "Turn on" button: You'll see a message that says, "Windows can collect items from your clipboard to show in the history. Turn it on?" Click on "Turn on" to activate the feature.

3. Start copying items: Once the feature is activated, start copying content, and each time you copy a new item, it will be added to the clipboard history list.

Managing Your Windows 8 Clipboard History Like a Pro

Now that you have activated the clipboard history feature, it's time to learn how to manage it like a pro. Here are some tips to help you get started:

1. Pin Frequently Used Items: If you frequently use particular items, you can pin them to the clipboard history window. This will make them easily accessible, and you won't have to search for them every time. To pin an item, hover over it and click on the pin icon.

2. Clear Items You No Longer Need: If you have items in the clipboard history that you no longer need, you can remove them. To do this, hover over the item and click on the "X" icon that appears. You can also clear the entire clipboard history by clicking on "Clear all" at the top.

3. Sync Your Clipboard History Across Devices: If you have multiple Windows devices, you can use the clipboard history feature across them. To do this, go to Settings > System > Clipboard, and enable the "Sync across devices" option.

4. Customize Your Clipboard History Settings: Windows 8 offers several customization options for the clipboard history feature. To access them, go to Settings > System > Clipboard. Here, you can change the maximum number of items that can be stored in the clipboard history, enable or disable the feature, and more.

Conclusion

The clipboard history feature in Windows 8 is a powerful tool that can make your copy-paste process faster and more efficient. By following the tips mentioned in this article, you can manage your clipboard history like a pro and make the most of this feature. So, go ahead and unleash the power of Windows 8 clipboard history!

How many times have you copied something to the clipboard on your computer, just to lose it after copying something else? You then have to go back and try to find whatever it was that you had copied before that. This can often turn into a painful, time-consuming process.
 
If you do a lot of copying and pasting on your Windows PC, a clipboard manager is sure to come in handy for you. With a free clipboard manager like Shapeshifter, you can save more than just the last item that you’ve copied to your clipboard. Plus, it’s sure to give you a productivity boost since you’ll spend less time copying the same things over and over again.
 
Shapeshifter is a user-friendly clipboard manager that integrates nicely into Windows 8. Best of all, you won’t have to learn anything new; Shapeshifter works with Windows’s existing copy and paste keyboard shortcuts (CTRL+C and CTRL+V). As you’ll soon learn, Shapeshifter is essentially an extension to the Windows clipboard.
 
Here’s how to manage your clipboard history in Windows 8 using Shapeshifter.
 
## Getting Started
 
1. Download Shapeshifter for free; It will work in Windows 8, Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7.
 
2. Once you install the program, it will automatically open on your computer and you’ll need to choose the “interaction mode” that best suits you.
 
3. As far as interaction modes, you can choose between mixed mode, integrated mode, or external mode.
 
- Mixed mode – gives you the best of both worlds and combines integrated mode and external mode.
 - Integrated mode – allows you to paste and manage your clipboard items using CTRL+V.
 - External mode – allows you to manage items by clicking the Shapeshifter icon in the taskbar.

 

 
4. Once you select your desired mode, the Settings window will pop-up so that you can customize Shapeshifter as needed. You can change the language, colors, startup settings, and interaction settings.
 
Once you close the settings window, you can access it whenever you’d like by right clicking on Shapeshifter’s icon in the notifications area.
 
## Copying and Pasting Content
 
5. Now you can work on your computer as you usually would. Just to see how Shapeshifter works, you’ll probably want to copy at least two items in a row – you can copy text and images.
 
6. After you’ve copied two or more items, try pasting them into a textarea or textbox by using the keyboard shortcut.
 
Instead of simply pressing CTRL+V to paste an item, hold down the CTRL+V combo to bring up your clipboard contents. Don’t let go of the keys until you’re on the item that you want to paste.
 
7. You can then use the arrows on your keyboard to cycle through the items and select the item that you want to paste.
 
8. If you’re using Windows 7 or Windows 8, you can also use Shapeshifter’s icon in the taskbar to look through, select, and remove items from your clipboard history.
 
Just click on the item to paste it, and click on the “x” in the top right corner of an item to remove it from your clipboard history.
 
That’s it. Now you won’t lose your copied content anymore, instead it will be saved using Shapeshifter. It’s definitely a more efficient way of managing your clipboard history.
