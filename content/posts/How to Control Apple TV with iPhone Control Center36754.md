Open Settings.

 

Tap Control Center.

 

Select Customize Controls.

 

In the More Controls section, tap the + icon next to Apple TV Remote.

 

The Remote app appears in Control Center when you access it by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.

 
- Make sure your iPhone or iPad and Apple TV are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
 - Turn on your Apple TV (and HDTV, if the two aren't connected).

##   How to Control Your Apple TV Using Control Center  
 

Now that your iPhone or iPad and Apple TV can communicate with each other, you can use the phone as a remote. A virtual remote control that looks similar to the one that comes with the Apple TV appears on the screen.

 

Make sure your iPhone or iPad and Apple TV are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

 

Turn on your Apple TV (and HDTV, if the two aren't connected).

 

Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open Control Center.

 
On the iPad or iPhone X and newer, swipe down from the upper-right corner.
 

Tap Remote.

 

Select the list at the top and choose the Apple TV you want to control.

 
For most people, only one will show up here, but if you have more than one Apple TV, you'll need to choose.
 

On your TV, the Apple TV displays a passcode to connect the remote. Enter the passcode from the TV into your iPhone or iPad.

 

The iPhone or iPad and Apple TV will connect and you can use the remote in Control Center.

 

Here's what each of the buttons on the virtual remote control does:

 
- Control Pad: The space at the top controls what you select on the Apple TV screen. Swipe left and right, or up and down, to move onscreen menus and options. Tap that space to choose options.
 - Back 10 Seconds: The round button with the curved arrow facing left jumps back 10 seconds in audio and video that's playing onscreen.
 - Forward 10 Seconds: The button with the curved arrow facing right skips ahead 10 seconds in audio and video.
 - Menu: The Menu button works differently in different contexts. Generally, it works like a Back button.
 - Play/Pause: The Play/Pause button plays audio and video, or pauses it.
 - Home: The button that looks like a TV displays the home screen on your Apple TV (or, depending on the settings on your Apple TV, may open the preinstalled TV app).
 - Siri: The button shaped like a microphone activates Siri on the Apple TV to let you do voice searches. Tap and hold it, then speak into your iPhone.
 - Search: The magnifying glass button doesn't have a counterpart on the physical Apple TV remote. It opens a search screen where you can look for movies and TV shows in the Apple TV app.

 

Volume is the only feature available on the hardware Apple TV remote that isn't present in the Remote in Control Center. To raise or lower the volume on your TV, you'll have to use the hardware remote.

 
##   Why Use the iPhone Control Center for Apple TV?  
 

The remote control that comes with the Apple TV can be a bit difficult to use. Because it's symmetrical, it's easy to pick it up the wrong way or to press the wrong button. It's also small, so it's easy to misplace. If you have an iPhone or iPad, you can get most of the same control options without using the remote or installing an app by using a feature built into Control Center.

 
##   How to Shut Down and Restart the Apple TV Using Control Center  
 

Just like with the hardware remote, you can use the Control Center Remote feature to shut down or restart the Apple TV.

 
- Shut Down: With the Remote feature open in Control Center, tap and hold the Home button until a menu appears on the Apple TV screen. Use the Control Pad to select Sleep, then tap the Control Pad to shut the TV down.Force Restart: If the Apple TV is locked up and needs a force restart, tap and hold both the Menu and Home buttons on the Control Center Remote. Hold the buttons until the TV screen goes dark. When the light on the front of the Apple TV flashes, release the buttons to restart the TV.

 
In addition to all the great ways that Control Center lets you manage your devices, you can also customize Control Center in iOS 11.
