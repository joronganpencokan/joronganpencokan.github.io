# Revamp Your Desktop! Learn How to Move the Clock to the Right Corner on Your Windows 10 Taskbar in Seconds!

Are you tired of the default placement of the clock on your Windows 10 taskbar? Do you want to move it to the right corner for better visibility or just to give your desktop a little revamp? You're in luck! In this article, you'll learn how to move the clock to the right corner in seconds.

## Step 1: Right-click on the taskbar

First, you need to right-click on the taskbar. This will bring up a menu with different options. You'll want to select "Taskbar settings" from this menu.

## Step 2: Navigate to "Taskbar settings"

Once you've clicked on "Taskbar settings", you'll be taken to the settings menu for your taskbar. This is where you can customize the look and behavior of your taskbar. You'll want to scroll down until you see the "Notification area" section. Click on "Turn system icons on or off" in this section.

## Step 4: Turn on the clock in the right corner

Now that you've turned off the clock, you need to turn it back on again. This time, however, you'll be turning it on in the right corner of your taskbar. To do this, scroll back up to the top of the "Taskbar settings" menu and find the "Taskbar" section. Under this section, you'll see an option called "Corner icons". Click on this option and select "Right" from the drop-down menu.

If you ever want to move the clock back to the default position on the left side of your taskbar, just follow the same steps but select "Left" in the "Corner icons" option instead.

In Windows 10 the action center is one of the most useful features that lets you see and manage all the notifications in a central place. To make it more prominent, Microsoft moved the Action Center icon to the right-most side of the Taskbar. This placement makes it much easier to access the Action Center by clicking on other icons. However, not counting the ever-so-slim “Show Desktop” icon, the right-most corner of the taskbar is traditionally occupied by the Clock. So, if don’t like the new Action Center icon placement or if you just want to have your clock in its original place, here is how to move the Windows 10 clock to the right-most side of the taskbar.
 
There are two different ways to move the clock in the taskbar. The first one is to remove the Action Center icon from the taskbar, and the second is to use a free third-party software that swaps the positions of the Clock and the Action Center icon. Follow the one that suits your needs.
 
## Remove Action Center Icon Completely
 
If you are not using the Action Center and don’t mind removing it from the Taskbar, then you can move the clock to the right-most side of the taskbar with just a few clicks. To do that, click on the Action Center icon and then select the option “All Settings.”
 

 
The above action will open the Windows 10 Settings app. Here, select the option “Personalization.”
 
Now, select “Taskbar” on the left panel, scroll down on the right panel and click on the link “Turn System Icons On or Off.”
 
Here you will see all the system icons that are able to appear on the taskbar. Simply scroll down and toggle the button next to “Action Center.”
 
This action will immediately remove the Action Center icon from the taskbar, and the clock will be moved to the right-most corner. If you ever want to revert back, toggle the button again, and it will show the Action Center icon as usual.
 
## Swap Action Center and Clock Placements
 
If you don’t want to lose the Action Center icon, then you can use a free and open source software called Clock Position Righteousifier. Download the software from GitHub and extract it.
 
Now, navigate to the “binaries” folder, and then open the folder depending on your system architecture. In my case I’m opening the 64-bit (CPR_X64) folder.
 
Since this app tries to change the system settings, Windows tries to block it with a warning message due to security reasons. So before proceeding, you need to unblock the software. To do that, right-click on the EXE file, and then select “Properties.”
 
In the properties window select the checkbox next to “Unblock,” and then click on the “OK” button to save the changes. With this you are explicitly telling Windows to run the file when executed without blocking or showing warning messages.
 
The same is applicable to the DLL file in the folder. Right-click on it and select the option “Properties.” Now, select the “Unblock” checkbox and save the changes.
 
Once you are done with this, double-click on the EXE file. As soon as you double-click, the Action Center and the Clock will swap their positions. If you double-click on it again, they will revert back to their original positions.
 
As good as it is, the changes are temporary, i.e., when you restart your system, the Action Center icon and the Clock will be in their original positions. To avoid this, it’s better that you create a scheduled task that automatically executes the Clock Position Righteousifier application whenever you start your system. That way you don’t have to manually swap the positions each and every time.
