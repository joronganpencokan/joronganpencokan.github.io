Is Your Wireless Router Putting You at Risk? Learn How to Secure it Now!

Wireless routers have become an essential part of our lives. They provide us with the ability to connect to the internet from anywhere in our home or office. While this convenience is great, it comes at a cost- it puts us at risk of cyber attacks. A poorly secured wireless router can be an open invitation for hackers to access all the devices in the network. In this article, we will look at how wireless routers can put us at risk, the consequences of a security breach, and steps we can take to secure our routers.

Wireless routers are the gateway to the internet, and all the devices connected to them are vulnerable to attacks. Hackers can use various techniques to gain access to the router and steal sensitive information. One of the most common methods is through weak passwords. If the router's default password is not changed or if the password is easy to guess, hackers can access the network with ease. Another technique is through exploiting vulnerabilities in the router's firmware. Manufacturers release updates to patch vulnerabilities, but if the router is not updated, it can be targeted easily.

The consequences of a security breach can be severe. Personal information, such as financial data, login credentials, and sensitive documents, can be compromised. Hackers can also use the compromised router to launch attacks on other devices. This can result in a loss of data, downtime, and financial losses. Cyber attacks can be costly, both in terms of time and money.

Securing wireless routers should be a top priority to ensure maximum protection from cyber attacks. Here are some tips to secure your router:

1. Change the default login credentials: The router comes with a default username and password. Change those credentials to something unique and strong.

2. Use WPA3 encryption: WPA3 is the latest encryption protocol that provides stronger security than WPA2. Make sure your router supports it, and enable it.

3. Update firmware regularly: Keep your router's firmware up to date to patch vulnerabilities and improve security.

4. Disable remote management: Disable remote management unless it's required. This will prevent unauthorized access to the router from outside the network.

5. Use a Guest network: Create a separate guest network for visitors. This will prevent visitors from accessing your primary network and its devices.

In conclusion, wireless routers can be a threat to our security if they are not secured properly. As the number of cyber attacks continues to rise, securing our routers should be a top priority. By following the above tips, we can ensure maximum protection from cyber attacks, and minimize the chances of a security breach. Remember, prevention is better than cure!

Although wireless routers are a blessing for Internet users, they create a plethora of risks if they are left unlocked. In addition to having a slower connection, individuals with malicious intentions can easily gain access to your network when it is not secured.
 
In order to ensure you are safeguarding your computer and Internet activity from unwanted guests, it is necessary to use the following tips to lock down your insecure wireless router sooner rather than later.
 
## Set Your Approved Devices List
 

 
An easy way to boost security of your wireless router is to establish (and maintain) a list of devices that are allowed to access your network. Your mobile phone, tablet, and laptop have unique MAC addresses that can be used to allow access, even when the password is not known. Devices that are not on the approved list will not be able to gain access to your network, even if they have uncovered the password. This helps secure your network from unwanted guests.
 
## Encrypt your Password
 
Even novice Internet users know that password encryption is a smart move if you want to keep your connection safe and secure. In order to encrypt the password connected to your wireless router, you need to set the wireless security to WPA2 under the settings prompt. This allows you to establish a stronger password that utilizes a random combination of letters, characters and numbers that is far more difficult for intruders to dismantle.
 
## Disable Guest Networks
 
It is common for wireless routers to come with an additional wireless network intact, known as a guest network. This additional network allows users the ability to share an Internet connection with other users without needing to provide the password for the main network or access to shared files on your personal connection. Although this may be of benefit to a business who offers wireless Internet to its customers, it is not necessarily a perk for home users. In an effort to keep your wireless router secure, it is beneficial to disable the guest network when you install your router.
 
## Turn off Broadcasting
 
For the majority of wireless routers available on the market today, users have the ability to turn off broadcasting to unauthorized users. For example, when connecting a device to the Internet through your wireless router, you typically see a number of SSIDs, names, or wireless connections listed under the available networks. Although it is helpful for you to know the name of your own personal connection, it is beneficial to turn off broadcasting to surrounding Internet users so that they are not able to view your connection in that listing. Under your router settings, simply deselect “Enable SSID Broadcast” to turn it off.
 
## Conclusion
 
Although this list is not exhaustive, it does provide a starting point to ensuring your wireless router is safe and secure. To keep hackers and other intruders at bay, make sure to disable broadcasting, turn off access to your guest network if it is not necessary, establish a list of approved devices and keep it current, and consider encrypting your password.
