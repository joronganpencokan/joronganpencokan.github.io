## What is VPN?

VPN stands for Virtual Private Network – a network technology that enables users to securely connect their devices to the internet through an encrypted tunnel. VPN ensures that all online activity and communication between the user's device and the internet remains private and secure.

VPN providers offer different servers located in various countries worldwide. By connecting to a VPN server of your choice, you can easily disguise your true location and access content that would otherwise be restricted or unavailable in your location.

## Why should you use VPN?

There are several reasons why you should consider using VPN on your mobile device. Here are a few benefits:

### Anonymity

VPN allows you to browse anonymously as your actual IP address is hidden.

### Privacy

You get end-to-end encryption that protects your online activities.

### Security

VPN provides added security that keeps you safe from hackers and other online threats.

### Accessibility

You can bypass geographical restrictions to access content not available in your country.

## How to Manually Connect to VPN in Android

One of the best things about a mobile app is that it turns complicated things into simple tasks on the phone. For almost every VPN app in the Google Play Store, it comes with a simple button where you can easily tap to connect to the VPN. For those who wanted private browsing, this is definitely one of the best ways to get connected to a VPN. However, there are times when you need to connect to a private VPN, and it doesn’t come with a mobile app. How can you manually connect to VPN in Android? Let’s check it out.

## Manually Connect to VPN in Android
 
1. Grab your phone and unlock it. Starting at your home screen, drag the notification bar downward.
 
2. Now, tap your “Settings” icon. Yours may not look exactly like mine, but most Settings apps are available from the notification tray – if you can’t find it, use your App Drawer instead.
 
3. Within settings, below “Wireless and networks,” select “More.”
 
4. Within this menu, you should see an option for directly connecting to a VPN. Most modern Android phones support this feature, so if you aren’t seeing it, chances are your device is outdated.
 
5. Here is where you enter all the relevant information about your VPN. If you have a home or work VPN (that is, a non-provider VPN), you should already have all the information on hand that’s necessary to connect. Once you’re done entering the relevant information, tap “Save.”
 
6. Back in the VPN screen, you should see the newly set-up VPN profile. Simply tap on it to connect. Once connected, it should show an icon in the notification bar informing you that you are connected to a VPN.
