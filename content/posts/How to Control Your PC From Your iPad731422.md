# Revolutionize Your Computing Experience: Master the Ultimate Hack to Control Your PC with Your iPad!

In today's digital age, technologies have evolved to the point that they enable us to perform astonishing feats that seemed impossible just a few years back. These advancements extend to the countless gadgets and devices that we use every day to enhance our experience, such as personal computers and tablets.

With the advent of various remote access tools, controlling our PCs with tablets like the iPad has become much easier, making it an excellent solution for those tired of using keyboard and mouse all day. In this article, we will show you how to revolutionize your computing experience by mastering the ultimate hack that allows you to control your PC with your iPad.

## The Ultimate Hack: Remote Access

In simple terms, remote access is just like logging into your computer from a different location, using another device. It enables you to control your PC like you were sitting right in front of it. Remote access is an incredibly useful tool that is especially beneficial when you're working from home or heading out of the office for a while.

There are many third-party tools on the market that enable you to control your PC from your iPad or any other device, but one of the most user-friendly and widely used applications is Microsoft's Remote Desktop.

## How to Control Your PC with Your iPad

To get started, here's what you need to do:

1. First, make sure you have a Windows PC and an iPad.
2. Then, download the Remote Desktop app from the App Store on your iPad.
3. Next, install the Remote Desktop app on your PC.
4. Once you have installed the app on both devices, launch it on your PC.
5. In the Remote Desktop app window click on the + button to add a new PC.
6. Enter all the necessary details such as PC name, username, and password.
7. Once you have added your PC in the app on your iPad, tap on the added connection to initiate the remote connection.
8. You can now control your PC from your iPad.

## Bonus Tip: Use an Apple Pencil

While the touch screen of the iPad is sufficient, using an Apple Pencil makes the experience even more convenient. The Pencil allows you to use your iPad as a digital notepad, which is perfect for taking notes or drawing diagrams while having direct access to the files and folders on your PC.

## Final Thoughts

So, if you're looking for a new and improved way to control your PC, then using your iPad as a remote access tool is an excellent solution. With the procedure above, you can control your Windows PC with your iPad seamlessly, which is incredibly useful, especially for those looking for a more relaxed desktop setup.

Parallels Access costs $19.99 a year, but if you plan to control your PC from an iPad on a regular basis, the cost is worth it. You can sign in to your PC remotely using a 4G connection or a remote Wi-Fi.

 

Instead of taking control of the mouse, Parallels Access transforms your PC into what is essentially an app server. Your iPad launches apps through a special menu system, with each piece of software running in full-screen mode on your iPad.

 

You can interact with the apps, much like they were an app. This interaction includes tapping menus and buttons with your finger to activate apps without dragging the mouse pointer over to the apps.

 

Follow these steps to control your computer with an iPad using Parallels Access:

 
- Go to the Parallels website and register an account.
 - You need to register for an account to use the product once downloaded.
 - Select Buy Now or Download Free Trial to download a version of the software for Mac or Windows.
 - After the download, select the downloaded file to install the software. Like most software, you are asked where to install the application and agree to the terms of service. After installing, launch the software for the first time and, when prompted, enter the email address and password you used to create your account.
