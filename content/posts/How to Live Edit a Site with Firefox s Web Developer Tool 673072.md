# Revolutionize Your Web Design Game: Discover the Secret to Live Editing Your Site with Firefox's Web Developer Tool!

Are you tired of hitting the refresh button every time you make a change to your website's design? Are you frustrated with the time it takes to create a visually stunning site that looks great across all devices? Well, it's time to revolutionize your web design game with Firefox's Web Developer Tool!

It's no secret that creating a website can be a labor-intensive task. From coding to asset creation, creating a site takes time and effort. And while tools like CSS preprocessors and frameworks have made coding more efficient, the design process can still be a challenge.

That's where Firefox's Web Developer Tool comes in. This powerful tool allows you to live edit your website's design in real-time, without having to refresh the browser. This means you can see the effects of your changes instantly and save loads of time in the process.

To get started with live editing, you'll need to download the latest version of Firefox and install the Web Developer Tool add-on. Once installed, you can access the tool by clicking the wrench icon in the Firefox toolbar and selecting "Web Developer" from the menu.

From there, you'll be presented with a number of tools to help you optimize your website's design. One of the most useful is the "Inspector" tool, which allows you to easily identify specific elements on your site and make changes to their CSS properties.

To use the Inspector tool, simply click the "Inspector" button in the Web Developer toolbar and then click on the element you want to edit. This will bring up a panel showing the element's CSS properties, which you can then edit in real-time.

But live editing isn't just limited to the Inspector tool. With the Web Developer Tool, you can also live edit your HTML and JavaScript code. This means you can quickly test out new code snippets or make small tweaks to your site's behavior without having to switch back and forth between your code editor and browser.

Another powerful tool in the Web Developer Tool arsenal is the "Style Editor," which allows you to edit your site's CSS files directly in the browser. This means you can easily experiment with different styles or test out new layout options without having to make changes to your local files.

But perhaps the most exciting feature of the Web Developer Tool is its ability to create responsive designs. With the "Responsive Design Mode" tool, you can easily preview your site on different devices, such as phones or tablets, and make changes to your design accordingly.

All in all, Firefox's Web Developer Tool is a must-have for any web designer looking to streamline their workflow and create stunning designs faster. With its live editing capabilities, you'll be able to see your changes in real-time and make tweaks on the fly, saving you time and effort in the design process.

Would your site look better if the logo was moved five pixels to the right or had a blue background? Would adding a border or shadows to the images in your featured posts make them pop more? Modern browsers like Firefox come with Web Developer Tools that allow you to inspect a site’s inner workings and make live edits, watching the results in real-time.
 
In this tutorial you’ll learn how to make use of Firefox’s Web Developer Tools to live-edit any site. 
 
Note: This tutorial applies for most browsers, including Chrome, Opera and Safari.
 
## Meet the Web Developer Tools
 
Firefox’s Web Developer Tools is a comprehensive set of tools, from displaying all DOM elements to being able to measure its speed. For this tutorial you only need the “Inspector” and “Style Editor” tools.
 
Fire up Firefox and visit any/your site. From Firefox’s hamburger menu (on the top right by default), choose “Web Developer -> Style Editor” or press the Shift + F7 combination on your keyboard.
 
Firefox’s Web Developer panel will appear on one side of its window – usually at the bottom part. You can change its position by clicking on the three-dots button on the top right of the panel and choosing “Dock to Right/Left” or “Separate Window.”
 
Note: This tutorial is not showing you how to code HTML and CSS. You can learn the basics here.
 
## Inspecting the element
 
To be able to affect how an element looks, you have to be able to identify it. Click on the very first button on its toolbar or press Ctrl + Shift + C on your keyboard to enable the element-picker mode.
 
Move your mouse around the site to see different elements of the webpage highlighted. Next to them you will see their primary identifier hovering in a pop-up.
 
When you click on an element, it will be selected in the Inspector tab of the Developer Tools. 
 
When you find the element you wish to tweak, right-click on its entry in the Developer Tools Inspector and select from the pop-up window that appears – “Copy -> CSS Selector.”
 
## Start Your Live Edit
 
With your element’s CSS Selector copied to the clipboard, move back to the Style Editor tab in the Developer Tools window. Click on the “+” button on the top left to “Create and append a new stylesheet to the document.”
 
Paste your CSS Selector inside the new, blank stylesheet. Add a space, followed by a set of opening and closing curly brackets.
 
In CSS, an element’s looks is defined by first “targeting it” using an identifier like that CSS Selector, then adding some rules that affect its appearance, grouped inside curly brackets. Everything placed between the opening and closing curly brackets affects the “targeted element.”
 
For example, if you add the rule below:
 
This will hide from view the element where it is used. It is probably the easiest way to know that you’re targeting the correct element on your page. If it disappears, it was, indeed, the one you want, and you can delete this rule to try out others. If it didn’t disappear, it’s time to go back to the Inspector and select something different.
 
We won’t be showing you how to code CSS here, but you can play around with some of the popular rules like:
 
You will notice that the site’s element changes as you add rules to the CSS stylesheet. 
 
As a closing note, remember that nothing is saved. If you like how your tweaks look, copy your code somewhere – in a TXT file or your favorite note-taking application – so that you or a designer/developer will be able to add it to your sites’s stylesheet to make the changes permanent. If you need to learn about CSS, check out some online games to help you master the skill.
