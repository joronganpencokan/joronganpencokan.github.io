Halo is one of the most beloved video game franchises, and its latest installment, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, is no exception. However, PC gamers have been facing issues with the game's campaign mode, and these issues have left Halo fans furious.

The campaign mode of Halo: The Master Chief Collection has been causing crashes for PC gamers, making it almost impossible to progress in the game. The crashes occur at random intervals, and there doesn't seem to be any specific reason behind them. Players have reported crashed during cutscenes and at specific levels, which has left many feeling frustrated.

The issue has been plaguing players ever since the game's release on PC, and it seems like 343 industries, the developers behind the game, have been struggling to find a fix. However, there is a workaround that has been found by the community.

Halo Infinite Campaign is out and players can finally experience the Lore. While the Multiplayer was amazing, the Campaign mode is going to be better. But in all of this hype, the PC players are facing some problems. For some reason, Halo Infinite Campaign mode is not running on the PC Client. Sometimes it does not even Download correctly. But donâ€™t worry as this guide will help you out in fixing the Halo Infinite Campaign not working on PC Error.
 
## Halo Infinite Campaign Not Working On PC Error Fix
 

 
There are many reasons why Halo Infinite Campaign is not working on the PC Client. First of all, make sure you are downloading the game from the Xbox Game Pass. If you are downloading it from the Steam Client, you will run into the issue of getting the pre-order. So if you have gotten the game through the Xbox Game Pass, Download it from there. If you got Halo Infinite from Steam, uninstall it and reinstall it from the Xbox Game Pass. This should fix the Error.
 
While you are about to Download Halo Infinite, make sure you are getting the correct version. Select the Halo Infinite (Campaign) option as this will get you the base game and the Campaign mode. The other version will get you the base game and the Multiplayer mode, not the Campaign Mode. So check before downloading. The most important one, see if you have the correct Microsoft Account logged in to your Microsoft Store. The difference in accounts can lead to the rise of the Halo Infinite Campaign not working on PC error.
