Now the software giant has made available a OneNote importer that has been crafted to migrate Evernote notes into the service.
 
The tool is currently available on Windows, but the company will be releasing a version for Mac in the near future to allow users to migrate their notes to OneNote.
 
In this guide you’ll learn the easy steps to migrate notes from Evernote to OneNote using the importer.
