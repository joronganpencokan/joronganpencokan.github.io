On Windows 10, optional updates are those updates that are not critical to use the operating system, but they may be necessary for other functionalities. Usually, these updates can include packages for Microsoft and non-Microsoft products, feature updates, and third-party drivers (such as for printers, cameras, and network adapters).
 
In earlier releases, optional updates happen automatically, but starting with version 2004, May 2020 Update, the Settings app is getting a new section that allows you to view and decide which updates to install manually.
 
In this guide, you’ll learn the step to download and install optional updates on Windows 10.
