This article explains how to move your Apple Mail data to a new Mac or to a new clean install of the operating system. Information covers macOS Big Sur through OS X Lion.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Easiest way: Use the Apple Migration Assistant to copy everything from one Mac to another.Move manually: Copy Mail folder, Mail Preferences, and KeyChain from the current Mac to the new Mac. Open Mail on the new Mac.Make a backup of your Mail data before attempting a transfer.

 
##   Migration Assistant Is an Option to Consider  
 

You have options for performing the move. The easiest and most often suggested method is to use the Apple Migration Assistant. This method works well, but it has one drawback: Migration Assistant is an all-or-nothing process when it comes to moving data. It copies everything from one Mac to another. However, you may not be interested in transferring everything to your new Mac.

 
##   Move Mail Manually  
 

If you only want to move your mail, transfer three items from your current Mac to a new one:

 
- Mail FolderMail PreferencesKeyChain

 

After you transfer the files, launch Mail on your new Mac. All of your emails, accounts, and rules will work the way they did before the move.

 
##   Back Up Data Using Time Machine  
 

Before you move files around, make a current backup of your mail. You can use a built-in or third-party backup application for this. Time Machine is part of the Mac system and is easy to use.

 
Do a thorough backup and file clean-up before you make the transfer. Then, transfer your files over a network, burn them to a CD or DVD, or copy them to a USB flash drive. If the new system is on the same Mac, you can copy them from one partition to another.
 

To back up to an external hard drive with Time Machine, select Back Up Now from the Time Machine icon in the menu bar, or right-click Time Machine in the Dock and select Back Up Now.

 

If you don't have the Time Machine menu bar item, install it by opening System Preferences > Time Machine and placing a check mark next to Show Time Machine in the menu bar.

 
##   Prepare and Copy Your Keychain Data  
 

Apple Keychain is one of the three items you'll need to move to the new Mac.

 

With Keychain, Apple Mail operates without asking you to supply all your account passwords. If you only have one or two accounts in Mail, you can skip this step. If you have many Mail accounts, transferring Keychain makes using the new Mac easier.

 

Before you copy the Keychain files, it's a good idea to repair or verify the file to catch any possible errors. The method you use depends on your system version.

 
###   Verify the Integrity of the Keychain Files in OS X El Capitan or Later  
 

If you're using ​OS X El Capitan or later, the Keychain Access app is missing the first-aid feature. Instead, use the Disk Utility First Aid tool to verify and repair the startup drive that contains the Keychain files.

 
###   Repair the Keychain Files in OS X Yosemite and Earlier  
 

If you're using OS X Yosemite or earlier, the Keychain Access app includes a first-aid tool that you can use to verify and repair all your Keychain files.

 
- Launch Keychain Access, located in Applications > Utilities.
 - Select Keychain First Aid from the Keychain Access menu.
 - Enter the username and password for your user account.
 - Select Repair to verify the data and repair any problems. Click Start.
 - Close the Keychain First Aid window when the process is complete and quit Keychain Access.

 
###   Copy the Keychain Files to the New Location  
 

macOS stores Keychain files in your Library folder. As of OS X Lion, the Library folder is hidden so that you can't accidentally make changes to important system files.

 

Launch Keychain Access, located in Applications > Utilities.

 

Select Keychain First Aid from the Keychain Access menu.

 

Enter the username and password for your user account.

 

Select Repair to verify the data and repair any problems. Click Start.

 

Close the Keychain First Aid window when the process is complete and quit Keychain Access.

 

The hidden Library folder is easy to access, and you can make it permanently visible if you want.

 
- Open a Finder window by clicking the Finder icon in the Dock.
 - Go to your Home folder and select Library. Click the Keychains folder.
 - Copy the Keychains folder to the same location on your new Mac.

 
##   Clean Up and Copy Your Mail Folder  
 

Before you move your Apple Mail data, take some time to clean up your current Mail setup.

 

Open a Finder window by clicking the Finder icon in the Dock.

 

Go to your Home folder and select Library. Click the Keychains folder.

 

Copy the Keychains folder to the same location on your new Mac.

 
###   Apple Mail Cleanup  
 
- Launch Apple Mail by clicking the Mail icon in the Dock. Select an inbox.
 - Select Junk, and verify that all the messages in the folder are junk emails.
 - Each email account has its own Junk folder. If you have several providers, empty the Junk folder for each one.
 - Right-click each Junk folder and select Erase Junk Mail, followed by Erase.

 
###   Copy Your Mail Files  
 

The Mail files you need to copy are stored in the Library folder. This folder is hidden by default in macOS. If you haven't set the Library file to be visible previously, open it temporarily. From the desktop, hold down the Option key and choose Go in the menu bar. Select Library in the expanded menu.

 

Launch Apple Mail by clicking the Mail icon in the Dock. Select an inbox.

 

Select Junk, and verify that all the messages in the folder are junk emails.

 
Each email account has its own Junk folder. If you have several providers, empty the Junk folder for each one.
 

Right-click each Junk folder and select Erase Junk Mail, followed by Erase.

 

To copy your Mail files to a new Mac or system:

 
- Quit Mail if the application is running.
 - Open a Finder window.
 - In your Home folder, open the Library folder and locate the Mail folder.
 - Copy the Mail folder to the same location on your new Mac or in your new system.

 
##   Copy Your Mail Preferences  
 

The last thing you need to copy is your Mail preferences file:

 

Quit Mail if the application is running.

 

Open a Finder window.

 

In your Home folder, open the Library folder and locate the Mail folder.

 

Copy the Mail folder to the same location on your new Mac or in your new system.

 
- Quit Apple Mail if the application is running.
 - Open a Finder window.
 - Go to your Home folder and select Library > Preferences.
 - Copy com.apple.mail.plist to the same location on your new Mac or new system.
 - You might see files that seem similar, such as com.apple.mail.plist.lockfile. Don't copy them. The only file you need to copy is com.apple.mail.plist.
 - With all the necessary files copied to the new Mac or system, launch Apple Mail. Your emails will be in place, your Mail rules functioning, and all Mail accounts working.

 
##   Troubleshoot Keychain Issues  
 

Moving Keychains around can sometimes cause problems. However, they're easy to correct.

 

Quit Apple Mail if the application is running.

 

Go to your Home folder and select Library > Preferences.

 

Copy com.apple.mail.plist to the same location on your new Mac or new system.

 
You might see files that seem similar, such as com.apple.mail.plist.lockfile. Don't copy them. The only file you need to copy is com.apple.mail.plist.
 

With all the necessary files copied to the new Mac or system, launch Apple Mail. Your emails will be in place, your Mail rules functioning, and all Mail accounts working.

 

When you copy the Keychain file to its new location on your new Mac or system, the copy might fail with a warning that one or more Keychain files ​are in use. This can happen if you have used your new Mac or system, and in the process, it created its own Keychain files.

 

If you're using OS X Yosemite or later, you can use an alternative method of getting your new Mac or system to use your existing Keychain files. Instead of copying the files, make use of iCloud and its ability to sync Keychains between multiple Macs and iOS devices to achieve the same results.

 

If you're using OS X Mavericks or earlier, the process is a little more involved.

 
- Launch Keychain Access, located in Applications > Utilities on your new Mac or system.
 - Select Keychain List from the Edit menu.
 - Make a note of which Keychain files in the list have a check mark next to their names.
 - Uncheck any checked Keychain files.
 - Copy the Keychain files to your new Mac or system.
 - Reset the check marks in the Keychain list to the state you noted.

 
##   Troubleshoot Mail Issues  
 

Occasionally, you may run into a problem when you first launch Apple Mail on your new Mac or system. The error message usually says that Mail doesn't have permission to access a specific file.

 

Launch Keychain Access, located in Applications > Utilities on your new Mac or system.

 

Select Keychain List from the Edit menu.

 

Make a note of which Keychain files in the list have a check mark next to their names.

 

Uncheck any checked Keychain files.

 

Copy the Keychain files to your new Mac or system.

 

Reset the check marks in the Keychain list to the state you noted.

 

Make a note of which file is listed in the error message, and then do the following:

 
- Quit Mail if it's running on the new Mac or system.
 - Open a Finder window.
 - Go to the file mentioned in the error message.
 - Right-click the file and select Get Info.
 - Expand Sharing & Permissions. Your username should be listed as having read and write access, but you may see unknown.
 - Click the lock icon in the lower-right corner of the Get Info window.
 - Enter your administrator username and password, and select OK.
 - Select the plus sign (+).
 - Choose your account from the list of users and choose Select. The selected account is added to the Sharing & Permissions section.
 - Select the Privileges item for the account you added.
 - Choose Read & Write.
 - If there's an entry with the name unknown, select it and click the minus sign (-) to delete the entry and close the window.

 

That should correct the problem. If Mail reports a similar error with another file, add your username to every file in the Mail folder.

 

Quit Mail if it's running on the new Mac or system.

 

Go to the file mentioned in the error message.

 

Right-click the file and select Get Info.

 

Expand Sharing & Permissions. Your username should be listed as having read and write access, but you may see unknown.

 

Click the lock icon in the lower-right corner of the Get Info window.

 

Enter your administrator username and password, and select OK.

 

Select the plus sign (+).

 

Choose your account from the list of users and choose Select. The selected account is added to the Sharing & Permissions section.

 

Select the Privileges item for the account you added.

 

Choose Read & Write.

 

If there's an entry with the name unknown, select it and click the minus sign (-) to delete the entry and close the window.

 
##   Propagating Your Privileges  
 
- Right-click the Mail folder, located in your Library folder, and select Get Info.
 - Using the instructions in the previous section, add your username to the permissions list and set your permissions to Read & Write.
 - Select the gear icon at the bottom of the Get Info window.
 - Select Apply to enclosed items.
 - Close the window and try a rebuild.

 
##   How to Rebuild Apple Mail  
 

Rebuilding your mailboxes forces Mail to reindex each message and update the list to accurately reflect the items your Mac is storing. The message index and the actual messages can sometimes get out of sync, usually as the result of a Mail crash or an unintended shutdown. The rebuild process corrects any underlying issues with the program.

 

Right-click the Mail folder, located in your Library folder, and select Get Info.

 

Using the instructions in the previous section, add your username to the permissions list and set your permissions to Read & Write.

 

Select the gear icon at the bottom of the Get Info window.

 

Select Apply to enclosed items.

 

Close the window and try a rebuild.

 

If you use IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), the rebuilding process deletes any locally cached messages and attachments and then downloads fresh copies from the mail server. Rebuilding IMAP accounts can take quite a while; you may decide to forgo the rebuilding process for them.

 
- Select a mailbox by clicking its icon.
 - Select Rebuild from the Mailbox menu.
 - When the rebuilding is complete, repeat the process for any other mailboxes.

 

You can also try resetting user permissions if all else fails.

 

Select a mailbox by clicking its icon.

 

Select Rebuild from the Mailbox menu.

 

When the rebuilding is complete, repeat the process for any other mailboxes.

 
Don't be alarmed if messages in a mailbox seem to disappear during the rebuilding process. When the rebuilding is complete, reselecting the mailbox reveals all the stored messages.
 
##   Why Moving Apple Mail Makes Sense  
 

Starting over with Mail on a new Mac doesn't make sense. You probably have years of data stored on your Mac. While some of it may be fluff, other information is important enough to keep on hand.

 

It might be easy to re-create your mail accounts on a new system. Still, it's not easy to start fresh with none of your older emails available, your Mail rules gone, and Mail asking for passwords that you have long since forgotten.
