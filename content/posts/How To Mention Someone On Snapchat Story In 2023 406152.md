Snapchat has become a popular social media platform and with its unique features, it has managed to capture the attention of nearly 229 million daily active users. One of the exciting features of Snapchat is the ability to tag people on your story. However, this was not always the case because, in the past, Snapchat only allowed users to tag people using a sticker. But in 2023, that is no longer the case, as there is a revolutionary hack that now enables users to mention someone on their Snapchat story easily.

Gone are the days when tagging people on your Snapchat story meant going through the process of searching for the sticker and selecting it. Now, you can mention someone in just a few easy steps. Before delving into the steps involved, let's first see why this feature is so exciting.

With the ability to mention someone on your Snapchat story, you can connect with your audience on a deeper level. Whether you want to bring someone's attention to your story or let them know that they are part of your narrative, mentioning them is a sure way to make them feel included.

Now, let's look at how easy it is to mention someone on your Snapchat story in 2023.

Step 1: Open Snapchat and select the camera button in the middle of the screen.

Step 2: Take a picture or video that you want to post on your Snapchat story.

Step 3: Before posting the story, look for the option labeled "Mention" and click it.

Step 4: Type the name of the person you want to mention in the search bar.

Step 5: Select the person you want to mention from the list of suggestions.

Step 6: Hit the send button to finalize your snap, and the tag will appear as an overlay on your story.

As simple as that! You can now mention as many people as you want on your Snapchat story as long as they are connected with you on the platform.

However, there is one slight snag that users may face when trying to mention someone on their Snapchat story. The option to mention someone may only be available for those using the latest version of Snapchat. Therefore, it would be best to ensure that your app is continually updated to get access to all the latest features on the app.

In conclusion, tagging someone on your Snapchat story has taken a whole new level.
