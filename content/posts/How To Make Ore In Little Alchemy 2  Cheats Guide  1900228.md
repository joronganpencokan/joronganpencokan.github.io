Are you an avid Little Alchemy 2 player looking for some insider tips and tricks? Look no further – our Ultimate Cheats Guide is here to help you become an ore-making master in no time.

First, let's review the basics. Little Alchemy 2 is a puzzle game where you combine different elements to create new ones. For example, fire and water create steam, which can then be combined with air to make clouds.

But what about making ores? Here are some steps to follow:

1. Start with the earth element.
2. Combine earth with fire to create lava.
3. Combine lava with air to create stone.
4. Combine two stones to create a metal.

But the real key to becoming an effective ore-maker is experimenting with different combinations. Here are some additional tips:

- Don't be afraid to combine elements that seem unrelated. You never know what might happen!
- Keep track of your combinations in a notebook or spreadsheet. This will help you avoid repeating the same combinations over and over again.
- Use hints wisely. While hints can be helpful, they can also be expensive. Try to solve puzzles on your own as much as possible.

Now, let's get into some of our favorite cheats and tricks for Little Alchemy 2:

1. Combine "pressure" and "earth" to create "coal." This is a handy shortcut to creating a metal.
2. Combine "air" and "pressure" to create "wind." This is one of the elements needed to create a tornado.
