# Unlock The Secret To Doubling Your Snapchat Score With These Top 5 Proven Tips!

Snapchat is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world, boasting more than 300 million monthly active users. With over 10 billion video views per day, this app has become a part of our daily lives, and we just canâ€™t get enough of it. 

The Snapchat score is a feature that measures the number of snaps youâ€™ve sent and received. Itâ€™s a great way to keep track of your activity on the app and a fun way to compete with your friends. In this article, weâ€™ll share the top 5 proven tips to help you double your Snapchat score.

## 1. Send Snaps Regularly

The first and easiest tip to increase your Snapchat score is to send snaps regularly. The more snaps you send and receive, the higher your score will be. Send snaps to your friends as often as possible, and make sure to reply to their snaps. This will help to increase your engagement levels significantly.

## 2. Use Snapchat Streaks

Snapchat streaks are a great way to increase your score quickly. A streak is created when you and your friend snap each other every day for a specific period. The Snapchat streak will continue as long as both of you snap each other every day. 

Streaks are a fun way to keep yourself engaged with the app, and also a way to keep in touch with friends. Start a snap streak with your friends and watch your score rise. 

## 3. Get Creative with Filters and Lenses

Snapchat offers an extensive range of filters and lenses that can be used to create fun and unique snaps. Using these filters and lenses can make your snaps more exciting and engaging for your friends.

Experiment with different filters and add a creative twist to your snaps. Using filters and lenses can also help to increase your engagement levels, which in turn boosts your Snapchat score.

## 4. Post on Snapchat Stories

Snapchat stories are short videos or images that are posted for all your friends to see. Sharing a story on Snapchat is an excellent way to keep your friends engaged and increase your Snapchat score. 

Post on Snapchat stories regularly and keep your friends up to date with events in your life. This also opens up the possibility of your friends replying to your stories, thereby increasing your engagement levels and your Snapchat score.

## 5. Participate in Snapchat Challenges

Snapchat challenges are another great way to increase your Snapchat score. These challenges are usually posted by other users and can be anything from a dance challenge to a quiz. 

Participating in these challenges is a fun way to engage with the app and increase your score. Most challenges require you to send a snap to other users, which helps to increase your engagement levels.

In Conclusion

Snapchat is undoubtedly one of the most engaging social media platforms out there. By following these top 5 tips, you can double your Snapchat score and have more fun on the app. Remember to send snaps regularly, use Snapchat streaks, get creative with filters and lenses, post on Snapchat stories, and participate in Snapchat challenges. Have fun exploring the app and watch as your score grows before your eyes.

Unlike Facebook or Instagram, Snapchat doesnâ€™t show the number of followers or friends on a profile. But they do have a Snapchat score. According to Snapchat, snap score is determined based on the number of snaps you have sent/received and snaps posted to your stories. But there are a few other factors affecting snap score as well. In order to make your account stand out or have some sort of authority, you might want to show off a high score. Â After doing some tests, we came up with some best ways to increase Snapchat score.
 
## How to View Snap score?
 
To view your score follow the steps below.
 
- Open the Snapchat app and swipe down on the camera screen or tap on Bitmoji (if you use it) or the ghost icon (if you chose to remove your bitmoji) if you have linked one at the top left corner.

 
- Next to your username, you will see a number. It is nothing but your snap score.

 
To view someone elseâ€™s score you should have added each other as friends. If this condition is satisfied then proceed ahead.
 
- Swipe down on the camera screen and select My Friends.

 
- Tap on the desired friendâ€™s name. A pop-up will appear with their details. You can find their snap score next to their username.

So, now you got an idea what is snap score and how you can check it. Let us go ahead and look at the tips to increase it.
 
## Tips to Increase Snapchat Score
 
Before starting please note that by snaps I mean photos and videos. You wonâ€™t get any change in snap score for exchanging text messages. At least that is what I experienced.
 
### 1. Post Stories
 
For every snap, you publish to your stories you get a point. So, start sending out more photos and videos to your stories but keep it interesting. I have seen users posting blank snaps which isnâ€™t a good way to engage on social media just for getting points.
 
You wonâ€™t get any increase in snap score for opening and viewing your friendâ€™s stories.
 
### 2. Send Snaps
 
To get more snap score send more snaps to your friends in chats privately. For every sent Snap, a point is added. I even observed an increase in the score while sending the same snap to multiple friends. This means that the score is counted on per friend basis.
 
So, send that snap to as many friends as you possibly can to get more points out of the same photo or video.
 
### 3. Open Received Snaps
 
To increase the rate of snaps you receive you will have to engage more. You can achieve this by regularly replying to other friendâ€™s posts. This should get you more snaps from your friends in chats. But hereâ€™s the catch. Receiving them is not enough for the snap score to get a hike. You will have to open and view them.
 
For every opened snap you get a point. So, the next time you receive one donâ€™t forget to open it.
 
### 4. Bonus Tip to Increase Your Score Fast
 
As I mentioned earlier in method 2 that sending the same snap to multiple friends contributes to your snap score. It is not possible to create a large number of snaps of your happenings in a small amount of time. But you would need them to give your score a real push. Therefore you will have to create some useless snaps to send.
 
So, I would recommend you to add celebrities who have a huge following as you canâ€™t send meaningless snaps to your close friends consistently as doing this will throw them off and they might end up removing or even block you.
 
It is highly unlikely that celebrities will open your sent photos or videos. Which is why you can target them ðŸ˜›
 
Send a plethora of snaps using this method and see your score rising.
 
### 5. Send Snaps to Team Snapchat
 
Every now and then you can share some love with Team Snapchat contact. Send them snaps and you can even add a good number of points in one snap. It is also observed that when you become inactive on Snapchat for a while and then send a snap to Team Snapchat they give a good rise to your snap score.
 
Thatâ€™s all from my side. These were my findings after running a few tests and I am going to use a few tips to boost my Snapchat score. Which method are you going to use? Do you know any other hack to increase the score? Donâ€™t forget to share your thoughts in the comments below.
