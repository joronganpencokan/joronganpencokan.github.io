Tip #1 - Use Hot Corners

Hot corners are a smart feature in Windows 8 that allow you to easily access certain features by simply moving your mouse cursor to the corners of the screen.

The Charms bar is another essential feature in Windows 8 that you can customize to suit your needs. To access the Charms bar, move your mouse to the top-right corner of your screen.

The Windows key is one of the more underutilized features in Windows, but it can be a lifesaver if you learn how to use it. Pressing the Windows key will bring up the Start screen, which can be a great way to quickly access your apps and files. You can also use combinations of the Windows key and other keys to perform functions like opening the Task Manager, accessing Settings, or searching for files.

Keyboard shortcuts are a powerful way to navigate Windows 8 quickly and easily. Here are a few of our favorites:

In learning the basics of navigating Windows 8 with the mouse and keyboard (part 1), we looked at the new lock screen, the new “Start button” and how to use the Start screen; also how to switch through running apps, and the Charms to move around the new Windows 8 user interface. Continuing with Windows 8 navigation in part 2, I got many other navigation tips, so let’s get right to them:
 
## Launching Apps
 
To start an app, you just tap or click the live tile from the Windows 8 Start screen. As you do this, you’ll see the loading splash-screen, and as all Windows 8 apps are chromeless, the app will fill the screen. Quitting and going back to Start screen is simple too, just tap the , and you can also tap the WinKey again to return to the app.
 
## App Commands
 
To access properties of an individual tile, just right-click on it and the App Commands will appear. Depending on the app ability, you’ll be presented with different options such as Smaller or Lager, this will make either the tile a large rectangle or a small square. If you notice many tile will flash new content or images — this is what we now call “live tile” –, from the App Commands it is also possible to click Turn live tile off if this cause any distractions. Other options are the Uninstall or Unpin from Start.
 

 
With Windows 8 apps taking all the screen space, application’s menu are one thing of the past. To bring options and settings for a specific Metro style app, right-click from the current app and the App Commands will pop-up at the top and/or bottom.
 
## Snap View
 
In Windows 8 you can have two Metro style apps on the screen (or one Metro style and the Windows desktop environment) with the Split Screen functionality. One will be partly full-screen and the other one will use the slim version of the app.
 
Try this: Move the cursor to the top-left corner and bring the task switcher, click & drag one of the apps and drop it on the left or right side of the screen. If you want to switch and make slimmer app wider and vise versa, just drag and drop the divider to the left or right side of the screen.
 
## How to close a Windows 8 app
 
Windows 8 apps aren’t the same as the everyday applications that you’re so used to. These are specially designed to work in the same way as mobile phone apps works. Once you stop using them the get suspended, that way they don’t waste any of the system resources, which also means that you don’t have the need to close them. But in the case you do want to close one of them, you can use the Windows Task Manager (Ctrl+Alt+Del), or you can move the mouse cursor to the top edge of the screen, when you notice a little hand, make a left click, hold and pull down the app.
 
To view all the applications installed in your system, go to the Start screen, right-click an empty space and click All apps.
 
## Windows 8 Power User Menu
 
In some aspects Microsoft didn’t totally ditch the Start menu, now in Windows 8 you can right-click the left-bottom corner of the screen, and it will display a new contextual menu where you can get access to many common places in Windows such as: Desktop, Run, Search, Windows Explorer, Control Panel, Task Manager, Command Prompt; Computer and Disk management, Device Manager, System, Event Viewer, Power Options, Network Connections, and Programs and Features.
 
## Windows 8 new keyboard shortcuts
 
Windows 8 not only brings an easier to use GUI, but also tons of new keyboard shortcuts, that will help you to get task done faster. Check out Windows 8: Keyboard shortcuts and mouse tips and tricks to learn them all.
