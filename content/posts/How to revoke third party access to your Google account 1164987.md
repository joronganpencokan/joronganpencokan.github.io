# Are Strangers Sneaking Into Your Google Account? Here's The Ultimate Secret To Shutting Them Out!

With the rise of digital technology, we have become increasingly reliant on the internet for most of our professional, personal and entertainment needs. The internet has made our lives easier, but it also poses significant risks such as hacking and identity theft. One of the primary concerns for internet users is the possibility of strangers sneaking into your Google account. Unfortunately, this is not an uncommon scenario, and there have been several cases of Google accounts being hacked due to weak passwords and other vulnerabilities. 

If you are an active Google user, it is imperative that you take necessary steps to protect your information and keep intruders at bay. In this article, we will discuss some of the best ways to keep strangers out of your Google account by enhancing your account's security features.

## Step 1: Use a Strong and Unique Password

The first step towards securing your Google account is by creating a strong and unique password that cannot be easily guessed by hackers. Avoid using passwords that are too simple, such as your name or date of birth, and try to include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. It is also crucial to avoid using the same password for multiple accounts, as this will increase the risk of your other accounts getting hacked.

## Step 2: Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication is an additional layer of security that requires you to enter your password and a verification code that is usually sent to your mobile phone or email address. This feature adds an extra layer of security to your account and reduces the possibility of someone else gaining access to it, even if they manage to crack your password.

## Step 3: Check Recent Activity

Google allows you to monitor your account activity to see if anyone other than you has accessed your account. Check your recent activity log regularly, and if you see any unusual login attempts or suspicious activity, act immediately to change your password, review your account settings, and if necessary, contact Google support for further assistance.

## Step 4: Check App Permissions

Apps that require access to your Google account can potentially be used to gain unauthorized access or control over your account. Ensure that you review the list of connected apps and remove any apps that you do not recognize or trust.

## Step 5: Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN)

Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is an excellent way to protect your Google account from hackers, especially when accessing it from an insecure or public Wi-Fi network. VPNs protect your online activity by encrypting your traffic and masking your IP address, making it difficult for hackers to access your Google account.

In conclusion, with the ever-rising cases of cyber attacks and the increasing dependency on digital technology, it is essential to take necessary steps to secure your online activity. By following these simple steps, you can reduce the likelihood of strangers sneaking into your Google account and gain access to your sensitive information. Taking proactive measures and regularly reviewing and updating your security settings is crucial to maintain online safety and protect your digital privacy. Stay safe and be vigilant!

With a single sign-on service (SSO) like Google, for instance, all that you need to do is select ‘Sign in with Google’ and allow the service access to your account information. After which, you are signed-in to the service and can continue to use it. While, with the traditional way, you need to sign up using your email address and a password, which is also required every time you want to sign back in, SSO takes away the hassle and makes it easier to use a service without having to worry about remembering various username and password combinations.

 
### Types of Account access —


1. Basic – allows an app and service to access basic information of your account, such as name, email address, and profile picture (in some instances). 2. Read and Write – in addition to Basic access, which provides access to some information, Read and Write allows an app or service to create a copy of the information you provided and also edit or post content on your behalf. 3. Full access – provides an app or service complete access to your account information, which, in turn, grants the permission to view, edit, or even delete any information.
Similarly, when you decide to revoke access to your account, you normally see apps or services under two categories: Third-party apps with account access and Signing in with Google. As the name suggests, apps or services listed under Third-party apps with account access are the ones that have access to your account data (may include sensitive data in some instances). Whereas, the apps or services that are listed under Signing in with Google section use your Google account to sign you in and have access to only basic information, such as name, email address, and profile picture.
That said, let’s jump in and see how to revoke your Google account access from different services —

 
### Revoke Access using Web Browser


1. First, sign-in to your Google account, click on your profile avatar at the top-right corner, and select Manage your Google Account.
2. On the Google Account homepage, select Security from the options on the left.

3. Scroll down until you find a section that says Third-party apps with account access, and tap on Manage third-party access.
4. Here, you will see two sections: Third-party apps with account access and Signing in with Google. To revoke access from services listed under both these categories, tap on the service (you want to remove) and hit Remove Access.


 
### Revoke Access using Android Device


1. Open Settings and scroll down to find Google. 2. Under Services, select Account services.
 3. Now, select Connected apps to see a list of all the apps and devices with access to your Google account.

3. From here, tap on the app/service you want to revoke access to and hit the Disconnect button. You can also revoke access to a device in the same way.

Now that you have revoked access to your Google account, you will be logged out of these apps and services and will be required to grant them permission if and when you decide to use them again. Since your personal information is at stake when you grant permission to these apps and services, it is always advised to regularly keep a tab on what apps and services have access to your account data. And remove the ones that you no longer use.
