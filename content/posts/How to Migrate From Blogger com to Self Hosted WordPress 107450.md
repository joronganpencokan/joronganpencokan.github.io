Say Goodbye to Blogger Com with This Foolproof Guide to Hosting Your Own Website on WordPress!

Are you tired of using Blogger Com for your blog or website? Have you been limited by its features, design options, or customization? If so, it's time to say goodbye to Blogger Com and hello to WordPress. WordPress is a free, powerful, and open-source content management system (CMS) that offers endless possibilities to create and run your website or blog with ease. In this article, we'll provide you with a foolproof guide to hosting your own website on WordPress, so you can take full control of your online presence and unleash your creativity.

Step 1: Choose a Domain Name and Hosting Provider

The first step in hosting your own website on WordPress is to choose a domain name and hosting provider. Your domain name is the address people will type in their browsers to access your website, and your hosting provider is the company that stores your website files and makes it accessible on the internet. Some popular hosting providers for WordPress include Bluehost, SiteGround, and A2 Hosting. Before you choose a hosting provider, consider technical support, uptime guarantees, security measures, and pricing.

Step 2: Install WordPress

The next step is to install WordPress on your hosting account. Most hosting providers offer a one-click installation process for WordPress, so you don't have to be a tech genius to do it. Simply log in to your hosting account, navigate to your dashboard, and locate the WordPress icon. Click on it, and follow the prompts to install WordPress. Once the installation is complete, you'll receive a username and password to access your WordPress dashboard.

Step 3: Choose a Theme

WordPress offers thousands of free and premium themes that you can use to customize the look and feel of your website. To install a theme, go to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to Appearance -> Themes, and click Add New. From there, you can browse and search for themes based on your preferences, such as color scheme, layout, and style. Once you find a theme that you like, click Install and then Activate to make it live on your website.

Step 4: Create Pages and Posts

Now that you have installed WordPress and chosen a theme, you can start creating pages and posts. Pages are static content that don't change often, such as About, Contact, or Services. Posts, on the other hand, are dynamic content that you publish frequently, such as blog articles, news updates, or product reviews. To create a new page or post, go to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to Pages or Posts, and click Add New. From there, you can add text, images, videos, links, and other media to your content. You can also format your content using headings, bullets, or quotes to make it more readable and engaging.

Step 5: Install Plugins

Plugins are like apps that add extra functionality to your website beyond what WordPress offers out of the box. For example, you can install a plugin to optimize your website for search engines, create a contact form, add social media buttons, or protect your website from spam. To install a plugin, go to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to Plugins -> Add New, and search for the plugin you want. Once you find a plugin that suits your needs, click Install and then Activate to use it on your website.

Step 6: Publish Your Website

The final step in hosting your own website on WordPress is to publish it for the world to see. To do so, you need to configure your domain name to point to your hosting account, which varies depending on your hosting provider. Some hosting providers offer a domain name registration service, while others require you to transfer your domain name from another company. Once your domain name is connected to your hosting account, you can go to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to Settings -> General, and enter your website title, tagline, and other settings that you want. Finally, go to your website URL to see your website live on the internet.

In conclusion, hosting your own website on WordPress is a rewarding and empowering experience that allows you to showcase your skills, creativity, and passion to the world. By following this foolproof guide, you can easily migrate from Blogger Com to WordPress and take advantage of its endless possibilities. Whether you want to start a blog, a business website, or an online store, WordPress gives you the freedom and flexibility to make it happen. So, what are you waiting for? Say goodbye to Blogger Com and hello to WordPress today!

One of the first blogging platforms to hit the webosphere was Blogger in 1999. It was easy to set up and start posting right away. However, some time later, WordPress came into the scene, and it changed the way people saw blogging platforms. On top of the fact that it was easy to use, users also could personalize it with themes that they could further customize with CSS and HTML. Flash forward to 2010, self-hosted WordPress is usually the blogging platform of choice. What do  you do if you started with Blogger, but want to switch to a self-hosted WordPress blog? Here are the methods to migrate from Blogger to Self-Hosted WordPressm, quick and painless.

 
### 1. Find a domain and hosting provider
 
If you did not have your own domain, then you will need to find a domain provider. Find one that also has hosting plans (we recommend Hostgator), so you don’t have to look around for another service.
 
### 2. Setup the WordPress database
 
Create a new database for your WordPress. If you use a Macbook, then you can use this guide to install and test WordPress. If you need a more general guide, then check out the one the WordPress team put together. Some of the services actually have a way for you to press one button, and they will install WordPress for you. With the popularity of WordPress, many of them should be jumping on the bandwagon.
 
### 3. Export your blog out of Blogger
 
You always want to protect your blog, just in case something doesn’t go right. Therefore, I recommend exporting your Blogger blog, if something doesn’t go right. You do this by logging onto Blogger, and you go to your blog’s settings, you will see Basic tab. You will see the Export blog link.
 

 
When you click the link, you will be able to download your blog after pressing the Download Blog button.
 
### 4. Import your blog into your self-hosted WordPress
 
After exporting your Blogger blog, log into WordPress.  Click on Tools -> Import.  All the blogging platforms that can be imported into WordPress are shown. Click on the Blogger link.
 
Press the Authorize button to start importing your posts, comments, and users from Blogger into WordPress.
 
You will be taken to a Google window where you have to press the Grant Access button
 
You will see all your Blogger blogs. Select the one you want to import, and press the Import button.
 
After your Blogger posts and comments are imported into WordPress, you will be able to import the authors by pressing the Set Authors button.
 
You can map your Blogger name to your WordPress one.  If there is a new author, then there is an add users link that will allow you to create a user in WordPress that you can map to the new Blogger one.
 
Have you imported your Blogger blog into a self-hosted WordPress? How did it go for you?
