# 10 Surprising Ways to Fortify Your Apple Devices and Keep Hackers at Bay: You Won't Believe #7!

In today's Digital age, our everyday lives are incomplete without smartphones, laptops, and other electronic gadgets. It is impossible to imagine a world without the internet, social media, or online banking. However, these conveniences come with a price – a risk of data theft, identity theft, and cybercrime.

Apple devices are considered more secure than their counterparts due to their operating system's closed environment. Nevertheless, hackers are always lurking around to find loopholes in the system. Here are ten surprising ways to fortify your Apple devices and keep hackers at bay:

## 1. Update Regularly

Apple releases software updates that contain security patches to fix vulnerabilities found in the previous versions. It is essential to keep your devices updated regularly to stay protected from known security issues.

## 2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by asking for a second factor, such as a verification code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. It prevents unauthorized access to your account even if someone has your password.

## 3. Use Strong Passwords

Weak passwords that are easy to guess or reuse across multiple accounts can give hackers a way into all your accounts. Use strong passwords consisting of eight or more characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols and numbers, and avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.

## 4. Use a Password Manager

Using a password manager helps you generate and save complex passwords for all your accounts. It stores your passwords securely, and you only need to remember one master password to access all your saved passwords.

## 5. Enable Find My

Apple's Find My app is a valuable tool to help you locate your device if it's lost or stolen. It can also remotely lock, erase, or play a sound on your device to help you locate it. Ensure that it's turned on and set up before you need it.

## 6. Disable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi When Not in Use

Hackers can exploit flaws in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to gain access to your device. Disable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when you're not using them to prevent hackers from exploiting these flaws.

## 7. Use a VPN

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic, making it difficult for hackers to intercept or access the information you send and receive. It also protects your data from prying eyes while using public Wi-Fi.

## 8. Be Wary of Phishing Scams

Hackers can attempt to steal your login credentials or personal information by creating fake websites or emails that look legitimate. Always double-check the URL and email address before clicking on any links or entering any personal information.

## 9. Turn off Automatic Downloads

Hackers can exploit automatic downloads to install malware on your device. Turn off automatic downloads and only download apps and software from trusted sources like the Apple App Store.

## 10. Use a Firewall

A firewall adds another layer of protection against unauthorized access by blocking incoming and outgoing network traffic. Ensure that your firewall is enabled, especially when using public Wi-Fi.

In conclusion, protecting your Apple devices from hackers requires more than just setting a strong password. By following the ten surprising ways outlined above, you can fortify your devices' security and keep hackers at bay. Stay vigilant and keep your devices updated and secure.

The installation process could take anywhere from several minutes to over an hour depending on your internet speed.

 

If you haven’t updated your iPhone in a while and it’s an iPhone SE, iPhone 6S, or higher, you may receive an update prompt for a much newer operating system such as iOS 14. 7th generation iPod Touch devices are also compatible with iOS 14 and will likely receive this update as well.

 

iPad tablets that are newer than the iPad models listed above will receive a notification for an update to either iPadOS 13 or 14.

 
##   Is My iPhone Too Old to Update?  
 

The best thing to do if you’re unsure if your old iPhone can get a new update is to do an update check via the above process. If you know your iPhone’s model number, you can also see if it’s on the list of supported devices for iOS 13, iOS 14, and iOS 15.

 
##   Does Apple Update Older iPads?  
 

Apple does keep older models updated for several years. As of 2021, Apple was still updating some iPads from 2015.

 

Apple’s iPad Air, iPad mini 2, and iPad mini 3 iPad models can receive this new iOS 12.5.4 update. It’s unlikely that they’ll receive any major operating system updates in the future.

 

Older iPad models that came out before the iPad Air, iPad mini 2, and iPad mini 3 are no longer receiving updates while newer models will be eligible for updates to iPadOS 13, iPadOS 14, or iPadOS 15.

 
While some iPads may no longer get operating system updates, some apps can still update on older devices. Many features will also still work for years to come.
 
##   iOS 12.5.4: Why You Should Update Your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad  
 

Updating your device to iOS 12.5.4, if possible, is incredibly important as it fixes three main security flaws relating to memory corruption and management that could potentially allow other parties to remotely run commands and execute code.

 
The easiest way to check if an update is available for your iPad is to check via the update steps shown at the top of this page.
 

Even if you don’t connect to the internet that often, this new iOS update should still be installed, as your device may already be affected by these exploits.

 
##   What to Do if You Can't Update Your Apple Device  
 

If your Apple device doesn’t support the iOS 12.5.4 update and can’t be upgraded to another newer operating system, it’s important to understand that it currently lacks the higher level of security protection offered on newer iPhones, iPads, and iPod touch models.

 

The best strategy in this situation is to limit when you connect the device to the internet to when you need to update apps or download media files. This can be done by turning off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth or by turning on Airplane Mode.

 
If you have an old iPhone, talk to your carrier. They may be able to give you a newer model at a discount or even for free if you’ve been a customer for a while.
 
- How can I improve my iPhone security?
 - Some general ways to improve your iPhone security include setting up a passcode on your iPhone, making sure to use Face ID or Touch ID if your device supports it, and enabling Find My iPhone so you can track your device using its built-in GPS. Also, go to your iPhone Settings and select Privacy to set privacy levels for your installed apps. For enhanced security, consider setting set up VPN access on your iPhone either manually via Settings or with a VPN app.
 - How long does Apple give iPhones security updates?
 - Historically, Apple has done a good job keeping its older devices included with updates. For example, iOS 15 benefits the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, which originally shipped with iOS 9, meaning these models will see seven iOS versions. (These older devices won't be able to take advantage of all the new iOS 15 features, however). The iPhone 8, which shipped with iOS 11, sees its fifth iOS iteration with iOS 15. The iOS 12.5.4 update, described above, is another example of Apple keeping older devices in the update loop.
 - What is the Apple Security Alert?
 - The "Apple Security Alert" is a scam, and it has nothing to do with Apple. It's a fake pop-up alert Mac and iOS users may encounter after visiting a malicious website. It informs you that you've been hacked, your privacy is at risk, and says you should should call a specified Apple Support number immediately. This is a fake error message designed to trick unwitting users out of their money. To get rid of the "Apple Security Alert" try clearing your Safari browser history and data, opt to block pop-ups, and enable fraudulent website warnings.
