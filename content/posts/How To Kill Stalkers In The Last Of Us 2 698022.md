Title: You Won't Believe the Insane Tactics to Take Down Stalkers in The Last of Us 2!

The Last of Us Part 2 is a game that stands out for its gripping narrative, exceptional gameplay, and its ability to balance both. What makes the game even more exciting is the wide range of enemies players encounter throughout, including stalkers. Stalkers are stealthy and deadly, making them difficult to spot, making players’ hearts race with dread. Here, we will introduce some insane tactics to take down stalkers, helping players survive and triumph over these nefarious monsters.

First of all, players must remember that stalkers cannot be spotted with Listen Mode. Instead, using the dodge button can help outrun and avoid stalkers while also conserving ammo. Players can use dodge to get away from them, waiting for the right moment to strike. Once the stalker is in front of the player, the player can use a powerful punch to counter the stalker's attack, knocking them on the ground. The stalker can then be finished off with a couple of powerful hits or with a well-placed bullet.

Another technique players can use is to toss a brick or bottle to draw the stalker out of hiding. Once the stalker is in view, players can use a powerful weapon like a shotgun or a powerful melee weapon. Players should avoid using silenced weapons, such as bows and arrows, as they are too weak to stop a stalker.

Another strategy is to use the environment to the player's advantage. In some areas, there are traps that can be used to take down stalkers. Players should look out for traps like trip mines, which can be used to set up a nearly undetectable trap. Players can also use explosive arrows, which can cause a tremendous shockwave to damage the stalker.

Players should always remember that the stalkers are intelligent, and they will do anything to take down the player. Thus, players must constantly move around and close the distance between them and the stalker. If players can get close enough, they can use a powerful weapon to take them down efficiently.

Finally, players should always use stealth to their advantage. Stalkers are incredibly perceptive and can see through players' camouflage. However, by using stealth, players can get a jump on the stalkers, catching them by surprise, allowing the player to finish them off without confrontation.

In conclusion, The Last of Us Part 2 has provided players with a host of enemies to battle, each with its unique strengths and weaknesses. Stalkers may be difficult to defeat, but with the above tactics, players can confidently confront these deadly enemies with ease. By combining stealth, powerful weapons, and tactical advantage, players can take down these monsters and continue on the path of survival. So what are you waiting for? Step up and take down the stalker like the survivor you are!

The world of Last of Us 2 is packed with disgusting creatures lurking in the corners. Players have to always be alert because an infected monster can jump out of the shadows out of nowhere. Take the encounter with the Rat King Clicker boss for example. It will appear suddenly while Ellie is looking for some medical supplies. Similarly, the Stalkers hide in the shadows and attack you suddenly, catching you off guard. But there are some strategies you can use to either avoid or kill Stalkers. So, in this guide, we will explain how to beat Stalkers in The Last of Us Part 2.
 
## The Last of Us 2: Kill Stalkers Easily
 
Stalkers in The Last of Us 2 are more dangerous, careful and smart. The unfortunate part is that Stalkers will directly charge towards you once they spot you. But that’s not even the worst thing – even the Listen Mode is not good enough to spot them, so the pressure is even higher. So, without further ado, let’s see how to beat Stalkers.
 
Unlike the Rat King Clicker boss battle, where choosing melee attacks is a bad idea, it’s not such a bad idea in the case of Stalkers. When you have the chance, take them out with melee weapons but most often you will find yourself shooting them instead.
 
There are situations where you will face many of these infected enemies at the same time. During these moments, the strategy of melee weapons will not work. Hence, getting headshots using a shotgun is the best option to kill Stalkers at that time.
 
Also, sometimes, the best tactic is to bring them out of the shadows by creating a loud noise. You can use a brick for this. When they come out in groups, you can take them out using a bomb trap or with Molotovs.
 
While walking around near Stalkers, you have to keep an eye on all angles where they might be hiding. If you use a bomb trap well, you can kill them easily.
 
If you don’t want to get into a fight with the Stalkers, you can also throw a glass bottle towards a certain area and run in the opposite direction to escape. Keep moving with your back to the wall because these infected creatures are quite annoyingly sneaky.
 
So, this is how to kill Stalkers in The Last Of Us 2. If you want to know more such useful tips and tricks, check out our TLOU 2 Wiki guide.
