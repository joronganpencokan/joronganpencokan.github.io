The internet has significantly revolutionized how we communicate and share information with others. Thanks to social media apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and WhatsApp, we can now connect with friends, family members, and colleagues, regardless of their location.

However, as much as social media has made our lives more comfortable, it has also come with a significant cost- data charges! Most of us have at one point or the other, realized that we have to pay a considerable amount of money for using these apps excessively. With that said, today's article aims to teach you how to save big when using your social media apps.

1. Check for Free Wi-Fi Networks

Most public places like cafes, hotels, and restaurants offer free Wi-Fi services to customers. If you know you are going to use your social media apps excessively, it's advisable to look for such hotspots and connect to them instead of using your mobile data.

2. Keep Track of Your Data Usage

Knowing your data usage is critical to avoid overspending. Most mobile service providers provide customers with a data usage check option. Make sure you keep track of your data usage weekly or monthly to ensure you don't exceed your data bundle limit.

3. Turn Off Automatic Updates

One of the reasons why you can quickly exhaust your data bundles when using social media apps are automatic updates. Whenever you activate your data, your apps tend to update themselves automatically, eating into your data bundles. To avoid this, turn off automatic app updates and manually update your apps only when you have Wi-Fi connection enabled.

4. Use a Data Saving App

Many data-saving apps like Opera Mini and Datally can help you reduce your data consumption. These apps compress your data usage into smaller sizes, allowing you to use social media apps without using too much data.

5. Avoid Streaming Videos

Videos tend to consume a lot of data. If you know you have limited data bundles, it's best to avoid streaming videos, especially if it's not crucial. Alternatively, you can download the videos while connected to Wi-Fi and watch them later.

In conclusion, using social media apps doesn't have to come at a considerable cost. By following the tips mentioned above, you can learn how to save big on data charges when using social media apps. So the next time you log into your social media accounts, remember to follow these steps, and you'll be amazed at how much your data bundle lasts.
