Discover the Secret Technique to Create Custom Ringtones for Your iPhone with ZERO Cost!

If you're an iPhone user, you know how important it is to have a unique ringtone. It's not only a style statement but also helps you identify who is calling without looking at your phone. However, buying a ringtone from the iTunes store can be expensive, and you may not always find the perfect ringtone you're looking for.

The good news is that you can create custom ringtones for free! Yes, you read that right! Here's a secret technique to create custom ringtones for your iPhone without spending a single penny.

Step 1: Find the Song You Want to Use as a Ringtone

The first step is to find the song you want to use as your ringtone. Choose a song that has a catchy tune or a part of the song that you really like. It could be a few seconds or up to 30 seconds, which is the maximum length for a ringtone.

Step 2: Convert the Song to AAC format

To convert the song to the ringtone format, you'll need to change it to the .m4r file format. However, before doing that, you'll need to convert the song to AAC format. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Open iTunes and click on "Preferences."
2. Click on "Import Settings" and select "AAC Encoder."
3. Click "OK" to save the settings.
4. Select the song you want to use as a ringtone and right-click on it.
5. Click on "Create AAC Version."

iTunes will create a new version of the song in AAC format. The new file will have the same name as the original file, but it will be significantly smaller.

Step 3: Rename the AAC File to a .m4r File

Next, you'll need to rename the AAC file to a .m4r file. Here's how to do it:

1. Right-click on the AAC file and select "Show in Windows Explorer" or "Show in Finder" if you're on a Mac.
2. Change the file extension from .m4a to .m4r. When prompted, click "Continue" to confirm the change.

Step 4: Add the Ringtone to iTunes

The next step is to add the ringtone to iTunes. Follow these steps:

1. Open iTunes and click on "File."
2. Select "Add File to Library" or "Add Folder to Library," depending on where the ringtone is stored.
3. Choose the .m4r file you just created and click "Open."

The ringtone will now be added to iTunes and can be synced with your iPhone.

Step 5: Sync the Ringtone with Your iPhone

The final step is to sync the ringtone with your iPhone. Follow these steps:

1. Connect your iPhone to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Select your iPhone in iTunes.
3. Click on "Tones" in the left sidebar.
4. Check the box next to "Sync Tones."
5. Select "All tones" or "Selected tones," depending on the ringtone you want to sync.
6. Click "Apply" to sync the ringtone with your iPhone.

Conclusion

Creating custom ringtones for your iPhone has never been easier! With this secret technique, you can create ringtones that are unique and tailored to your personality, without spending any money. Follow these steps and enjoy your new custom ringtone!

The iPhone is an awesome smartphone and I’ve been in love with it ever since I got it.
 
The iTunes app store is just one of the many benefits of using the iPhone and it is amazing to see and use all the innovative applications being developed by third party developers.
 
However, if you talk about Apple as a company, they’ve had a pretty tight control over the iPhone platform and that is my only gripe with it. Apple’s control over the iPhone ecosystem is so much that they charge you to even create ring tones for the iPhone even if you have purchased the song legally through iTunes, and for a lot of people paying for ringtones is the only way to get ringtones for the otherwise excellent phone.
 
In today’s tutorial we’ll show you how you can create a ringtone for your iPhone for free using nothing but iTunes and a little perseverance.
 
To start with creating your own iPhone ringtone, open iTunes and select the song that you want to make a ringtone out of.
 
Right click and select “Get Info“. Go to the “Options” tab select a “Start Time” and “Stop Time” . This will ensure that iTunes will play the song starting from the “Start Time” to the “Stop Time”. Make sure that the stop time doesn’t exceed the start time by more than about 40 seconds. To be on the safer side, I usually keep the length at 30 seconds.
 
You can uncheck the start and stop time settings after you’ve created your ring tone.
 
Now, go to Edit->Preferences and in the General tab click on Import settings
 
And make sure that the AAC encoder settings are set to the following.
 
Now, right click on the song that you’d selected in the beginning and create an AAC version out of it.
 
You should now see two songs with the same name in iTunes but one of them would be of 30 seconds duration (or the duration that you chose for the ringtone), while the other one would be the full original song. We’re almost done now.
 
Select the newly created 30 second AAC version of the song in iTunes and press CTRL+C. Paste the song on your desktop (or any other folder) using the CTRL+V shortcut. This AAC version of the song will have the .M4A extension. Change it to .M4R.
 
Now, with the iPhone connected to your computer. Simply drag this file to the iPhone icon in iTunes.
 
That’s it. Your newly created ringtone should now be visible in the iPhone and you can start using it rightaway.
