# Unleash Your Inner Organizational Guru: Learn How To Make Gmail Labels in 5 Easy Steps!

Gmail is one of the most popular email platforms in the world. With its simple user interface and powerful features, it’s no wonder why so many people choose Gmail for their email needs. However, not everyone knows how to use all of Gmail’s features, particularly one of its most useful: labels.

Labels in Gmail are a simple but powerful way of organizing your emails. Labels allow you to categorize your emails and make them easier to find. With labels, you can quickly sort through your emails and find the ones you need without having to sift through hundreds of emails. In this article, we’ll show you how to make Gmail labels in 5 easy steps.

## Step 1: Open Gmail

The first step is to open your Gmail account. Once you’ve logged in, you should see your inbox. If you don’t, click on the inbox option at the top left corner of your screen.

## Step 2: Click on the Labels icon

Next, look for the Labels icon on the left-hand side of your screen. It should be located below your inbox and above your draft folder. Click on the Labels icon to open it.

## Step 3: Create a new label

In the Labels menu, you’ll see all of your current labels, if you have any. To create a new label, click on the Create new label button, which is located at the bottom of the Labels menu.

## Step 4: Name your new label

Once you’ve clicked on Create new label, a pop-up window will appear. In this window, you can name and customize your new label. Give your label a name that reflects its purpose. For example, if you’re creating a label for work-related emails, you might choose to name it “Work”.

You can also choose a color for your label by clicking on the small color box next to the label name. This can help you visually distinguish between different types of labels.

## Step 5: Apply your label

Once you’ve created and named your label, it’s time to apply it to your emails. To do this, simply select the emails you want to label by checking the boxes next to them. Then, click on the Label icon located at the top of the page.

You’ll see a list of your labels. Select the label you just created to apply it to your emails. You can also apply multiple labels to the same email if it falls into more than one category.

Congratulations! You’ve just learned how to make Gmail labels in 5 easy steps. With labels, you’ll be able to organize your emails like a pro and quickly find the emails you need. So go ahead and unleash your inner organizational guru - your inbox will thank you!

This article explains how to add, search for, and remove labels for Gmail messages. Gmail labels act as category subfolders so you can keep your email messages organized.

 
###

##   Gmail Label Making Instructions  
 

Gmail uses labels to organize mail. When you label an email in Gmail, you're telling Gmail to display the message in a specific folder-like section of your account.

 

Making your own Gmail label is very easy. You can do so while filtering messages or via the label option in Gmail's settings. However, below, we'll look at making a new label in Gmail the easiest way: from the email itself.

 
- Open a Gmail message and select the Labels icon.
 - Select Create new.
 - Enter a label name, then select Create.
 - To put the label within another label for better organization, you can enable Nest label under and choose another label.

 
##   Assigning a Label to Multiple Emails  
 

There are a few quick methods for labeling multiple emails at once.

 
You can also label a message you're currently writing by selecting the menu button in the lower right-hand corner of the message. Access the Label submenu to see the current labels and the option to make a new one.
 

Open a Gmail message and select the Labels icon.

 

Select Create new.

 

Enter a label name, then select Create.

 
To put the label within another label for better organization, you can enable Nest label under and choose another label.
 
###   Select the Messages  
 

One method for labeling multiple emails at once is to select each one by putting a check in the box off to the left. Then, select Labels in the menu at the top of Gmail, and check the boxes next to each label those messages to have. Or, use Create new to assign a new label to the emails.

 
###   Search for the Emails  
 

You can also use the Search function to pull up a list of messages you'd like to label. This is especially handy if you have a large number of emails that you want to collect under a specific label.

 

For example, you might search subject:order so that you can gather online orders into your own Online Purchases label. Then, with all of those emails listed, you can use the Select button on the left side of the menu to highlight all of them. Applying one or more labels is as easy as going through the Labels button.

 
##   How to Undo a Gmail Label  
 

Removing a label from an email is as simple as using the Label button to uncheck the label. Or, you can select the small x next to the label at the top of the email.

 
If you have a very large number of messages, not all of them will appear in the displayed list. To highlight all of them, click Select all conversations that match this search, displayed below the menu and above the emails.
 
##   How to Delete a Gmail Label  
 

It's good practice to delete unused and unneeded labels. Labels are a great organization tool, but having too many will clutter your left pane menu and can make Gmail run slowly.

 

To delete Gmail labels, open the Labels settings via the Gmail menu (Settings > See all Settings > Labels), and then select remove next to the labels.

 
Deleting a Gmail label won't delete the messages that were using it but it will delete the label itself, so you won't be able to assign emails that label unless you re-create it.
