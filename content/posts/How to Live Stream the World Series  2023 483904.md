##   How to Watch the World Series Live Stream  
 

There are two ways to watch a live stream of the world series:

 
### 
World Series Date, Time, and Channel
 
Game 1: TBD
 
- Postseason.tv: The official source for Major League Baseball live streams, which is only available during the postseason.
 - Live television streaming services: Any service like fuboTV or Sling TV that offers a live stream of the local Fox affiliate will also stream the World Series.

 
##   World Series Official Live Stream Provider  
 

Major League Baseball does not have an official live stream provider for postseason games, which includes the World Series. Official MLB World Series live streams are only available if you subscribe to both MLB.tv and a qualifying cable or satellite television provider.

 

This is referred to as a blackout, and it is due to contracts between Major League Baseball and the networks that pay to broadcast postseason games like the World Series:

 
###   Postseason Live Blackout  
 

Due to Major League Baseball exclusivities, during the MLB Postseason, all live games except for those games for which Authenticated Access is available will be blacked out in the United States (including the territories of Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Canada. If you are an MLB.TV Subscriber in an area subject to blackout each of these games will be available as an archived game approximately 90 minutes after the conclusion of the applicable game.

 
##   Stream the World Series Live on MLB.com (Qualifying Subscribers Only)  
 

Before you watch the official World Series live stream, make sure that you meet two important qualifications:

 
- You must subscribe to a qualifying television provider.You must subscribe to Major League Baseball's streaming service.

 

If you meet both of those requirements, you may be able to watch postseason games, like the World Series, through the official MLB source.

 - Log in to your MLB.com account.
 - Place your mouse over MLB.tv in the navigation bar.
 - Click on Watch MLB.tv.
 - Look for the TV icon beneath the game you are interested in, and click one of the links.

 
##   Watch the World Series Online With Fox Sports Go

###   Here Are Some of the Services That May Allow You to Stream the World Series  
 
- fuboTV is the streaming service of choice for many sports fans, and it includes a feed of your local Fox station if you live in a participating market.

 
- Sling TV includes Fox, but make sure that you choose the Sling Blue or Sling Orange + Blue package. The Sling Orange package doesn't include Fox.

##   How to Watch the World Series for Free Without Streaming  
 

If you exhausted all your streaming options, it may be possible to watch the World Series for free. Since the World Series is broadcast on Fox, you can watch the whole thing on your local Fox station, even if you don't have cable.

 
Network television stations like Fox are only available through online streaming services if those services have reached an agreement with the local affiliate in your area. If your local Fox station has not reached an agreement with any streaming service, you can't watch the World Series with this method. To verify the availability of Fox in your area, visit the site of each streaming service and enter your ZIP code.
 

The best way to find out if you are within range of a Fox station is to use a tool like the FCC DTV Reception Map. Enter your ZIP code or full address, and the tool shows you the television stations that are located within range.

 

Many stations that are listed as having strong signals can be received with inexpensive indoor antennas, while moderate and weak stations require more expensive outdoor antennas.

 

There are a number of other tools, like Antenna Web, that provide more information about the type of antenna you need.

 

If you don't have a television, pair a USB TV tuner with the antenna of your choice and watch local television, including big events like the World Series, on your computer. This is a great alternative for sports fans who don't own televisions and also don't have access to Fox through online streaming services due to geographical restrictions.
