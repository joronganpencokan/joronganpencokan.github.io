After the launch of Samsung Galaxy Note 9; one of the most popular battle royale game “Fortnite” also made its debut on Android. The game was initially made available only for selective high-end Samsung devices, but it is now available for other devices. You will need to sign up for an invite to the official Fortnite page.

Fortnite will not be available on Google Play Store, you will need to download the APK from their official site. However, if you’re thinking you can just download the APK and sideload it; you can try but you’ll fail.

When it finds out that your device is not on that list, then you would be able to download the content.
 
But do not lose hope yet. Quinny899, a recognized developer at XDA Forums, modified the game’s APK and disable the device verification check. If you have a device that meets the specification, you can now run it even if it is not on the list of supported devices. Here’s how to install Fortnite without an invite.
