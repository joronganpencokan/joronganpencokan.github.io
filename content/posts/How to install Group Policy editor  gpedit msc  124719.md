The Group Policy Editor is a powerful tool that can be used to configure many aspects of your Windows computer, such as security settings, startup and shutdown behavior, user accounts, and much more.

To do this, open the Group Policy Editor and navigate to the following section:

User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Start Menu and Taskbar

Here, you'll find many options that can be used to customize your Windows interface. For instance, you can hide the taskbar, remove the Start menu, or even disable the apps list entirely.

These features can consume a lot of resources and can slow down your computer, especially if you're running an older machine.

To disable these features, open the Group Policy Editor and navigate to the following sections:

Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds

Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update

Here, you'll find options that can be used to disable the Windows Telemetry service, prevent Windows from downloading updates automatically, and much more.
