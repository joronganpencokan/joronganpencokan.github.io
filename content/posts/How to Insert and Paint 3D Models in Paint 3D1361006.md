## Step 1: Launch Paint 3D

The first step in revolutionizing your art game is to launch Paint 3D. To do this, you need to open the start menu and search for Paint 3D. Once you find the app, click on it to launch it.

## Step 2: Choose a 3D Model

The next step is to choose a 3D model that you want to use. You can either create your own 3D model using Paint 3D or choose from the numerous models that are available in the library. If you decide to create your own model, Paint 3D has easy-to-use 3D modeling tools that enable you to create a variety of shapes and objects.

## Step 3: Insert the 3D Model

Once you have chosen your 3D model, the next step is to insert it into your artboard. To do this, click on the “Menu” button located at the top of the screen and select “3D Models”. From the dropdown menu, select “Load 3D Model”. Choose the model that you want to insert and click on it.

## Step 4: Adjust the 3D Model

After inserting the 3D model, you may need to adjust its size and position. To do this, select the “3D Objects” tab located on the right side of the screen. From there, you can use the “Resize” and “Position” tools to adjust the model to your desired size and position.

## Step 5: Color the 3D Model

After adjusting the 3D model, the next step is to color it to match your artwork. To do this, select the “3D Objects” tab and click on the “Paint 3D” button. From there, you can choose from a variety of paint colors and tools, including the brush tool, fill tool, and spray paint tool. Once you have colored your 3D model, you can also add special effects and textures to make it stand out.

## Step 6: Save and Share

The final step in revolutionizing your art game is to save your artwork and share it with the world. To save your work, click on the “Menu” button and select “Save As”. Choose the file format that you want to use and give your artwork a name. Once you have saved the file, you can share it on social media, print it, or even use it in a professional project.

In conclusion, if you want to take your art game to the next level, then you need to start using Paint 3D. With its easy-to-use 3D modeling tools, you can create stunning 3D models and insert them into your artwork with ease. By following the above steps, you can revolutionize your art game and create artwork that will stun and amaze your fans.

This article explains how to insert a 2D or 3D image into Paint 3D and paint it using the brushes and corresponding options that are available through the Brushes tab.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Insert 2D or 3D image: Select Menu > Insert. Select the image. Choose Open.Insert 3D model: Choose the 3D library in Paint. Select an object.Paint the image with the tools, adjust tolerance and opacity, apply effects, and choose colors.

 
##   How to Insert Local 2D or 3D Images  
 

In Paint 3D, you can insert 2D images that you want to convert into 3D (or remain in 2D) and already-made 3D images.

 
- Select Menu from the top left of Paint 3D.
 - Choose Insert.
 - When you insert a picture, you have the flexibility to immediately use it with the current canvas that you already have open. This is different from opening a file normally, which starts you with a new, separate canvas.
 - Select the file that you want to be imported into the canvas you currently have open.
 - You can import lots of file types, both 2D pictures like PNG, JPG, JFIF, GIF, TIF/TIFF, and ICO files, as well 3MF, FBX, STL, PLY, OBJ, GLB, and other 3D models.
 - Choose Open.

 
##   How to Insert Online 3D Models  
 

You can also insert a 3D model included with the Paint 3D program.

 

Select Menu from the top left of Paint 3D.

 

Choose Insert.

- Choose 3D library from the top menu in Paint 3D.
 - Search or browse for the object you want to use.
 - Select it to immediately import it onto your canvas.

 
##   Paint Models in Paint 3D  
 

Use the brushes and corresponding options that are available through in the Brushes tab at the top of the program to paint anything, whether you're filling in the lines of your 2D image or adding a splash of color to a 3D object you've built.

 

Choose 3D library from the top menu in Paint 3D.

 

Search or browse for the object you want to use.

 

Select it to immediately import it onto your canvas.

 

Choose the correct tool that serves the purpose you're after. Here's a description of each that might help you pick the right one for your scenario:

 
- Marker: The marker has a uniform stroke everywhere it's used and has a clean, full look to it. It's similar to the pixel pen tool, except that it will bleed parts of the color into nearby pixels for a softer approach. Neighboring pixels that are just out of reach are lightly colored.Calligraphy pen: This tool works like you'd expect a calligraphy pen to work. Its effect is much like the marker's except that the thickness of the strokes change as you speed up and slow down the pen's movement.Oil brush: The oil brush gives a true brush look. It has a "thicker" and more pixelated effect that hides the background image much more than the marker.Watercolor: Use this brush if you need an effect where the color should be faint over some areas, but darker over others. It's really easy to darken the color of the watercolor brush by simply brushing over the same area more than once. It's similar to the spray can tool, except that the edges aren't as soft.Pixel pen: This one looks almost identical to the marker except that unlike the marker, it colors the entirety of every pixel it reaches. This creates a very uniform look that doesn't bleed even a little into any other pixel, which in effect causes rigid edges but also makes it easier to quickly paint next to solid lines.Pencil: The pencil is ideal for a freehand look since it only spans between 5px and 10px.Eraser: The eraser, despite its name, doesn't erase what you've already drawn so that parts of the model will return to a previous state (use History for that). It instead removes every customization on the model while keeping the object intact, useful for starting from scratch without any designs or colors.Crayon: The crayon makes a chalky, almost wet look. Edges are similar to the marker in that nearby pixels are partly opaque, but it's different within the lines because even the center of the strokes aren't fully colored (unless you color over them multiple times).Spray can: This is very much like the watercolor brush except that you can hold down in one place to fill the space with more color, much like a real spray can. Edges are soft like the marker.Fill: The fill tool is a quick way to fill an area with color. Adjust the tolerance setting to determine how much of the image should be colored. A smaller value like 0% will only fill in just a handful of pixels around where you choose, while something larger like 5% can fill a small area like a circle, and 100% will change the color of the entire object. The fill type can be adjusted to Color, All, Side, or Angle.

 
##   Adjust Tolerance and Opacity  
 

Every tool but Fill lets you adjust the thickness of the brush so you can control how many pixels should be colored at once. Some let you choose as small as a 1px area to color with each stroke.

 
As you zoom up to a 3D image, parts of it will become hidden or not easily accessible. Use the y-axis rotation button at the bottom of the object to reach different areas you can paint.
 

Opacity explains the transparency level of the tool, where 0 percent is completely transparent. For example, if the opacity of the marker is set to 10 percent, it will be very light, while 100 percent shows its full color.

 
##   Apply Matte, Gloss, and Metal Effects  
 

Every art tool in Paint 3D can have a matte, gloss, dull metal, or polished metal texture effect.

 

The metal options are useful for things like a rusty or copper look. Matte provides a regular color effect while the gloss texture is a little darker and creates more of a shiny look.

 
##   Choose a Color  
 

On the side menu, below the texturing options, is where you select the color that the Paint 3D tool should use.

 

Choose any of the pre-selected colors from the menu of 18 or pick a temporary current color by choosing the color bar. From there, define the color by its RGB or hex values.

 

Use the eyedropper tool to pick a color that's already present on the canvas. This is an easy way to paint the same color as what already exists on the model when you're not sure which color was used.

 

To make your own custom colors to use later, choose Add color. You can create up to six.
