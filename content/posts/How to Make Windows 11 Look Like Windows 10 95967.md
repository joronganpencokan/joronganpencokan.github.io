Transform Your Windows 11 into Windows 10 with These Easy Hacks!

Windows 11, the latest operating system from Microsoft, is a significant upgrade from its predecessor. However, some users may not be fond of the new look and feel of Windows 11 and may want to switch back to Windows 10. Fortunately, there are some easy hacks that you can use to transform your Windows 11 into Windows 10. In this article, we will discuss some of these hacks.

1. Change the Taskbar

One of the most significant changes in Windows 11 is the taskbar. The new taskbar is centered, which may not be to everyone's liking. You can change the taskbar to the left or right side of the screen, similar to Windows 10. To do this, right-click on the taskbar and select "Taskbar settings." Under "Taskbar behaviors," select "Left" or "Right" from the drop-down menu next to "Taskbar alignment."

2. Enable the Start Menu

Windows 11 has introduced a new Start menu that's different from Windows 10. The new menu displays pinned and recommended apps, recent files, and a search bar. If you prefer the old-style Start menu from Windows 10, you can enable it in Windows 11. Right-click on the taskbar and select "Taskbar settings." Under "Taskbar behaviors," toggle the switch next to "Use Start full screen" to off.

3. Use the Classic Theme

Windows 11 has a new design language called "Fluent Design," which includes rounded edges and new icons. If you prefer the old-style icons and sharp edges from Windows 10, you can use the classic theme in Windows 11. Right-click on the desktop and select "Personalize." Under "Themes," select "Windows (light)" or "Windows (dark)" depending on your preference.

4. Use the Classic File Explorer

Windows 11 has introduced a new File Explorer with a simplified design and new features. If you prefer the old-style File Explorer from Windows 10, you can enable it in Windows 11. Open File Explorer and go to the "View" tab. Click on "Options" and select "Change folder and search options." Under the "View" tab, check the box next to "Launch folder windows in a separate process."

5. Use the Classic Control Panel

Windows 11 has moved many of the control panel settings to the Settings app, which may not be as convenient for some users. If you prefer the old-style Control Panel from Windows 10, you can access it in Windows 11. Right-click on the Start menu and select "Run." Type "control" and click "OK." This will open the classic Control Panel.

In conclusion, with these easy hacks, you can transform your Windows 11 into Windows 10. Whether you prefer the old-style icons, edges, or menus, you can customize your Windows 11 to your liking. Give these hacks a try and see which ones work best for you. Happy customizing!

Windows 11 comes with a fresh new look, and many users like the new interface better than that of Windows 10. Even so, if you find that you’re missing the look and feel of the previous version, you can easily make Windows 11 look like Windows 10. This article explains how.
 
## Create a Restore Point
 
Before you do anything, it would be wise to create a restore point so that you can quickly revert back to the original look of Windows 11, in case you want to go back at some point.
 
- Click on the Start menu on your PC and type “Create a restore point,” then press Enter.
 - In the new “System Properties” window, click on the “Create” button.

 
- A new “System Protection” window will open. You can type a description to help you identify it faster, if you ever need to. Click on the “Create” button to create a system restore point on your PC.

 
Now just go ahead and implement the instructions laid out here to change the look and feel of your Windows 11. 
 
## 1. Adjust Start Menu Location
 
Windows 11 has the Start menu positioned in the center. If you want to move it to the left, as it is in Windows 10, follow the instructions below:
 
- Right-click on the taskbar and select “Taskbar settings.”

 
- Scroll down on the right and click on “Taskbar behaviors” to expand it.

 
- In the “Taskbar alignment” menu, choose “Left.”
 - Your Start menu will appear on the left.

 
Tip: File Explorer has gained tabs in the latest Windows 11 update. We show you how to take advantage of this cool new feature. 
 
## 2. Change the Start Menu Look
 
Follow these steps to make the Windows 11 Start menu look like Windows 10:
 
- Download Open-Shell from the GitHub website.
 - Uncheck the “Classic Explorer” and “Classic IE” options during the installation process.

 
- Once the installation process is complete, open “Open-Shell Menu Settings” by using Windows search. Choose any menu. We’ve selected “Classic with two columns.”

 
- You may want to change the appearance of the Start button to make it look like that of Windows 10. In the same window, check the “Replace Start button -> Custom” and click “Pick image” to upload your image.

 
- Search for a royalty-free image of the Windows 10 Start menu on the Web or take a quick screenshot of the Start menu if you can access a Windows 10 PC. Resize the image so that it can fit nicely into your taskbar. The Start menu on your Windows 11 PC will look like the following image.

 
Tip: take a look at what Windows 11’s new context menus have to offer. 
 
## 3. Get Full Context Menus 
 
If you miss the good old Windows 10 context menus, here’s how to get them back.
 
- Press Windows + R to open the Run window and type regedit in the address bar.

 
- In the Registry Editor, paste the following in the address bar at the top.

 
- Right-click anywhere on the white space on the right and select “New -> Key.”

 
- Name the new key “{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}”.

 
- Right-click on the newly created key in the right sidebar of “Registry Editor” and select “New -> Key” to create a new key again.

 
- Rename the newly created key “InprocServer32.”

 
- Select “InprocServer32” and double-click “Default” on the right. Click “OK” without entering any data.

 
- Close Registry Editor and restart your PC. The old classic Windows 10 context menus should appear when you right-click an empty space on your desktop as well as files or folders.

 
## 4. Get Windows 10 File Explorer 
 
The Windows 10 File Explorer had a ribbon showing menus for easy access. But in Windows 11 File Explorer, many menus are hidden under the ellipses (three-dot) menu.
 
Earlier, it was easy to bring Windows 10 File Explorer on Windows 11 through registry tweaking. However, after the Windows 11 Version22H2 update, this method stopped working. At this time, the only reliable option to bring back Windows 10 File Explorer is a third-party program.
 
- Download the third-party app StartAllBack and install it on your PC. This is a tool that can revive many things from the previous OS version, such as the old Start Menu, Taskbar elements, Ribbon UI in File Explorer, and more.

 
- Open the StartAllBack application and select the “Kinda 10” option.

 
- Close the program and restart your PC. You will see the classic ribbon UI in File Explorer and many other Windows 10-like UI elements on your PC, such as the Start menu, Taskbar, full context menus, etc.

 
Note: you can try this tool for free for 100 days but will then need to buy a subscription to continue using it. 
 
## 5. Use Windows 10 Wallpapers
 
A default Windows 10 wallpaper can change the appearance of your Windows 11 PC and make it feel more like Windows 10.
 
If you don’t have access to a Windows 10 PC to get a default Windows 10 wallpaper, you can search the Web. A website like Wallpaper Cave can help you find copies of default Windows 10 wallpapers. 
 
- Visit Wallpaper Cave and right-click on the wallpaper you want to use on your PC. Click the “Save image as” option to save the image to your PC.

 
- Right-click on the saved image on your PC, then click the “Set as desktop background” option.

 
- Your Windows 11 PC will show the new wallpaper.

 
Good to know: alternatively, you can opt for one of these cool 4K destkop backgrounds for Windows. 
 
## How to Get the Windows 11 Look Back 
 
If, for whatever reason, you want to go back to the Windows 11 look, follow the below directions.
 
- Press Windows + R to open Run.
 - Paste rstrui.exe into the address bar and hit “OK.”

 
- The “System Restore” window will open, asking you to choose a restore point. Select the restore point you created before starting the transition.
