Crafting Netherite tools and armor can be quite challenging, but once you have them, they will give you an unmatched edge when exploring the Nether Biomes. Learning how to craft Netherite will take some time and resources, but it is well worth the effort.

To craft Netherite, you need to obtain a range of different materials. Start with four blocks of any mineral and combine them with four pieces of gold in a crafting table. You will receive the Soul Speed enchantment for your boots when crafting this item. Then, put this new block into a furnace with some Ancient Debris. You need to smelt Ancient Debris with other materials to make Netherite Ingots. Netherite ingots are then used to craft Netherite tools, weapons, and armor, just like any other material.
