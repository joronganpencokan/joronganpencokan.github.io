Search engine giant, Google recently announced a new mobile feature that is set to revolutionize the way people interact with search results on their phones. This feature is set to change the way people scroll forever, and it is nothing like we have seen before.

The new feature announced by Google is called "infinite scrolling", and it is set to change the face of mobile search results. Infinite scrolling is a process by which users can continuously scroll through the search results page without having to click on the traditional "next page" button.

This new feature is set to be a game-changer for mobile users who spend a lot of time scrolling through search results. Infinite scrolling has the potential to significantly reduce the time and effort involved in finding desired search results.

The experience is very similar to what we already see on social media platforms, where users can keep scrolling through their newsfeed without having to click on a "next post" button, and this is precisely what Google's new feature will do.

According to Google, the new feature will work on all modern mobile browsers, and it will be available to everyone in the coming weeks.

One of the most significant advantages of infinite scrolling is that it allows users to get more accurate search results much faster. This is because you can keep browsing through the search results until you find the exact result you are looking for without having to navigate through several pages.

Infinite scrolling is also set to provide a more seamless experience compared to the traditional way of clicking through pages. The feature eliminates the need for waiting for a new page to load each time you click on the "next page" button.

This feature is also expected to significantly improve engagement rates, as users are more likely to stay on the site for longer when they do not have to click multiple times to see search results.

Moreover, the new feature is expected to improve the usability and accessibility of Google's mobile search. This is because infinite scrolling provides a more user-friendly and a more comfortable experience for users with disabilities who may struggle to click on small buttons or navigate through several pages.

In conclusion, Google's new mobile feature is set to be a game-changer in the world of mobile search. With infinite scrolling, we can expect a revolutionary change in user experience, faster search results, and more engagement on mobile devices. This feature could make its way to the desktop version of Google Search, and we are excited to see what other innovative changes Google has in store for us in the future.

Since the beginning of mobile search engines, opening a Google query on your phone has led to just one page of results, but those days are about to end.

 

Google is rolling out continuous scrolling for mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, according to a company blog post. The update will work for both standard web searches and on Google’s dedicated smartphone app across both major smartphone platforms—Android and iOS. 

 

Here's how it works. Opening a Google search brings up a page of results, as usual, but instead of a "see more" prompt at the bottom of the page, new results will keep loading as you scroll down. You simply can keep scrolling until you find a website you want to visit. This feature should be a boon for users who are looking for more open-ended search results.

 

"Most people who want additional information tend to browse up to four pages of search results," wrote company product manager Niru Anand. "With this update, people can now seamlessly do this, browsing through many different results, before needing to click the 'see more' button."

 

Continuous scrolling brings Google search in line with modern "feed-style" smartphone apps, like TikTok and Instagram. 

 

The continuous scrolling feature is available Friday for some users, and "gradually" will roll out to everyone else in the coming days. For now, this update is only for United States residents. 

 
With this update, people can now seamlessly [scroll], browsing through many different results, before needing to click the 'see more' button.
 

This move follows a redesign launched earlier this year, bringing larger text, edge-to-edge search results, and other quality-of-life improvements.
