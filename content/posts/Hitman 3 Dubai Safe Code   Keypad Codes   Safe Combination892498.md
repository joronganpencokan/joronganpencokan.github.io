UNLOCK THE SECRETS OF HITMAN 3'S DUBAI LEVEL: DISCOVER THE SAFE CODES & KEYPAD COMBOS FOR THE ULTIMATE HEIST!

If you are a fan of the Hitman series, you must have experienced the thrill of playing the Dubai level in Hitman 3. This incredible level is full of secrets, challenges, and opportunities that will test your skills as a seasoned assassin.

If you are looking to ace this level and put your skills to the test, you need to know the safe codes and keypad combos that will help you crack the toughest locks and safes in Dubai. In this article, we will explore some of the secrets that will make your heist ultra-successful.

First things first, let's talk about the safe codes.

After completing a few challenges, you will find a safe in the staff locker room on the first floor of the atrium. To open this safe, you need to type in the code "4706." This safe contains a data core which you can use to access the server room later in the level.

Now, let's talk about the keypad combos.

To disable the security cameras in the server room silently, you need to enter two key combinations.

The first combination is 6927, which will unlock the door to the security room where you can disable the cameras without getting caught.

The second code is 7465, which unlocks the door to the penthouse terrace, allowing you to sneak inside unnoticed.

Another keypad you should know about is in the art installation room, where you can find a lever that lowers the penthouse terrace. To unlock the keypad, use the number "1975."

Lastly, there is a locked door on the Penthouse level that will lead you to a secret room with a sniper rifle. To unlock this door, you need to locate and scan three different fingerprints around the level. Once you have scanned all three, the code to unlock the door is "1979."

Knowing these codes and combos will improve your chances of success in the Dubai level, but there is more to this level than just unlocking safes and doors. The level is designed with an intricate web of opportunities that you can enjoy, from disguising yourself as a Sheikh to eavesdropping on conversations to better understand your target's movements.

In summary, the Dubai level in Hitman 3 is a complex and thrilling heist that will test your skills as a hitman. Knowing the safe codes and keypad combinations is just one part of mastering this level. Take your time, study the layout of the level, and learn to exploit the various opportunities that arise. With patience and practice, you can emerge victorious from this heist and mark your name as one of the best assassins in the game.
