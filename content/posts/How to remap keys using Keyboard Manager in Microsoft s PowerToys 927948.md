# Unlock Next-Level Efficiency on Your Keyboard: Learn How to Remap Keys with Keyboard Manager in Microsoft's Powertoys!

If you are someone who spends a lot of time typing on your keyboard, you know the importance of having a keyboard that suits your typing style. While there are many different keyboards available in the market, you can also make use of software tools to customize your keyboard and improve your typing efficiency.

Microsoft has introduced a set of tools called PowerToys, which can help you customize your Windows operating system to your liking. Amongst the many cool features in PowerToys, you will find the Keyboard Manager. This tool will let you remap keys on your keyboard, allowing you to redefine what a key does when you press it.

## Why Should You Remap Keys?

There are several reasons why you might want to remap keys on your keyboard. Here are some examples:

- **Increase efficiency:** You might find it easier and quicker to use certain keys if they were in a different position on your keyboard.
- **Ease of use:** You might suffer from a condition that makes it difficult to use certain keys. By remapping those keys to keys that are easier to use, you could make your typing experience much more comfortable.
- **Personal preference:** Perhaps you simply prefer certain keys over others, for whatever reason.

Regardless of the reason why you want to remap keys on your keyboard, the process is straightforward with Keyboard Manager.

## How to Remap Keys with Keyboard Manager

To get started with remapping keys, you will need to have PowerToys installed on your Windows system. If you don't already have it, you can download it from the Microsoft website.

Once you have PowerToys installed, follow these steps:

1. Launch PowerToys and open the Keyboard Manager tab.
2. Click on the "+ Add a new key remap" button.
3. In the "Physical Key" section, select the key that you want to remap.
4. In the "Mapped To" section, select the key that will replace the key you are remapping.
5. Click on "Ok" to save the changes.

That's it! The key you remapped will now perform the function of the key you mapped it to.

## Conclusion

Customizing your keyboard with Keyboard Manager in PowerToys is a simple process that can help you increase your productivity, ease of use, and typing efficiency. Try it out and see how it can benefit you in your daily tasks.

Num Lock turns on the number pad. F1 conjures up a Help screen. Ctrl+C copies an item. Windows key+E opens File Explorer. 
But you're not stuck with the existing keys or shortcuts. You can modify many of them with the help of a PowerToys tool called Keyboard Manager.
Using Keyboard Manager, you're able to set various commands to use different keys and shortcuts other than their default ones. For example, maybe you want F1 to turn on the number pad or Windows key+C to copy an item. 
As long as the key or shortcut follows certain rules and doesn't conflict with keys and shortcuts reserved by Windows, you can redefine it however you'd like. Here's how this works.

## How to remap keys using Keyboard Manager in Microsoft's PowerToys
 
## How to remap a shortcut


At the main Keyboard Manager screen, click the entry for Remap a shortcut. Click the dropdown menu to select the physical shortcut or click the Type key to type it. The shortcut must start with a modifier key, meaning Alt, Ctrl, Shift, or Win. After choosing or typing the modifer key, select or type the accompanying key. For example, if you wish to redefine Win+F, choose Win in the first column and F in the second column.
For example, you can't remap Win+L (locks Windows) or Ctrl+Alt+Del (gives you access to Task Manager) as those are reserved shortcuts. But you can remap the function keys F1-F12. If you try to redefine a reserved key in Keyboard Manager, you'll get a slap on the wrist to prevent you from proceeding.
Click the dropdown window and scroll through all the choices until you find the one you want.
Alternatively, click the Type button and press the key you wish to redefine. Then click OK to submit it.

For example, to replace F1 with F12 as the Help command, choose F1 as the mapped-to key. Either click the dropdown menu and select the mapped-to key from the list, or click the Type button and press the key. When you're done, click OK to activate the remapping.

Next, choose the shortcut or key that you wish to remap to the physical shortcut you selected. For example, if you want Win+E to be the mapped-to shortcut, choose Win in the first column and E in the second. You can also select an individual key instead of a shortcut.
By default, your new mapping will work across Windows and all applications. But you may want to limit it to just a specific app, such as Microsoft Word or Google Chrome. 
To do this, you first need to find the name of the app's executible file. Right-click on the shortcut for the app in the Start menu, go to More, and select Open file location. Right-click on the app's icon in File Explorer and select Properties. The name of the executable file appears in the Target field. Copy and paste or type that filename in the field under Target App. When done, click OK.

If you limited the remapping to a specific app, open that app. Otherwise, go anywhere in Windows. Press the new keystroke you defined to make sure that it triggers the command from the original physical keystroke.
