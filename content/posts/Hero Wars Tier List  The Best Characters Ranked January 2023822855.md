10. Kai - Kai is an excellent damage dealer with effective crowd control abilities, such as slowing down enemies' movement and attack speeds.

11. Aurora - Aurora is a versatile support hero that provides fantastic healing to her team. 'Glacier Shield,' her ultimate ability, creates an ice shield around all allied characters, reducing damage taken by 75% for a few seconds.
