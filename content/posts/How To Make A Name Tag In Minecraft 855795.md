Instead, they are obtained from Structures like Dungeons, Mineshafts, and Woodland Mansions in Java Edition while in Bedrock Edition you can them in Buried Treasure as well. The drop rates from each Structure are as follows:
 
Java Edition:
 
- Dungeon: 28.3%
 - Mineshaft: 42.3%
 - Woodland Mansion: 28.3%

 
Bedrock Edition:
 
- Dungeon: 28.3%
 - Mineshaft: 42.3%
 - Woodland Mansion: 27.9%
 - Buried Treasure: 34.3%

 
You can get Name Tags by Fishing. Name Tags are part of the Treasure category, not only it has a 5% but also a 1/6 chance in the Loot Table of the Treasure category. You can increase the odds by applying the Luck of The Sea III Enchantment on the Fishing Rod. The easiest way to obtain Name Tags is trading with a Master Librarian with approximately 20 Emeralds depending on your reputation with the Villagers.

You can rename all mobs except for a player or the Ender Dragon. Once used you cannot remove the Name Tag. The Name Tag can be renamed in the Anvil at the cost of 1 Experience Level. Once renamed just right-click on the mob you want to rename. Name Tags have cool Easter Eggs which change the properties of certain mobs.
