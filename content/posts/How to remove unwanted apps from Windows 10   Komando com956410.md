### Delete Windows 10 Apps


We’ve told you that Microsoft has improved Windows with the release of Windows 10 in 2015, including numerous updates since then. It has made it easier to control the programs you have on your computer, for instance.
One way to get rid of apps takes just a few clicks. Click on the start button (the Windows icon in the lower-left corner of your screen) >> right-click on the app you want to get rid of >> choose Uninstall.
Here’s another way: Start button >> Settings >> Apps >> Apps & Settings >> scroll down to the app you want to delete and click on it >> Uninstall.
Bonus: Try the FREE CCleaner program to delete unwanted software and bits and pieces of programs that are slowing your computer down.

 
### Delete Android Apps


You’d think that deleting apps from your smartphone would be easy, right? After all, it’s easy to do just about everything else from your Android, like taking photos, sending texts, chatting on Messenger and so much more.
Unfortunately, Google has made it tough to delete apps that it wants you to keep, notably from Google-owned companies. There are ways to get rid of most apps.

## Don’t Delete these Windows 10 Apps
 
### Edge


Microsoft used to be the king of the internet. Remember Internet Explorer?
You might still have it on your smartphone or laptop. But it was long ago overshadowed by Google Chrome.
Window’s Microsoft Edge is its newest web browser. While it’s not very popular, it’s actually a pretty good browser.
It has extensions, which you’ve gotten accustomed to using on Chrome and Firefox. Plus, it has good security, a built-in PDF reader and other cool features.
More important, some non-Microsoft software programs are designed to work with Edge. So, your Windows 10 may not work as intended if you delete it.

 
### Cortana


We know, we know. Cortana can be a pain in the neck.
That’s true especially when you’re trying to get your workday started and Cortana would rather freeze your computer while it asks you a random question. However, Cortana runs your local searches, so you don’t want to get rid of it.
Plus, it’s nice to have options. You may find yourself needing Cortana’s help one day when another virtual assistant isn’t working — “Cortana, help!”
Android Tip: Here’s how to turn off Cortana >> click on Cortana >> click on the notebook icon on the left side >> About Me >> select your email address >> Sign Out.
