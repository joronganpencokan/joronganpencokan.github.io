Homescapes is one of the most enjoyable puzzle games available on both Android and iOS platforms. However, as you progress through levels, the challenges become more difficult and can seem almost impossible to overcome. That’s where cheats and tips come in handy, enabling you to unlock infinite coins and tackle every level head-on.

Here we’ll take a look at some of the cheats and tips that will help you master the game without spending a dime.

Cheats:

1. Earn rewards by connecting your game to Facebook. To earn rewards including free coins, you need to connect your game to your Facebook account. This can be done quickly and easily through the settings menu.

2. Use power-ups to your advantage. Homescapes offers various power-ups, such as bombs and rockets, that can help you clear obstacles and complete levels faster. Take the time to understand what each power-up does and use it when applicable.

2. Focus on completing main objectives. Homescapes levels often have multiple tasks, but your main objective should be your priority. Once you’ve completed the main objective, you can focus on smaller tasks.

3. Take your time. Don’t rush through levels. Take the time to plan your moves and think ahead. Sometimes the best move is to wait until you have more available power-ups.

4. Use a strategy. Develop a strategy that works well for you. One helpful strategy is to start from the bottom and work your way up to the top.
