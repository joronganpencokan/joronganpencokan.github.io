# Unleash the Power of Your Bluetooth Earphones: Discover the Secret to Boosting Volume!

If you've ever started up your favorite podcast or playlist on your Bluetooth earphones, only to find that the sound is not quite as robust as you'd like it to be, you might be wondering if there's any way to boost the volume. The good news is that there absolutely is! With just a few simple tweaks, you can quickly unleash the full power of your Bluetooth earphones and enjoy a listening experience that's truly unforgettable.

So, how exactly can you boost the volume of your Bluetooth earphones? There are several different tricks and tips that you can try. Let's take a closer look at some of the most popular methods:

## Adjust Your Device Volume

The first and often most obvious step to increase the volume of your Bluetooth earphones is to adjust the volume on the device you're using them with. This could be your phone, tablet, or laptop. Simply locate the volume control and raise the volume until you have the desired level of sound.

## Adjust Your Earphone Volume

You might be thinking, "But I already turned up the volume on my device, and it's still not loud enough." However, it's important to remember that most Bluetooth earphones also come with their own volume controls. Look for the controls on the earphone's cable or on a touchpad on the earphone itself. Make sure to adjust both the left and right earphone volumes.

## Use an EQ App

Many people don't realize that they can use an equalizer (EQ) app to adjust the sound levels of their Bluetooth earphones. This can be especially helpful if you notice that certain songs or podcasts aren't as loud as others. With an EQ app, you can customize the sound profile to your liking and ensure that everything you listen to is as loud and clear as possible.

## Use a Volume Booster App

If you're really struggling to get the volume you want out of your Bluetooth earphones, you might want to consider using a volume booster app. These apps work by increasing the overall volume of your device beyond what is possible with the built-in controls. Some of the most popular volume booster apps include Volume Booster Pro and Sound Amplifier.

## Upgrade Your Bluetooth Earphones

Finally, if you've tried all of the above tips and still aren't satisfied with the volume of your Bluetooth earphones, it might be time to consider upgrading to a newer, more advanced model. There are many Bluetooth earphones on the market that are specifically designed for audiophiles and offer incredible sound quality and volume.

In conclusion, if you're not happy with the volume of your Bluetooth earphones, don't give up hope! With the above tips and tricks, you can boost the volume to a level that meets your needs and enhances your listening experience. Give them a try today!

The popularity and the quality of a Bluetooth headset have increased this past few years. More and more of the smartphone manufacturers are removing the headphone port from their device. But still, the quality and the loudness of the sound from a good old pair of wired headphones is something a wireless one may take time to replicate. You cannot do anything about the quality, but you sure can increase the loudness of a wireless headset. Here’s how to increase the volume of Bluetooth earphones.
 
## Increase the volume of Bluetooth earphones
 
To protect the user’s ear from hearing damage, Android has set the max volume for Bluetooth earphones quite low. There was a separate control for increasing the max volume before Android 7 Nougat for both Bluetooth speakers and wired earphones or headsets. After Nougat, that option as gone. In the days of wired earphones, this was not a problem as the loudness was still pretty high. But after the trend of removing the headphone jack took over, this has become a problem.
 

 
There is, however, a workaround to that inside Android’s Developer options. After you finish this guide, you will find different controls for the Bluetooth volume and device volume. You will then be able to max out the volume at your own risk and enjoy the sound to full capability. The steps are simple so you will have no problem following them. Just follow these instructions.
 
Step 1: Open Settings.
 
Step 2: Scroll down, find and tap on System.
 
Step 3: Select About phone.
 
Step 4: Find Build number and then tap on it 7 times in rapid succession. This will enable Developer options.
 
Step 5: You can find the newly unlocked Developer options in Settings > System.
 
Step 6: Inside Developer options, there is a section called Networking.
 
Step 7: On the section, tap on the toggle beside Disable absolute volume to enable it.
 
Step 8: Finally, reboot the device.
 
This will disable the limit that Android has set on the earphones’ max volume. If you need to tweak the sound settings and adjust the equalizer, you can go to Sound settings inside the Settings menu. If you are okay with rooting your Android, you should check out Magisk and the modules it offers to help with the audio even more.
