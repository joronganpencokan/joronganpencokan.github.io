Title: Unlock the Secret to Using Popular Music in Your YouTube Videos - The Legal Way!

Introduction:

Have you ever created a video for YouTube, but struggled to find suitable music to accompany it? As much as popular songs can enhance the cinematography of your content, they are often considered copyrighted. This can lead to potential legal repercussions if you use them without proper authorization. In this article, we will share tips on how to legally use popular music in your YouTube videos.

Section 1: Understanding Copyright Law

Music can be copyrighted as intellectual property, which means that it is owned by an individual or a music label. When it comes to using popular music in your YouTube videos, you need to understand the legalities that come with it. The copyright owner has the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and perform the song. Any unauthorized use of copyrighted music can lead to a lawsuit, heavy fines, and even the deletion of your channel.

Section 2: Using Royalty-Free Music

One way to avoid legal complications is to use royalty-free music in your videos. These are tracks that have been released under alternative licenses that allow for public use with some restrictions. There are a variety of websites that offer royalty-free music at an affordable rate, such as Epidemic Sound or Audio Jungle. You can also find free royalty-free music on YouTube Audio Library. However, before using any of these tracks, it’s important to read the license agreement to ensure you don’t violate any terms and conditions.

Section 3: Getting Permission From Copyright Owners

Another way to legally use popular music in your YouTube videos is by getting permission from the copyright owners first. Depending on the artist, some may be more lenient than others when it comes to their music being used on social media. To request permission to use a song, you can contact the artist or record label directly. Some artists may allow the use of their music for a fee or give you a license to use their tracks. However, getting permission can be time-consuming and requires patience.

Section 4: Utilizing YouTube’s Music Policies

YouTube has its own music policies, which enable you to legally use popular music in your videos. However, this depends on the song, and you must be careful to review the policy requirements for each piece of music you want to use. YouTube’s Creative Commons library allows for the use of certain songs with the option to monetize your videos. Additionally, YouTube’s Content ID system ensures that copyright owners are compensated for the use of their music. However, you must make sure that your video does not violate any conditions set forth by the copyright owner, or you run the risk of having your video taken down.

Conclusion:

Using popular music in your YouTube videos can enhance the quality of your content, but it must be done legally. From understanding copyright law to utilizing YouTube’s policies, there are several options available to ensure that your videos comply with copyright law. By using royalty-free music, obtaining permission, and following YouTube’s music policies, you can produce high-quality YouTube videos without any risk of legal repercussions. Unlocking the secret to using popular music in your YouTube videos – the legal way – is not as difficult as you might think!

The music rights holder could issue a copyright claim on your video, resulting in the video being taken down or the audio stripped from it. The good news is that there are options to help you stay legal with your YouTube music playlist.

##   Finding Copyrighted Commercial Music to Add to Your Videos  
 

The YouTube Commercial Music Policies section contains many current and popular songs that users have shown an interest in using. They usually come with some restrictions. The restriction may be that the song is blocked in certain countries or that the owner may place ads on your video to monetize the use of the music. The list also includes songs that you are not allowed to use.

 

To view the copyrighted commercial music list, click Have different music in your video? Check its copyright policies in the bar at the top of the Audio Library screen to open the Music Policies screen.

 
##   YouTube Restriction Types  
 

Each song in the Music Policies list is accompanied by the restrictions that the music owner has set for its use on YouTube. In most cases, they apply to the original song and also to any cover of that song by anyone else. They include:

 
- A comment on where the original music or covers can be used. This may be Viewable worldwide, Viewable everywhere except 2 countries, Not viewable in 74 countries, and other similar entries. You don't want to choose a song that isn't usable in the U.S. because your video would be blocked here. If you see a notice that the music is blocked in a group of countries, tap on the entry to open the list of countries and see which ones won't be able to view your video. You will typically see a note that Ads can appear. This means that the music owner can place ads on your video in exchange for your use of the owner's music. If you don't like the idea of the music owner monetizing your video, you may need to select from the free songs in the Audio Library because most of the copyrighted music has this disclaimer.You may see This song is not available for use in your YouTube video along with a warning that your video may be blocked if you use it. Don't use it.

 

For example, at the time of publication, Gangnam Style is not allowed in videos, Uptown Funk is blocked in over 200 countries, and they don't all mention that "ads can appear."

 
Using one of these commercial songs legally on YouTube does not grant you the right to use it anywhere else. Also, copyright holders can change the permissions they grant for the use of their music at any time.
