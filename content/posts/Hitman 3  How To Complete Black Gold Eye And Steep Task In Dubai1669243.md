Title: You Won't Believe How This Gamer Beat the Infamous Black Gold Eye and Steep Task in Hitman 3 Dubai!

Introduction:

Hitman 3 Dubai is one of the most popular and challenging video games of 2021. The game offers a thrilling experience for gamers who love to solve puzzles, complete tasks and beat challenging missions. However, two of the most dreaded tasks in Dubai are The Black Gold Eye and Steep Task, which have become a nightmare for most gamers. But recently, one gamer has managed to beat both challenges using a unique strategy that has left the gaming community amazed. In this article, we will explore the strategy in detail and how you can replicate it. 

Body:

The Black Gold Eye:

The Black Gold Eye is the first challenge in Dubai, and it involves stealing a special item from a high-security vault. Many gamers have failed this task, but one gamer managed to beat it by taking advantage of the in-game mechanics. The gamer used a combination of loadouts, disguises and distractions to get access to the vault room. The key to success in this challenge is to start with a good disguise that will give you access to different parts of the building without raising suspicion. In this case, the gamer used a security guard disguise and hid a silenced pistol in a nearby container. The gamer then knocked out a few guards using a taser gun and got the vault card. Finally, the gamer used an EMP device to disable the security system and stole the Black Gold Eye without being detected.

Steep Task:

The Steep Task is the second challenge in Dubai, and it involves pushing a target off a skyscraper without getting detected. This task requires precise timing, patience and some creative thinking. The gamer beat this task by luring the target to a specific location using a phone call distraction. Once the target was in position, the gamer used an explosive device to create a distraction, which made the target lean over the balcony. The gamer then pushed the target over the edge, but at the same time, he created a diversion by setting off a fire alarm. This diversion allowed the gamer to escape without being detected by the guards.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, Hitman 3 Dubai is a difficult game, but with the right strategy, gamers can beat any challenge. The Black Gold Eye and Steep Task might seem impossible, but one gamer has shown that it's all about using the right combination of loadouts, disguises and distractions. If you're struggling with any task in Hitman 3 Dubai, remember to take your time, think creatively and don't be afraid to try different strategies until you find the perfect one.

There are many creative ways you can kill your targets in Hitman 3, but the best ones are challenges like Impactful Art & Icarus Challenges. Among all the challenges in Dubai, we loved both the Black Gold Eye and Steep Task challenges. Here’s how you can accomplish both tasks in Dubai.
 
## How to Disguise as Zana Kazem “the Vulture” and Complete Black Gold Eye in Hitman 3
 
To complete the Black Gold Eye Challenge, you need to impale Carl Ingram on his Oil Rig miniature model. The real challenge is to make him position himself in the exact way to accomplish this challenge. First, you need to play through the story mission “Bird of Prey”.
 

 
To initiate this mission you need to take the stairs on the main lobby and go right and keep walking until you see an argument going on between a man and the staff. The man who is being stopped from entering an area is another assassin Zana “The Vulture” Kazem.
 
Once he leaves the area, follow him to the garden. There you can turn on the Sound System on a control panel, and hide in the bushes near it. Kazem will come to check it. This is when you can subdue him, hide his body and take his disguise. Next, you need to meet Carl Ingram under the heavy supervision of his guards. To do this, talk to this receptionist as she will guide you to Ingram.  Also, remember to remove all illegal items from you beforehand, as guards will do a pat-down on you before the meeting.
 
## How to Complete Steep Task Challenge in Hitman 3
 
If you don’t kill Ingram while he is leaning over the oil rig, you can continue till the end of the story mission. Ingram will go to the balcony. You can follow him to see that he will be leaning on the balcony railing. Here you can push him over the railing and walk away as if nothing happened.
 
Also, you can pick up a screwdriver near the television while and tamper with the balcony railing while Ingram is busy standing over his oil rig model. So the railing will be loose and Ingram will fall over as soon as he tries to lean over the railing. Doing these will make you complete the Steep Task Challenge.
 
That’s everything you need to do to complete Black Gold Eye and Steep Task Challenges in Hitman 3. While you are here, also check out some of our other Hitman 3 guides like:
