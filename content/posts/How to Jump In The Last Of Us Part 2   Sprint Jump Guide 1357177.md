Master The Art of Evading Infected & Enemies With This Epic Last of Us Part 2 Sprint Jump Guide!

Last of Us Part 2 has taken the gaming world by storm with its intense narrative, amazing graphics, and action-packed gameplay. One of the gameplay mechanics that often goes unnoticed but holds significant importance is sprint jumping. Sprint jumping can help you evade infected and enemies, save your ammunition, and give you an upper hand in combat. In this guide, we will teach you how to master the art of sprint jumping in Last of Us Part 2.

Before we dive into the techniques of sprint jumping, let's quickly go over the basics. In Last of Us Part 2, sprint jumping involves sprinting and then jumping in a specified direction. To sprint, press and hold the L3 button on your controller. Once you've built up enough momentum, push the jump button, which is X on a PlayStation controller. Simple, right? Now let's get into the real game-changer techniques.

First, let's talk about the 180-degree turn jump. This technique is useful when you are facing enemies or infected while running. Suppose a clicker is right behind you, and you need to turn around and jump over it to save ammunition. In that case, you will need to sprint towards the clicker, jump over it, and immediately press the button to turn, which is Circle on the PlayStation controller. You will complete a 180-degree turn and be facing the opposite direction, giving you a chance to evade the creature and make your escape.

Next, let's discuss the strafe jump. This technique involves running to the left or right and then jumping in the opposite direction. This technique is useful when you are being pursued by multiple enemies or infected, and you need to change directions quickly. All you need to do is hold down the L2 or R2 button, depending on the direction you want to strafe, then sprint and jump in the opposite direction.

Thirdly, let's cover the running jump. This technique involves running towards a high object, such as a wall or container, and then jumping over it. Running jumps are great for creating distance between you and enemies pursuing you or escaping a battle quickly. To perform a running jump, sprint towards the object, jump when you are close, and hold down the X button until you climb over it.

Finally, let's talk about the sprinter jump. This technique is best used when you need to clear gaps or distances quickly. To perform a sprinter jump, sprint towards the gap, jump, and then immediately press the X button again to perform a second jump in mid-air. The double jump will give you extra distance and help you clear the gap safely.

In conclusion, mastering the art of sprint jumping in Last of Us Part 2 can give you an edge in evading infected and enemies, saving ammunition, and escaping dangerous situations. Practice the techniques outlined in this guide to become a sprint jumping pro and survive the world of Last of Us Part 2. Happy gaming!
