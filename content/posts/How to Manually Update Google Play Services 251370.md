Just like every other app, Google Play Services also needs a stable internet connection to get updated. Make sure that the Wi-Fi network that you are connected to is working properly. Try switching on and switching off your Wi-Fi to solve the connectivity issues. You can also reboot your device to solve the network connectivity issues.
 
#### Corrupted Cache Files

Sometimes these residual cache files get corrupted and cause Play Services to malfunction. Follow these steps to clear the cache and data files for Google Play Services.
 
1. Go to the Settings of your phone.
 

 
2. Tap on the Apps option.
 
3 Now select the Google Play Services from the list of apps.
 
4. Now click on the Storage option.

#### Old Android Version
 
#### Unregistered Phone
 
Illegal or unregistered smartphones running on Android OS is common in countries like India, Philippines, Vietnam, and other south-east Asian countries. If the device that you are using is, unfortunately, one of them, then you won’t be able to use Google Play Store and its services as it is unlicensed. However, Google does allow you to register your device on your own and, in this way, update Play Store and Play Services. All that you need to do is visit Google’s Uncertified Device Registration Page. Once you are on the site, you need to fill in the device’s Framework ID, which can be acquired by using the Device ID app. Since the Play Store isn’t working, you need to download the APK file for it and then install it on your device.
