Tower of Fantasy is an MMORPG featuring a vast open world. Being an MMORPG, you can connect with your friends or other players while progressing through TOF. You can run around the expansive open world and defeat enemies, and other horrible world bosses with your friends. But aside from different teams, Crews are another way to connect with other players. So, here’s our guide on how to join a crew in Tower of Fantasy.
 
You need to be at least above level 16 to join or create a Crew. Follow these steps to join a crew in TOF:
 
- Hit the Esc Button or head over to the Main Menu and select the Crew section.

 - Now, you will see several crews with different names, mottos, and levels in that section.
 - You need to select the Crew and hit the Request button at the bottom-right of the screen.
 - Each of these crews can enlist over 150 players.
 - So alternatively, you can also select the “Apply for All requests” to send requests to all the crews.
 - Most of the crews in the list of auto-join enabled players to join instantly.
 - But if you are having trouble finding a vacant crew, check the “Only show crews with Vacancies” option.
