Transform Your Windows Lumia 950 Into a Mini PC - Step-by-Step Guide to Installing Full Version of Windows 10!

Microsoft Lumia 950 had all the latest features we could ask for in a smartphone at the time of its release. But being a Windows phone, it had its limitations, especially when it comes to running desktop apps. But what if we could turn our Windows Lumia 950 into a Mini PC that runs the full version of Windows 10? Sounds exciting? Let's get to the process to transform our phone into a Mini PC with this step-by-step guide.

Before we start, let's make sure our Lumia 950 meets the minimum requirements for running Windows 10:

• 1GB RAM

• 16GB of internal storage

• Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 chip or higher

• Minimum 5.2-inch screen size

• Device should be running Windows 10 Mobile (Threshold) build 10586.107 or higher

If your Lumia 950 meets the above-mentioned requirements, you're ready to proceed with the installation of Windows 10 on your phone. Please be aware that the installation process will erase all the data and application installed on the device. Hence it is highly recommended to back up all important data before proceeding with the installation.

Step 1: Download the Windows 10 Mobile Interop Tools app on your Lumia 950. This app is required to enable the developer mode on your device, and you can download it from here.

Step 2: Open the Interop Tools app and go to the "Registry Browser" section.

Step 3: Navigate to the following path in the registry editor: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\Platform\DeviceTargetingInfo.

Step 4: Change the following registry keys:

• PhoneManufacturer to MicrosoftMDG

• PhoneManufacturerModelName to RM-1085

• PhoneModelName to Lumia 950 XL

Step 5: Go to "Capabilities" tab, and enable "Root Access" and "Registry Access."

Step 6: Now, connect your Lumia 950 to your PC, and download the Full ISO version of Windows 10 from the official Microsoft website.

Step 7: Once the ISO file downloads, mount it via your PC and copy all the files to your SD card.

Step 8: Unmount the ISO file, and insert the SD card into your Lumia 950.

Step 9: Open the "File Explorer" app on your Lumia 950 and navigate to the SD card.

Step 10: Click on the "install.cmd" file, and it will start the installation process.

Step 11: Follow the on-screen instructions given by the installation wizard, and let it finish the installation process. It might take a while to complete the process, so be patient and do not interrupt it.

Step 12: Once the installation finishes successfully, you'll see the Windows 10 OS running on your Lumia 950 screen.

That's it, your Windows Lumia 950 is now transformed into a Mini PC that runs the full version of Windows 10. You can now enjoy all the desktop features and apps on your phone seamlessly. 

Final thoughts:

While it's exciting to turn your Windows Lumia 950 into a Mini PC, it's important to exercise caution and backup all important data before proceeding with the installation. Additionally, it's not recommended to proceed with this process if you do not have technical expertise as it involves some complex steps. Overall, it's a great way to revive an old Lumia 950 and get the most out of it.
