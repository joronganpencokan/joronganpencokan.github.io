Going For A Ride? Don't Leave Without Knowing These Safe Ways To Attach Your Gopro To Your Car Or Truck!

Are you an adrenaline junkie looking for an exciting way to capture your outdoor adventures? A GoPro is the perfect solution to capture all your thrilling moments. From your car or truck, you can document your drive, race or just cruising around with your buds.

GoPros are versatile cameras that can be attached to almost anything, giving you the perfect shot from all angles. But before you strap on your GoPro to your car or truck, keep safety in mind. Here are some safe ways to attach your GoPro to your car or truck.

1. Suction Cup Mount: 

A suction cup mount is a popular and fairly easy way to attach your GoPro to your car or truck. It is designed to secure your GoPro with a powerful suction cup and can be attached to the windshield, car hood or any smooth surface of your vehicle. This mount provides stable and footage for high-speed driving and action shots.

2. Roll Bar Mount:

A roll bar mount is a specialized mount use to attach your GoPro to the car's roll bar or tubes, making it ideal for off-road racing or cruising. The mount has adjustable arms that can fit various bar sizes, and it provides a stable and secure hold for smooth footages.

3. Chest mount:

This mount allows you to wear your GoPro on your chest, giving a unique and dynamic perspective of your driving adventure. It provides hands-free use, and you can quickly adjust the camera's angle to record the action from the driver's point of view.

4. Roof Rack Mount:

A roof rack mount is another option to capture a bird-eye view of your drive. By placing your GoPro on top of the roof rack, it can capture sweeping footage of the road ahead from a high elevation.

5. Magnetic Mount:

If you're looking for a quick and easy way to attach your GoPro while driving, a magnetic mount is a perfect option. It attaches to any metal surface of your car, and it's secure enough to hold your GoPro in place, even during high-speed driving.

Conclusion:

When mounting your GoPro on your car or truck, it's essential to keep safety in mind. Always make sure the mount is secure and stable before recording. Also, be mindful of the laws in your state or country when it comes to filming while driving. Follow these safety tips, and you're sure to capture some fantastic footage of your driving adventures. Get out there and hit the road!

But the problem with this is that this is a fast track to mayhem. If -- or more likely, when -- the GoPro flies off the car, the best you can hope for is that you're down a GoPro. Worse, it could go through someone else's windshield, hit a passerby, or damage something or someone.
And that someone or something might be you or yours or your stuff.
I always work to minimize the risk to others and other people's property, and to minimize the risk to me and my property. This is why I only use good quality mounts such as the 3 Footed Monster Pro.
Now the 3 Footed Monster Pro is big and expensive (and very often on back order). But it's a high quality mount. The magnetic base is strong and does a good job of fixing to ferrous surfaces such as car body panels, street lights, and pretty much anything magnetic you can think of. 
Not only is this a great way to capture footage of the area you're in, but it can also great a great way to capture what's called B-roll footage (footage that's intertwined with the main footage to support the story, offer a different viewpoint, create tension, or to highlight a point).
The magnets have spring shock absorbers that do a fantastic job at minimizing vibration, and the mount is more than enough to hold a GoPro or other action camera to your car or truck (there's also a holder for a smartphone, although I wouldn't recommend using your best daily-driver smartphone for this).
It's also a good idea to clean the area you're going to stick the magnets down onto of any dirt and grime. Not only will that mean the magnets stick better, it'll also reduce any risk of damaging the paintwork.
Now, as good as this mount is, and as reliable it has been so far -- it's never let me down -- I still wouldn't be happy with relying solely on the magnets. 
It's a good idea to attach the mount to the vehicle using strong cord or straps. I use 550lb breaking strain paracord because I have loads of it, and it's cheap and very reliable.
But there's a right way and a wrong way secure the mount and camera to the car.
The wrong way is to dangle it from a wing mirror. If the mount breaks loose (which is very unlikely with a magnetic mount because magnets are always magnets), the it's going to dangle and swing about uncontrollably and cause all sorts of pandemonium.
The right way is to attach it at both ends. Here I've wrapped the cord around the car door so even if the mount was to come loose, it can't move much.
Note that it's very possible that you mount and the camera is going to get dirty and muddy, and that stones can fly up and hit the camera at high speed. This is something that can be harsh on cameras, and it's why I don't recommend using your smartphone.

I drove quite a few miles over rough and wet country roads with the mount attached, and it didn't move in the least.
