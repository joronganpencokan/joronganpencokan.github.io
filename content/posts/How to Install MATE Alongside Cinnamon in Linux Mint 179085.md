# Revolutionize Your Linux Mint Experience: Learn How to Install Mate Alongside Cinnamon!

Are you a Linux Mint user? Are you tired of using the same Cinnamon desktop environment? If you answered yes to both of these questions, then it's time to revolutionize your Linux Mint experience! In this article, we'll show you how to install the Mate desktop environment alongside Cinnamon.

## Why Mate?

Mate is a lightweight desktop environment that was originally forked from the Gnome 2 desktop. It provides a traditional desktop experience and is known for its speed and reliability. Mate is ideal for users who prefer a minimalistic desktop environment that is easy to navigate.

## Installing Mate Alongside Cinnamon

Before we begin the installation process, it's important to note that some Linux Mint editions come with Mate pre-installed. If this is the case for you, there's no need to follow the steps below. However, if you're using a Linux Mint edition without Mate, then follow the steps below.

1. Open the terminal and type the following command: 

```sudo apt-get install mate-desktop-environment```

2. Once the installation process is complete, log out of your current session.

3. At the login screen, click the icon that appears next to your username. This will display a drop-down menu with different desktop environments to choose from.

4. Select Mate from the list and login to your account.

Congratulations! You've successfully installed Mate alongside Cinnamon.

## Switching Between Mate and Cinnamon 

Now that you have Mate installed, it's important to know how to switch between Mate and Cinnamon. Here's how:

1. Log out of your current session.

2. At the login screen, click the icon that appears next to your username.

3. Select the desktop environment you wish to use and login to your account.

It's that simple!

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, installing Mate alongside Cinnamon is a great way to revolutionize your Linux Mint experience. Mate is a lightweight desktop environment that provides a traditional desktop experience, while Cinnamon is a modern desktop environment that provides a sleek and intuitive interface. By having both desktop environments installed, you can easily switch between them and enjoy the best of both worlds. We hope that this article has been helpful in showing you how to install and switch between Mate and Cinnamon. Happy Linux Minting!

There are several reasons one may like having multiple desktop environments side by side on one Linux distro. User interface, resource usage, extra features, and stability are some reasons some keep multiple desktop environments.
 
Linux Mint comes in different versions, with different desktop environments and default applications. Cinnamon, MATE, Xfce, and KDE are just some of the different versions of Linux Mint. Initially, you have to install one of these. Then, you can later install another desktop environment on top of it and run them side by side.
 
## The Difference
 

 
The Cinnamon desktop environment is the flagship of Linux Mint. It is based on the Gnome 3 desktop. It has, arguably, the prettiest interface. Cinnamon has lots of visual effects; therefore, it is more intensive on computer resources.
 
On the other hand, the MATE desktop environment is a continuation of the Gnome 2 desktop. It has a less stylish user interface compared with Cinnamon. That is not to say it is inferior. On the plus side, it consumes less system resources and is suitable for old computers with limited resources. For instance, I prefer to use MATE whenever I am about to use resource-intensive programs to reduce the stress on my RAM and processors.
 
## Default Programs
 
Furthermore, the two desktop environments differ in respect to the default programs they come installed with. For instance, MATE has Caja as its default file manager. Cinnamon’s default is Nautilus Nemo. Nonetheless, if you don’t like any default program, you are free to install and use one you like. You can make Cinnamon’s default file manager on MATE and vice versa.
 
## Keeping Both
 
It is possible for a Cinnamon user to install the MATE desktop alongside it and switch between them seamlessly. Similarly, a MATE user can also install and use the Cinnamon desktop without any problems. This tutorial assumes the user only has Linux Mint Cinnamon installed. The installation process is quite simple: just fire up the terminal and type the following command to install MATE and all of its required programs.
 
That’s all, you’re done! This process can also be done through Software Manager or Synaptic. Simply search for mint-meta-mate, select it and click Install or Apply.
 
The same instructions apply to anyone on the MATE edition who wants to install Cinnamon. The only thing is that mint-meta-cinnamon, instead of mint-meta-mate, needs to be installed.
 
Don’t worry if you don’t see any indication that it installed after doing so. To switch to the MATE desktop, you need to first log out of your Cinnamon session.
 
Once on the log-on screen, select the desktop environment icon (this varies with display managers and may not look like the one in the image), and choose MATE from the drop-down options.
 
You should now be logged into the MATE desktop environment. You don’t need to learn anything extra to use MATE. It is intuitive. Go on and take a tour of the desktop environment. Should you want to customize the interface, do so via Control Center, under Appearance.
 
## Conclusion
 
If you like a desktop environment more than your current one, it doesn’t always have to be an “X vs. Y” situation. You can sometimes install them side by side and enjoy the benefits of each. However, always check to see if it will not break anything.
