Last year MTE gave you a hands on review of the beta release of Ubuntu One, Canonical’s answer to the popular Dropbox file syncing service. Ubuntu One allows users to have a local folder on their computers linked and synced with a folder on an Ubuntu One server. They can also share files with their other computers and even with other users.
 
This was good news for many mobile Ubuntu users who needed the flexibility that online storage space affords them. Unfortunately, KDE users, those who use Kubuntu, were left out of the initial release. In order to use Ubuntu One, they would have to install the Gnome client or use only the web-based interface.
 
Now, all of that has changed with the development of Ubuntu One KDE Client.  It is easy to download, setup, and install, and MTE will take you through the entire process.

 
### Sign up for Ubuntu One
 
The process is the same as it would be if you were registering from within Gnome.
 
1. Visit one.ubuntu.com
 
2. Click “Subscribe”
 
3. Choose the free 2GB plan or the $10 per month 50GB plan
 
4. Sign in with your existing Launchpad account or create a new one
 
Once you are subscribed, you can see the web interface. All that is left is connecting your desktop interface to your account.
 

 
### Download Ubuntu One KDE Client
 
You can download and install the client from launchpad.net or install it through the PPA using the following method:
 
1. Open Konsole (or your terminal app of choice)
 
2. Type the following string:
 
It should add the repository and fetch the PPA’s key.
 
3. One the repository has been added, update your apt-get list:
 
4. Install Ubuntu One KDE Client:
 
Note: You can also add the repository and install the client using KPackageKit or another graphical interface.
 
### Getting Started
 
Now that you have the client installed, start it and make sure the installation worked.
 
1. Press Alt-F2 (or right click the desktop and click “Run Command”)
 
2. Type ubuntuone-kde and press Enter
 
3. An icon shaped like a hard drive with a cloud on it will appear. Right click it.
 
4. Click “Open Folder”
 
You should now have your local Ubuntu One folder open, and it should have automatically added a link to it in your “Places” bookmarks in Dolphin.  The path for the folder is /home/username/Ubuntu One.
 
5. Right click the icon again and click “Connect” to make sure it is connected.
 
6. Now, to test it, right click inside the Dolphin window of the Ubuntu One folder and click “Create New” and “Text file”
 
7. Name the file “test” and click OK.
 
Finally, open your web browser and return to the one.ubuntu.com web interface. Your test file should now appear under “My Files”.  With that you have successfully setup your Ubuntu One account within KDE.  Because the folder itself is on your local computer, you can link to it and even create a Folder View just as you normally would with any KDE folder. Just always keep in mind that Ubuntu One is an online service, so always keep local copies of any files you share on it. It is also still in BETA, so be extra careful. Now Kubuntu users can enjoy the benefits of Ubuntu One and share with their Ubuntu associates.
