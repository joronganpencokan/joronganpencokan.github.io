Unlock the Secret Wine Cellar in Hitman 3 with the Ultimate Code Combo and Laser Door Hack!

Are you a wine lover and a big fan of the Hitman franchise? Well, we have some exciting news for you! There is a secret wine cellar in Hitman 3 that can be unlocked by following some advanced techniques. In this article, we’ll guide you on how to unlock the secret wine cellar in Hitman 3 by using the ultimate code combo and laser door hack.

Step 1 – Find the Keycard:

Before we start with the code combo and laser door hack, the first step is to find the keycard. The keycard is hidden in the basement of the mansion in the Mendoza level. Once you reach the basement, take out the guard and look for the keycard in the box to the left of the wine crates.

Step 2 – The Code Combo:

Now that you have the keycard, head to the wine cellar and enter the first code. The first code is 1945. But beware, this code will only unlock the first door leading to the second code. Now, enter the second code 1975 to unlock the second door of the wine cellar.

Step 3 – The Laser Door Hack:

You’re not done yet! To access the secret wine cellar, you’ll have to hack the laser door. The laser door is located in the corner of the wine cellar. However, the hack requires a lot of skill, so ensure that you have a high hacking level before attempting it.

Start by disabling the security cameras in the room to avoid any suspicion. Next, use your hacking device and start hacking the laser door, but don’t mess up! If you fail, the alarm will go off, and you’ll be caught. So, take your time and be cautious while hacking the laser door.

Step 4 – Enjoy the Secret Wine Cellar:

If you’ve successfully completed the first three steps, congratulations, you can now access the secret wine cellar! The wine cellar is filled with the finest and rarest wines, so be sure to take your time and savour each sip.

Conclusion:

Unlocking the secret wine cellar in Hitman 3 with the ultimate code combo and laser door hack is an advanced and challenging task. However, if you’re up for the challenge, the rewards are well worth it. So, grab your hacking device and get to work, but don’t forget to enjoy the fruits of your efforts!

## What is the Hitman 3 Wine Cellar Code?
 

 
The Wine Cellar Code is 1945. With it, you can turn off the laser grid and head to the Wine Fridge. The clue to get this code can be found in two ways. You can either listen to the Guard when he’s talking to the Sommelier and he will say that the code is the ending year of World War II. Apart from this, another way to obtain this code is to check out the wine label which shows 1945 Grand Paladin. That’s the year the wine was made.
 
So, 1945 is the Wine Fridge Laser Door Code you have to input on your keypad. You will find it on the first floor of the Wine Cellar where you will see the Sommelier as well.
