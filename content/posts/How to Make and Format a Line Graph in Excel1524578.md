Introduction:

Data visualization is a crucial component of any data analysis process. It is a technique that helps to visualize large data sets in a more comprehensive and understandable way. Line graphs are one of the most popular and effective data visualization tools in Excel. They can display trends, patterns, and fluctuations in data sets, making them perfect for professional-level analysis.

In this article, we'll walk you through the best practices for creating a professional-level line graph in Excel.

Step 1: Select and organize data

Before creating a line graph in Excel, it is important to select and organize the data. This step ensures that the graph is accurate and provides reliable insights.

Select the data to be plotted and ensure that it's in a consistent format. You should remove any unnecessary data, such as outliers or data points that skew the overall picture. Also, ensure that your data is in a logical order, preferably in chronological order, as it is easier to track data over time this way.

Step 2: Create a line graph

Once your data is organized, it's time to create your line graph. To create a line graph, follow these simple steps:

1. Select the data set you want to plot.

2. Go to the 'Insert' tab and click on the 'Line Graph' icon.

3. Select the type of line graph you want to use (most commonly used one is 'Line with Markers').

4. Customize your graph using the 'Design' and 'Format' tabs. You can choose different colors, fonts, and styles to create a visually appealing graph.

Step 3: Clean up the graph

After you've created your line graph, it's time to clean it up. You can optimize your line graph by doing the following:

1. Remove any unnecessary elements such as grids, labels, or legends that do not add any value to your chart. 

2. Label your axes and title your graph to clearly communicate the intended message.

3. Ensure your data labels are visible and legible by adjusting their font size, color, and orientation.

Step 4: Analyze and interpret the graph

Now that you have created an amazing line graph in Excel, it's time to analyze and interpret it. Look for trends, patterns, and fluctuations in the data. This will help you to draw meaningful insights and conclusions from the data set.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, a line graph is a powerful data visualization tool that can help you to analyze and make sense of large data sets. Excel is an excellent software for creating professional-level line graphs. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can unlock the secrets to creating an amazing line graph in Excel that will help you achieve professional-level data visualization capabilities.

This article explains how to add a line graph to a Microsoft Excel sheet or workbook to create a visual representation of the data, which may reveal trends and changes that might otherwise go unnoticed. Instructions cover Excel 2019, 2016, 2013, 2010, and Excel for Microsoft 365.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Highlight the data you want to chart. Go to Insert > Charts and select a line chart, such as Line With Markers. Click Chart Title to add a title.To change the graph's colors, click the title to select the graph, then click Format > Shape Fill. Choose a color, gradient, or texture.To fade out the gridlines, go to Format > Format Selection. Click a horizontal gridline, then change the transparency to 75%.

 
##   Make a Basic Line Graph  
 

The steps below add a simple, unformatted graph that displays only the lines representing the selected series of data, a default chart title, a legend, and axes values to the current worksheet.

 
- Enter the data in cells A1 to C6.
 - Highlight the data, including row and column headings.
 - Click on the Insert tab of the ribbon.
 - In the Charts section of the ribbon, click on the Insert Line Chart icon to open the drop-down list of available chart and graph types.
 - Hover your mouse pointer over a chart type to read a description.
 - Click 2D line.
 - The chart will appear on your spreadsheet. Click and hold to move the chart to the right, away from the data table.

 
##   Add the Chart Title  
 

When you insert a chart, its default title is "Chart Title." It doesn't carry over the title from your table, but you can easily edit the chart title.

 

Enter the data in cells A1 to C6.

 

Highlight the data, including row and column headings.

 

Click on the Insert tab of the ribbon.

 

In the Charts section of the ribbon, click on the Insert Line Chart icon to open the drop-down list of available chart and graph types.

 

Hover your mouse pointer over a chart type to read a description.

 

Click 2D line.

 

The chart will appear on your spreadsheet. Click and hold to move the chart to the right, away from the data table.

 
- Click once on the default chart title to select it. A box should appear around the words Chart Title.
 - Click a second time to put Excel in edit mode, which places the cursor inside the title box.
 - Delete the default text using the Delete or Backspace keys on the keyboard.
 - Enter the chart title into the title box.

 
##   Change the Chart's Colors  
 

You can change the chart's colors including the background color, text color, and graph lines.

 

Click once on the default chart title to select it. A box should appear around the words Chart Title.

 

Click a second time to put Excel in edit mode, which places the cursor inside the title box.

 

Delete the default text using the Delete or Backspace keys on the keyboard.

 

Enter the chart title into the title box.

 
- Click next to the chart title to select the entire graph.
 - Click the Format tab of the ribbon.
 - Click the Shape Fill option to open the Fill Colors drop-down panel. Choose a color, texture, gradient, or texture to fill the background.
 - Stay on the Format tab and click the Text Fill option to open the Text Colors drop-down list. Choose the color you want to use. All the text in the title, x- and y-axes, and legend should change.
 - You can change the color for each line in the graph individually.
 - Click once on a line to select it.
 - Small highlights should appear along the length of the line. On the Format tab click the Format Selection option to open the Formatting task pane.
 - Then click the Fill icon (the paint can) in the task pane to open the Line options list.
 - Scroll down to color and click the down arrow next to it to open the Line Colors drop-down list.
 - Click on the color you want to use for the line. Repeat for the other lines, if desired.

 
##   Fade out the Gridlines  
 

Finally, you can also change the formatting of the gridlines that run horizontally across the graph.

 

Click next to the chart title to select the entire graph.

 

Click the Format tab of the ribbon.

 

Click the Shape Fill option to open the Fill Colors drop-down panel. Choose a color, texture, gradient, or texture to fill the background.

 

Stay on the Format tab and click the Text Fill option to open the Text Colors drop-down list. Choose the color you want to use. All the text in the title, x- and y-axes, and legend should change.

 

You can change the color for each line in the graph individually.

 

Click once on a line to select it.

 

Small highlights should appear along the length of the line. On the Format tab click the Format Selection option to open the Formatting task pane.

 

Then click the Fill icon (the paint can) in the task pane to open the Line options list.

 

Scroll down to color and click the down arrow next to it to open the Line Colors drop-down list.

 

Click on the color you want to use for the line. Repeat for the other lines, if desired.

 

The line graph includes these gridlines by default to make it easier to read the values for specific points on the data lines.

 

They do not, however, need to be quite so prominently displayed. One easy way to tone them down is to adjust their transparency using the Formatting Task pane.

 

By default, their transparency level is 0%, but by increasing that, the gridlines will fade into the background where they belong.

 
- Click on the Format Selection option on the Format tab of the ribbon to open the Formatting Task pane.
 - In the graph, click once on one of the horizontal gridlines running through the middle of the graph. There should then be blue dots at the end of each gridline.
 - In the pane change the transparency level to 75% – the gridlines on the graph should fade significantly.

 
##   Avoid Clicking on the Wrong Part of the Chart  
 

There are many different parts to a chart in Excel – such as the chart title and labels, the plot area that contains the lines representing the selected data, the horizontal and vertical axes, and the horizontal gridlines.

 

Click on the Format Selection option on the Format tab of the ribbon to open the Formatting Task pane.

 

In the graph, click once on one of the horizontal gridlines running through the middle of the graph. There should then be blue dots at the end of each gridline.

 

In the pane change the transparency level to 75% – the gridlines on the graph should fade significantly.

 

All of these parts are considered separate objects by the program so that you can format them separately. You tell Excel which part of the graph you want to format by clicking on it with the mouse pointer to select it.

 

If your graph doesn't look like those pictured in this article, it is likely that you did not have the right part of the chart selected when you applied the formatting option.

 

The most common mistake is clicking on the plot area in the center of the graph when the intention is to select the entire chart.

 

The easiest way to select the entire graph is to click in the top left or right corner away from the chart title.

 

If you make a mistake, it can be quickly corrected using Excel's undo feature. Then, click the correct part of the chart and try again.
