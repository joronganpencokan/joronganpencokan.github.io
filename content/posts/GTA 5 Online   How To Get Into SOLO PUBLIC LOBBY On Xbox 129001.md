# Exposed: Secret Hack for GTA 5 Online Xbox Players to Dominate in Solo Public Lobbies!

It's no secret that GTA 5 online lobbies can sometimes be a chaotic and unpredictable place. From griefers and trolls to overzealous bounty hunters, it can be hard to catch a break when you're just trying to have some solo fun.

But what if there was a way to dominate in these lobbies without the hassle of dealing with other players? What if you could have all the benefits of a public lobby without any of the risks? Well, Xbox players, listen up because we have the solution to your problems.

Introducing the secret hack for GTA 5 online Xbox players to dominate in solo public lobbies! This hack will allow you to bypass the normal matchmaking system and create your own solo public lobby where you can do whatever you want without any interference from other players.

The first step in this process is to load up GTA 5 online as you normally would. Once you're in the game, go to the options menu and select "Online." From there, select "Find New Session" and wait until the game has loaded you into a public lobby.

Once you're in the public lobby, open up the Xbox guide menu and navigate to the "Settings" tab. From there, select "Network Settings" and then "Test NAT Type." This will force your Xbox to reconnect to the game's servers, effectively disconnecting you from the current lobby.

Once you've done this, go back to the Xbox guide menu and select "Settings" again, but this time select "All Settings." From there, select "Network" and then "Network Settings." Here, you'll want to select "Go offline" and wait for your Xbox to disconnect from the internet.

Once you're offline, go back to GTA 5 online and wait for the game to kick you out of the lobby. When this happens, go back to the Xbox guide menu and select "Settings" again. This time, select "Network" and then "Network Settings" and select "Go online."

Now that you're online again, go back to GTA 5 online and select "Find New Session" again. This time, the game will load you into a solo public lobby, where you can do whatever you want without any interference from other players.

So there you have it, Xbox players. With this secret hack, you can dominate in solo public lobbies without any hassle. Whether you're just trying to complete some missions or looking to grind out some cash, this hack will make your life a lot easier. Give it a try and see for yourself!

Solo Lobbies have existed for a long time in GTA 5 Online. As of late certain updates have patched a few methods in getting a Solo Lobby. Today I will show you how to get into a Solo Lobby in GTA 5 Online for the Xbox.
 
## How to Get into a Solo Lobby Session in GTA 5 Online for the Xbox
 

 
Getting a Solo Lobby in GTA 5 Online is pretty simple. Although it’s not as simple as how it was before the patch. First thing first, you will need an Ethernet Cable connected to your Xbox. If you have an Xbox I’m sure you have the Ethernet Cable for it. Now here is what you have to do.
 
When you load up GTA 5 Online, go to the Story Mode and open your Network Settings on your Xbox. After that unplug the Ethernet Cable from the back of your Xbox and connect to your Wireless Connection from the Network Settings. Once you are connected to your Wifi you can go back to GTA 5 Online. From there enter into a Public Session. You will enter into a Public Lobby with 25 or fewer people. Now simply plug in your Ethernet Cable back into the Xbox. After a while, the game will kick everyone from that Lobby, and presto you got a Solo Public Lobby all for yourself. Now you can do whatever you want with the Solo Lobby like doing some Cash-based missions or inviting friends over.
 
### How to Create a Solo Lobby Session without an Ethernet Cable
 
If you don’t have an Ethernet Cable it is fine, there is another way you can achieve this but it requires your PC. Go to your PC Settings and find the Network & Internet option. Under that go to Mobile Hotspot and activate it (it should have been off by default), make sure you host a 5 GHz Hotspot. Now connect your Xbox to the Hotspot, now you are ready to make a Solo Public Lobby. While in a Public Lobby, Turn off and on your Hotspot on the PC in quick succession. And as easy as that you have a Solo Public Lobby.
 
This was all about Solo Public Lobbies in GTA 5 Online for the Xbox. Hopefully, this helped you in creating the Solo Public Lobby. You can also check out our guides on Auto Shop Bug Fix and Best RP Servers in GTA 5 Online.
