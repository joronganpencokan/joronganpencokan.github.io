# Unveiling The Secret To Organizing Your Gmail Chaos - Say Goodbye To Email Overload!

Are you tired of sifting through your cluttered Gmail inbox searching for that one important email? Do you often miss important messages due to the chaos in your mailbox? Fear not, for we have the solution to your email overload: Gmail organization.

Gmail is undoubtedly one of the most popular and effective email platforms out there. However, with the sheer volume of emails we receive daily, it can become a daunting task to keep track and maintain our inbox. Fortunately, Gmail offers various features to help manage and organize your emails.

Here, we will be unveiling some of the secrets to organizing your Gmail chaos:

## Labels, Labels, Labels!

Labels are the key to organizing your Gmail inbox. You can add as many labels as possible to categorize your messages according to their importance, relevance, or source. The best part – you can customize your labels to suit your needs, making it easier for you to retrieve your emails.

To add a label to your email, simply select the message and click on the “Labels” drop-down option. If the label you want doesn’t exist, click on “Create new” to add it.

## Filters To The Rescue

Filters are a powerful tool that allows you to automate the process of sorting your emails. You can create filters to forward all emails from a particular sender or automatically archive messages with specific keywords.

To create a filter, click on the little triangle located at the search bar, and from there, you can specify your filter criteria.

## Archive Your Emails

With Gmail, archiving your emails doesn’t mean they are gone forever. Archiving an email merely removes it from your inbox but doesn’t delete it. You can always retrieve your archived messages by searching for them.

Archiving your messages helps to declutter your inbox and reduces the volume of emails you have to sift through.

## Use Multiple Inboxes

Multiple Inboxes is an excellent feature that allows you to combine different categories of emails such as starred emails, drafts, unread emails, and more, all in one place. This feature is an excellent way to keep track and monitor important emails without going through unnecessary clutter.

To enable multiple inbox, go to settings > Inbox, and from there, select the “Multiple Inboxes” tab.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Finally, keyboard shortcuts can help speed up the process of organizing your Gmail inbox. With keyboard shortcuts, you can navigate your inbox, mark emails as read, move to the next message, and many more with just a keystroke.

To enable keyboard shortcuts, go to settings > Keyboard Shortcuts, and select “Keyboard shortcuts on.”

In conclusion, with the help of the above Gmail features, you can now organize your Gmail inbox and bid goodbye to email overload. So, take charge of your mailbox today by utilizing these powerful Gmail tools.

For many of us, Gmail is the fulcrum point connecting our entire online experience. The universal email provider manages our single sign-on (SSO) access, notifies us of important alerts, syncs with team meeting apps, and can easily connect with work domains. Given such versatility, it’s quite common to have multiple Gmail accounts to manage our daily activities.
 
It’s important to know that you don’t have to remember the separate passwords for each Gmail account. There are several ways to access multiple Gmail accounts from one place and check all your email simultaneously.
 
## 1. Using Gmail Sign-in Add Account
 
Gmail has a sign-in “add account” feature which lets you add secondary Gmail accounts to your primary Gmail address. This is undoubtedly the fastest, easiest, and most widely used method to keep all your Gmail addresses in one place. 
 
### On PC/Laptop
 
If you use Gmail mostly on a PC/laptop, you can add new Gmail accounts from your user profile letter on the top right. It’s prominently visible, and adding a secondary Gmail account is quite easy. Click “Add another account” to proceed.
 
A Google sign-in page will appear next. Log in with your secondary Gmail accounts and password to proceed.
 
After you sign in, you can immediately view the newly added Gmail address on your primary Gmail inbox. Every time you click on that region, it will open the secondary inbox in parallel to the main Gmail inbox.
 
### On Mobile/Tablet
 
For Android and iOS smartphone and tablet users, the option to add new email addresses in the Gmail app is the same as the desktop. You may also open Gmail in any mobile browser for more private browsing. 
 
## 2. Through Private Browsing/Incognito Mode
 
Another easy, intuitive method to access multiple Gmail accounts is to go for private or incognito mode browsing. This method is browser-specific, but the core idea is that you can access as many Gmail accounts as you want depending on the number of incognito browser windows open. It’s great for multitaskers!
 
### On Google Chrome
 
To manage multiple Gmail accounts, Google Chrome users can access the incognito mode from the three-dot menu on the top-right corner. 
 
### On Mozilla Firefox
 
Mozilla Firefox has a similar placement for private browsing. Go to the hamburger menu on the top-right corner and open “new private window” to proceed.
 
## 3. Using Multiple Browser Profiles
 
One can create multiple browser profiles to access different Gmail accounts. Again, this method is browser-specific as shown below.
 
### On Microsoft Edge
 
Microsoft Edge users can access additional browser profiles from the “user” icon on the top-right corner. You can either choose to browse as a guest, which will also give you separate Gmail accounts, or click “Add profile” as shown here.
 
You can create as many browser profiles as you need in Edge to access multiple Gmail email accounts in one place.
 
Google Chrome has a more sophisticated environment for multiple browser profiles. Click on your user profile on the top-right corner and go to “Add,” which is depicted by a plus sign. 
 
You can do a lot of customization of your secondary Google Chrome profile, including theme colors, which will mark different Gmail windows separately.
 
The following screen shows access to multiple Gmail accounts based on different browser profiles. 
 
You can also create new email profiles in the Firefox browser, which has far more steps.
 
## 4. In Thunderbird Gmail Settings 
 
If you are using Thunderbird as your primary email account, it’s very easy to add multiple Gmail accounts from the Thunderbird Gmail settings. There is an option to set up an account from “Email” as shown here.
 
After a few steps, you will be greeted by a sign-in page where Gmail account credentials have to be entered. For detailed steps on how to add Gmail to the Thunderbird client, we have an extensive tutorial. 
 
## 5. With Gmail Outlook Settings 
 
Many Windows users have Outlook as a default email client. It, too, supports adding multiple email accounts including Gmail addresses.
 
Go to “Account Settings” from the homepage of the Outlook client. Here you can add a new email address from the prominently visible “New” email category. This will open a new pop-up window where you can enter your Gmail account address.
 
Once you enter the Gmail password, you will notice another pop-up window of Gmail sign-in credentials.
 
In the next screen, you will be able to view a notification that says: “Microsoft Apps and services want to access your Gmail account.” Click OK to proceed.
 
The Gmail account has been added to Outlook. You can access multiple Gmail accounts in one place right here.
 
## 6. On Different Web Browsers
 
Of course, the last and easiest way to access multiple Gmail accounts is to open it separately on different web browsers. The following screen shows Gmail opened across Edge, Chrome, and Firefox. 
 
Having multiple Gmail accounts is a professional necessity today. Here we have covered a number of tested methods which allow you to check multiple Gmail accounts in one place. You can also learn to create your own Gmail desktop app for higher productivity and improve your search tips for faster results.
