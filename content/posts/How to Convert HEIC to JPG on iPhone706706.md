# Unlock the Secret to Converting HEIC to JPG on Your iPhone - Say Goodbye to Incompatibility Issues Forever!

Are you tired of encountering compatibility issues when transferring photos from your iPhone to another device? Do you find yourself frustrated that the files are saved in HEIC format? Well, worry no more as we unearth the secret to converting HEIC to JPG on your iPhone!

Firstly, let's understand what HEIC is.

HEIC (High-Efficiency Image Format) is the default photo format used by Apple since iOS 11. It offers great advantages over JPG, including smaller file sizes with the same level of image quality. Hence, HEIC files reduce storage space on your iPhone while maintaining the quality of the photo.

However, incompatibility issues arise when transferring HEIC photos to other devices or uploading them to websites that don't support the format. In such cases, you need to convert your photos to a widely accepted format like JPG.

Here's how you can convert HEIC to JPG on your iPhone:

1. Go to the Settings app on your iPhone and scroll down to 'Camera.'

2. Tap on 'Formats' and select 'Most Compatible.' This will change the default camera format from HEIC to JPG.

3. If you wish to convert an existing HEIC photo to JPG, you can do so by selecting the photo and tapping on 'Share.'

4. From there, scroll and select 'Save as File,' which will save the image as a JPG.

Alternatively, you can use a third-party app to convert multiple HEIC files to JPG at once. Here are some apps you can use:

1. 'HEIC Converter' - a free app that allows you to convert multiple HEIC files to JPG or PNG format.

2. 'iMazing HEIC Converter' - a popular app that converts HEIC files to JPG, PNG, or PDF format.

In conclusion, converting HEIC photos to JPG is crucial to avoid compatibility issues when transferring or uploading images. With the above methods in mind, you can seamlessly convert HEIC to JPG on your iPhone and say goodbye to incompatibility issues forever!
