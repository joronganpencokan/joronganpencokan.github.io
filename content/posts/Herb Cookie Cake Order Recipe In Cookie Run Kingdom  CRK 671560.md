Are you tired of baking the same old cookies every time you crave something sweet? Look no further! Take a journey with me to the Cookie Run Kingdom, where we will reveal the secret recipe for the delightful Herb Cookie Cake that will satisfy even the most demanding sweet tooth.

Ingredients:

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup milk

Directions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and grease a 8-inch cake pan.

2. In a mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to beat together the softened butter and sugar until fluffy and light in color.

3. Add the beaten egg and mix well.

4. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt.

5. Add the chopped rosemary and thyme leaves to the flour mixture and stir gently, ensuring the herbs are evenly distributed.

6. Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet mixture, stirring slowly to combine.

7. Add the vanilla extract and milk, and beat the batter on low speed, until all ingredients are combined.

8. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center of the cake.

9. Remove from the oven and let the cake cool completely before serving.

The Herb Cookie Cake is best when served chilled, especially on hot summer days. Pair it with a cup of tea or a glass of cold milk for the perfect afternoon snack. The rosemary and thyme bring a unique flavor to the cake, and the texture is light and fluffy, making it a great addition to any dessert menu.
