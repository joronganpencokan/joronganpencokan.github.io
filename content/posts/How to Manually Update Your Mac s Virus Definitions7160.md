Step 3: Download and Install the Updates

After clicking the 'Update' button, the software should start searching for the latest virus definitions. If updates are available, click on the 'Download' or 'Update' button to download and install them.

Step 4: Confirm the Installation

After the download is complete, the software will prompt you to confirm the installation. Follow the instructions to install the updates, and once it's complete, the antivirus software will restart to apply the new virus definitions.
