Revolutionize Your Screen! Unlock the Hidden Trick to Invert Colors on Your iPhone and iPad Now!

As the world becomes more and more reliant on digital technology, it's important to explore all the ways in which we can optimize our experiences. Often, our devices come preloaded with features that we may not even know about. One such feature that could radically change the way you use your iPhone or iPad is the "Invert Colors" option. In this article, we'll explore this hidden trick and uncover its vast potential.

Inverting colors on your device may seem like a small and insignificant change, but its effects can be vast. For one, it can significantly reduce the strain placed on your eyes when using your device for extended periods of time. The bright white backgrounds on most apps can be harsh and jarring, leading to both physical discomfort and an overall sense of unease. Inverting your colors can help to mitigate this issue by softening the overall color palette of your screen.

Further, inverting colors can have a profound impact on those with visual impairments. The high contrast between dark backgrounds and light text can improve legibility for those with certain types of color blindness. Additionally, this trick can make it easier for those with dyslexia to read on their devices by reducing the interference caused by the background.

Enabling this feature on your iPhone or iPad is incredibly easy. Simply go to your device's Settings, then tap General > Accessibility > Display Accommodations > Invert Colors. From there, you can select the option that best suits your needs: Smart Invert, Classic Invert, or Grayscale Invert.

Smart Invert is an intelligent option that aims to preserve color where it's necessary. This option is particularly useful for those who want to invert colors but still retain some color information in their apps. For example, if you're editing a photo, you may want to preserve some color information to get a better idea of how it will look when you are finished.

Classic Invert is the standard option for inverting colors, meaning that all colors are replaced by their complementary colors. For example, white becomes black, blue becomes yellow, and so on. This option is ideal for those who want a more straightforward color inversion.

Grayscale Invert is an option that converts all colors to shades of gray. This option is less striking visually but can be helpful for those with sensitive eyes who want to reduce the amount of visual stimulation on their screens.

As you can see, inverting colors on your iPhone or iPad can have a range of benefits, from reducing strain on your eyes to aiding those with certain visual impairments. By understanding this hidden trick and taking advantage of it, you can radically revolutionize the way you use your device for the better. So what are you waiting for? Get inverted and start experiencing the benefits today!

This article explains how to invert colors on the iPhone and iPad. One method applies to iOS 12 and earlier, and one method applies to iOS 13 and later. The Invert Colors setting differs from both Dark Mode and Night Shift available in recent iPhones and iPads.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- iOS 12 or earlier: Go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Display Accommodations > Invert Color. Tap Smart Invert or Classic Invert.iOS 13 or later: Go to Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size and turn on Smart Invert or Classic Invert.

 
##   How to Invert Colors on the iPhone and iPad  
 

Some people prefer using inverted colors to reduce glare and eye strain. Other people invert colors to help with visual impairments. This could be something as common as color blindness or a more serious condition. iOS offers both Smart Invert, which reverses the colors of the display except for images, media and some other features, and Classic Invert, which reverses all the colors of the display.

 

Here's how to invert colors on your iOS device.

 
###   How to Turn on Invert Colors in iOS 12 and earlier  
 
- Open Settings.
 - Go to General > Accessibility > Display Accommodations.
 - Tap Invert Colors, then choose either Smart Invert or Classic Invert.
 - The screen colors change immediately.

 

To undo the inverted colors setting on an iPhone or iPad and return the colors to their original settings, repeat the steps above. Tap the invert option again to turn the feature off and return the device colors to normal.

 

Open Settings.

 

Go to General > Accessibility > Display Accommodations.

 

Tap Invert Colors, then choose either Smart Invert or Classic Invert.

 

The screen colors change immediately.

 
###   How to Turn On Invert Colors in iOS 13 and Later  
 
- Open Settings.
 - Select Accessibility.
 - Tap Display & Text Size.
 - Turn on Smart Invert.
 - How to Quickly Turn Invert On and Off
 - If you want to use invert colors regularly in iOS 12 and earlier, set up a shortcut. Go to Settings > General > Accessibility and tap Accessibility Shortcut and select either of the invert options. (In iOS 13 and later, the path is Settings > Accessibility > Accessibility Shortcut.)
 - Choose which accessibility features you want (including Smart Invert Colors, Classic Invert Colors, or both) and leave the screen.
 - Now, when you want to invert colors, triple-press the Home button (or the side button on iPhone X and newer) and choose the invert colors option you want to use.
 - Is Invert the Same as Dark Mode?
 - Dark mode is a feature of some operating systems and apps that changes the colors of the user interface from the standard bright colors to darker colors. These dark colors are more appropriate for night use and for avoiding eye strain. Changing the color can be done either manually by the user or automatically based on ambient light or time of day.
 - On older versions of the iOS, there wasn't a true dark mode function for iPhone or iPad. That changed in iOS 13. Read all about it in How to Enable Dark Mode on iPhone and iPad.
 - The macOS also has a dark mode feature. On macOS Mojave or newer, you can turn your Mac's Dark Mode on or off.
 - Are Invert and Night Shift the Same Thing?
 - While both the Invert feature and Night Shift adjust the colors of the iPhone or iPad screen, they don't do it in the same way.
 - Night Shift—a feature available on iOS and Macs—changes the overall tone of the colors on the screen by reducing blue light and making the tone of the screen yellow. This is thought to avoid the disruption of sleep that some people experience from using blue-tinted screens in the dark.
