# Unlock the Secret to Superior Data Analysis: Master the Art of Box and Whisker Plots in Excel Today!

When it comes to data analysis, one of the most useful tools is the box and whisker plot. This powerful graphical technique is used to display the spread and variability of a dataset, making it easy to identify outliers and other important features. In this article, we'll explore what box and whisker plots are, how they work, and how to create them in Excel.

## What Are Box and Whisker Plots?

A box and whisker plot (also known as a box plot) is a graphical representation of a dataset that shows the distribution of values. The plot is typically divided into four quartiles or segments, each of which represents 25% of the data. The median (or middle value) is shown as a horizontal line within the box. The lower and upper "whiskers" represent the minimum and maximum values within the dataset, excluding any outliers.

Box and whisker plots are useful for identifying patterns and outliers within a dataset. They are often used in statistical analysis to compare the distribution of data between different groups or to visualize changes over time.

## How Do Box and Whisker Plots Work?

Box and whisker plots work by dividing a dataset into quartiles, which represent the division of the dataset into four equal parts. The "box" in the plot represents the second and third quartiles, which contain 50% of the data. The "whiskers" represent the first and fourth quartiles, which contain the remaining 50% of the data. The whiskers extend from the top and bottom of the box to the minimum and maximum values (excluding outliers).

Outliers are values that fall outside the range of the whiskers. Outliers can be represented as individual points on the plot, or as asterisks or other symbols. The presence of outliers can be an indication of a skewed dataset or errors in measurement.

## How to Create Box and Whisker Plots in Excel

Excel provides a straightforward tool for creating box and whisker plots. Follow these simple steps to create your own:

1. Enter your data into a worksheet in Excel.
2. Select the range of data that you want to use in your box and whisker plot.
3. Click on "Insert" in the Excel ribbon.
4. Click on "Statistical Charts" in the Charts group.
5. Select "Box and Whisker" from the dropdown menu.
6. Excel will create a new chart with your data in a default format.
7. You can customize the chart by changing the colors, labels, and other design elements.

## Conclusion

Box and whisker plots are an essential tool for data analysts who want to gain deeper insights into their datasets. By visualizing the distribution of values, box and whisker plots make it easy to identify patterns, outliers, and other important features. And with Excel's built-in tools, creating box and whisker plots is easier than ever. So if you want to take your data analysis to the next level, start mastering the art of box and whisker plots today!

In Microsoft Excel, a box plot uses graphics to display groups of numerical data through five values, called quartiles. Box plot charts can be dressed up with whiskers, which are vertical lines extending from the chart boxes. The whiskers indicate variability outside the upper and lower quartiles.

 

Box and whisker plots are typically used to depict information from related data sets than have independent sources, such as test scores between different schools or data from before and after changes in a process or procedure. 

 

In recent versions of Excel, you can create a box and whisker chart using the Insert Chart tool. Although older versions of Excel don't have a box and whisker plot maker, you can create one by converting a stacked column chart into a box plot and then adding the whiskers.

 
##   Use Excel's Box and Whisker Plot Maker  
 

For Excel 2019, Excel 2016, or Excel for Microsoft 365, make a box and whisker plot chart using the Insert Chart tool.

 
These instructions apply to Excel 2019, Excel 2016, Excel for Microsoft 365, Excel 2013, and Excel 2010.
 
- Enter the data you want to use to create a box and whisker chart into columns and rows on the worksheet. This can be a single data series or multiple data series.
 - Select the data you want to use to make the chart.
 - Select the Insert tab.
 - Select Recommended Charts in the Charts group (or select the dialog box launcher in the lower-right corner of the charts group) to open the Insert Chart dialog box.
 - Select the All Charts tab in the Insert Chart dialog box.
 - Select Box and Whisker and choose OK. A basic box and whisker plot chart appears on the worksheet.

 
##   Transform a Box Plot Chart into a Box and Whisker Plot  
 

For Excel 2013 or Excel 2010, start with a stacked column chart and transform it into a box and whisker plot chart.

 

Enter the data you want to use to create a box and whisker chart into columns and rows on the worksheet. This can be a single data series or multiple data series.

 

Select the data you want to use to make the chart.

 

Select the Insert tab.

 

Select Recommended Charts in the Charts group (or select the dialog box launcher in the lower-right corner of the charts group) to open the Insert Chart dialog box.

 

Select the All Charts tab in the Insert Chart dialog box.

 

Select Box and Whisker and choose OK. A basic box and whisker plot chart appears on the worksheet.

 

Create a basic box plot chart in Excel and then add the whiskers.

 
###   Add the Top Whisker  
 

The whiskers on a box and whisker box plot chart indicate variability outside the upper and lower quartiles. Any data point that falls outside the top or bottom whisker line would be considered an outlier when analyzing the data.

 
- Select the top box on the chart and then select Add Chart Element on the Chart Design tab.
 - Select Error Bars and choose More Error Bar Options to open the Format Error Bars menu.
 - Select Plus under Direction in Error Bars Options.
 - Select Custom and choose Specify Value in the Error Amount Section to open the Custom Error Bars dialog box .

 
###   Add the Bottom Whisker  
 

Once you've added the top whiskers, then you can add the bottom whiskers in a similar fashion.

 

Select the top box on the chart and then select Add Chart Element on the Chart Design tab.

 

Select Error Bars and choose More Error Bar Options to open the Format Error Bars menu.

 

Select Plus under Direction in Error Bars Options.

 

Select Custom and choose Specify Value in the Error Amount Section to open the Custom Error Bars dialog box .

 
- Select the bottom box on the chart and select Add Chart Element on the Chart Design tab.
 - Select Error Bars and choose More Error Bar Options to open the Format Error Bars menu.
 - Select Minus under Direction in Error Bars Options.
 - Select Custom and choose Specify Value in the Error Amount Section. The Custom Error Bars dialog box will open.
 - Delete the contents of the Positive Error Value box. Select the bottom values on the worksheet and select OK to close the Custom Error Bars window.

 
##   Format a Box and Whisker Plot Chart in Excel  
 

Once you have created the chart, use Excel's chart formatting tools.

 

Select the bottom box on the chart and select Add Chart Element on the Chart Design tab.

 

Select Minus under Direction in Error Bars Options.

 

Select Custom and choose Specify Value in the Error Amount Section. The Custom Error Bars dialog box will open.

 - Select a method for Quartile Calculation:
 - Inclusive Median is included in the calculation if the number of values in the data is odd.Exclusive median is excluded from the calculation if there are an odd number of values in the data.
 - Select the next box in your plot chart to customize it in the Format Data Series pane and repeat for any remaining boxes.
