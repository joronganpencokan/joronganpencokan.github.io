This deadly rifle is the ultimate assassin weapon, capable of delivering deadly accuracy and stealthy lethality to any target. But unlocking this coveted weapon can be a challenge - which is why we've put together this guide to help you get your hands on it!

## Step One: Assassinate Five Elusive Targets

The first step towards unlocking the Silent Sniper is to take down five of Hitman 3's elusive targets. These targets appear periodically on the game's maps and offer challenging, high-stakes assassination opportunities.

Once you've taken down five elusive targets, you'll unlock the first step towards the Silent Sniper.

## Step Two: Complete the Dartmoor Mission

After taking down five elusive targets, your next task is to complete the Dartmoor mission in Hitman 3. This mission takes place in a sprawling English estate, and you'll need to use all of your assassin skills to infiltrate the target's mansion and take them out. If you're able to complete this mission successfully, you'll unlock the second step towards the Silent Sniper.

## Step Three: Eliminate the Last Three Eskalations

The final step towards unlocking the Silent Sniper is to eliminate the last three Eskalations in Hitman 3. Eskalations are a series of escalating assassination scenarios that take place on the game's various maps. They start off fairly simple, but gradually become more complex and challenging as you progress. To unlock the Silent Sniper, you'll need to successfully eliminate the last three Eskalations - a task that will test your skills as an assassin like never before.

## Unlocking the Silent Sniper

Once you've completed all three steps, you'll have unlocked the ultimate assassin weapon in Hitman 3 - the Silent Sniper. This deadly rifle is capable of delivering pinpoint accuracy and devastating lethality to any target, making it the perfect weapon for any would-be assassin. So if you're looking to take your Hitman 3 game to the next level, be sure to follow these steps to unlock the Silent Sniper and unleash its deadly power on your targets.
