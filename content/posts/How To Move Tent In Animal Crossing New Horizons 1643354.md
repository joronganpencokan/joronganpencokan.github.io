Tents are your permanent settlement in Animal Crossing New Horizons. If you are starting out and want to know about the best tent location then this guide is for you. You will also learn how to move a tent, can you customize tent color, etc. Tent location in Animal Crossing New Horizons is important for some reasons, like time to reach Resident Services or if you are playing online then staying near the airport will help you a lot. So let’s begin with the guide on how to move a tent in Animal Crossing New Horizons.
 
## Which is the best place to set up a Tent in Animal Crossing New Horizons?
 
There are two spots to place tents in the game. The first is near Resident Services and the second is near the Airport. Both rely on your requirements, for example, if you had just started and going to explore the game a lot then place your tent near Resident Services. You will be visiting this place to earn money, by selling items, furniture, also it is your shop to buy new equipment, etc.
 
When you place your tent near Resident Services in Animal Crossing New Horizons you will be saving a lot of time. Whenever you have something to sell you can instantly visit Resident Services and unlock the money. In a similar way, you can buy new equipment for new activities. So pick a location near Resident Services as your starting point.
 
The second best spot is near the Airport. This is good for those who are going to play this game online. Because you will be moving to new spots, and after visiting a friend’s island you can instantly return to your home and organize your inventory.
 
With your tent, you can select the position of two villagers at the start. Place them near to your tent but a little far from Resident Services. Because that place will be later on utilized for Museum or Shop. If you place the villagers then other important buildings will be moved far. It is good to start thinking about placement from the start. A best practice is to put your tent near to all the important buildings and other villagers at a decent distance, to meet and greet them.
 
After setting up your Tent, meet Tom Nook who will ask you to help the other two villages. Meet them and you will have the following three options.
 
- This looks Good – If you choose this option tent will be placed right on the spot.
 - I’ll find you a spot – You will get the tent as an item and you can place it to a spot of your choice.
 - Maybe reconsider? – You deny helping the villagers, so you get nothing. Talk to them again.
