Firstly, make sure you have all the necessary materials. You'll need five wood, two iron, and four stone to craft a stone cutter. Once you have everything, head over to your workbench and select the crafting tab.

Now, here's the trick. Instead of selecting the stone cutter from the crafting menu, scroll down until you find the "miscellaneous" tab. Click on it, and you'll see the stone cutter there. By selecting it from the miscellaneous tab, you'll be able to craft the stonecutter faster and with less chance of accidentally skipping it over.

Once you've crafted your stone cutter, it's time to put it to use. The stone cutter can be used to cut stone into various shapes and sizes, making it a valuable tool for building structures and fortifications.

One important thing to note is that the stone cutter cannot be used to cut metal. So, if you're looking to build a sword or armor, you'll need a different tool for that.

In conclusion, by using this one trick of selecting the stone cutter from the miscellaneous tab, you'll be able to craft one like a pro in no time. Good luck on your Valheim journey!
