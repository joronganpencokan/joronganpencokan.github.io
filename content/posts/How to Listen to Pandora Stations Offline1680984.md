##   Tips for Using Pandora in Offline Mode  
 

Connect your Android device, iPad, or iPhone to Wi-Fi before you sync stations. You can download music over a cellular data connection rather than Wi-Fi, but you'll use a lot of data to get everything downloaded. If you have the option to connect to a wireless network, you should do it. You'll save time because Wi-Fi is typically faster than cellular data. You'll save money, too, because you won't go over the data limit of your cellular data plan.

 
If your device drops its Wi-Fi connection in the middle of downloading a song, Pandora saves where you were in the download, then resumes downloading when you're connected to the internet again.
 

The real benefit of Pandora in Offline Mode is that you have the freedom to listen to music even when you can't connect to the internet. Whether you're on an airplane, in an office basement, on a road trip, or running on the trail, Pandora saves the day by giving you the tunes you love without consuming data.

 
If you put Pandora in Offline Mode manually, regardless of whether your mobile device is connected to the internet over Wi-Fi or cellular, you'll enjoy your music without using any network bandwidth at all.
