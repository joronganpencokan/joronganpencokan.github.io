# Revolutionize Your Discord Experience in 2023: Learn How to Make It Play Through Your Speakers!

Discord is a popular platform used by millions of people around the world to communicate and share their thoughts and ideas with their friends, family, and colleagues. It has become a vital tool for the gaming community, providing an easy and convenient way to connect with others while playing games together. However, there is one feature that has been missing from Discord that could take it to the next level: the ability to play through your speakers. 

Fortunately, this feature is now available, and in this article, we’ll take a look at how to revolutionize your Discord experience in 2023 by utilizing it. 

## What is Playing Through Your Speakers?

Playing through your speakers is the process of routing audio from your computer or device to your speakers. This means that any sound that your computer can make, including the sounds from Discord, can be heard through your speakers instead of your computer's internal speakers or headphones. 

## Why is Playing Through Your Speakers Important in Discord?

Playing through your speakers can greatly enhance your Discord experience. It allows you to hear the sounds from the game you are playing and the voices of your fellow gamers through your speakers, which can provide a more immersive experience. 

Additionally, playing through your speakers can also help to reduce fatigue and prevent hearing damage. Wearing headphones for extended periods of time can cause discomfort, ear fatigue, and even hearing loss. By playing through your speakers, you can avoid these issues without sacrificing sound quality. 

## How to Make Discord Play Through Your Speakers

Making Discord play through your speakers is easy, and can be done in just a few simple steps. Here’s how to do it: 

1. Open Discord and go to the Voice & Video settings. 

2. Under the Input Device dropdown menu, select your microphone. 

3. Under the Output Device dropdown menu, select your speakers. 

4. Adjust the volume levels as desired. 

5. Test your setup by joining a voice chat and playing some audio. 

Congratulations! You have successfully revolutionized your Discord experience in 2023 by making it play through your speakers. 

## Conclusion

Playing through your speakers is a simple yet powerful way to revolutionize your Discord experience in 2023. It can provide a more immersive experience, reduce fatigue and hearing damage, and make gaming with friends more enjoyable. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily make this feature a part of your Discord experience. 

So, what are you waiting for? Start playing through your speakers today and take your Discord experience to the next level!

## Where is the Discord Speaker Button? Has it Been Removed?
 

 
On 22 January 2022, many users are reporting that the speaker button on mobile has been removed. It seems to be a bug because Discord has replied that the Speaker Mode is still available on mobile and if you are running into issues, you can submit a ticket to the support team using this link. The team will investigate the issue.
 
 
 
Apart from the Speaker button, there’s also a mobile screen sharing option with which you can share your screen directly from your phone, wherever you are! It is present in the same pop-up as the Speaker button and indicated by the icon that has a Mobile with an arrow popping out of it. You can stop sharing by tapping on the Stop Sharing button directly or by pressing the Stop Streaming button in your notification panel.
 
Apart from this, there’s also a Mobile Voice overlay option where you can see who’s talking and access shortcuts while using other apps. You don’t need to switch back to Discord again which is pretty helpful! All you have to do is head to User Settings > Voice & Video and find the Overlay section. Here, toggle the Enable Mobile Voice Overlay option on and that’s pretty much everything you have to do.
