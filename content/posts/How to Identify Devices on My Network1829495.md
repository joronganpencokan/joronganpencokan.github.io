STOP! Your neighbors might be stealing your internet! Learn how to identify devices on your network NOW!

In a world where internet connectivity is a must-have, it's easy to overlook the fact that your internet connection can be easily accessed by your next-door neighbors. Did you know that your neighbor can easily tap into your wireless network and use your internet without your permission? If you're not monitoring your network, your data could be at risk. 

Your internet is like a highway; it allows data to travel back and forth between different devices. Your router (the device that allows you to connect to the internet) broadcasts this data wirelessly, which means that anyone within range can access it if they know how. This is bad news if you're not securing your network. 

Luckily, there are ways to identify devices on your network and keep your internet connection secure. Here's how: 

1. Access your router settings: Most routers will allow you to log in through a web browser using a specific IP address (usually 192.168.x.x). Once you're logged in, you can access your router settings, which will allow you to see which devices are connected to your network. 

2. Check the device list: Most routers will display a list of connected devices in either the main dashboard or in the settings menu. This list should display the names and MAC addresses of devices connected to your network. If you see any unfamiliar devices, there's a good chance that someone else is using your internet. 

3. Consider checking your internet speed: If you notice that your internet connection is slow, it's a good idea to check your internet speed using a speed test tool. Slower speeds can indicate that someone else is using your internet, which will slow down your connection speed. 

4. Secure your network: Once you've identified any unauthorized devices, it's important to secure your network. You can do this by changing your wireless password and disabling remote access to your router. This will prevent anyone from accessing your network without your permission. 

In conclusion, it's important to understand that your internet connection is not immune to hacking attempts. Your neighbors might be stealing your internet, so it's important to monitor your network and stay vigilant. By checking your connected device list and securing your network, you can help protect your data and ensure that you're the only one who has access to your internet connection. Don't let someone else mooch off of your data plan. Protect your internet connection today!

This article explains how to identify devices on your home internet network. There are many ways, spread across various devices and apps, to find out what's connected to your network. The method below is the most straightforward and doesn't require any extra software.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Enter your default gateway IP address into the web browser of your choice. Sign in, and look for a list of connected devices.Most routers will display a list of devices connected, but this page won't be in the same place for all routers.

 
##   How Can I See All the Device Connected to My Network?  
 

Regardless of what devices you use or have access to, if you have the internet at home and can access a web browser, you can easily find out what's connected to your network. Before you can get going, you'll want to make sure you have your router's login information at hand.

 

If that doesn't already sound familiar to you, chances are your login info is set to default. It's usually a combination of "username" for the username field and "password" for the password field, but this does change depending on your router, so make sure you have the correct info.

 
- Find your default gateway IP address. It's your router's IP address (like http://192.168.1.1)you can use to enter into a web browser like a URL to access your router's web-management setup.
 - Open up any web browser on a mobile device or a computer; type in your default gateway IP address, and press Enter. It may take a few seconds to load.
 - Once you're at your router's web management portal, you'll need to log in. Either use your router's default login info, if you haven't changed it from default, or enter in your username and password.
 - Every router will handle its settings and set up pages differently, but a core feature of these pages is the ability to check what's connected to your network.
 - Navigate around and look for this list. Sometimes, routers will split up lists of connections by connection type, so if you have wired devices and WiFi devices, make sure you look for the suitable device type.
 - Once you find your device list, don't be alarmed if you don't recognize the name of every device connected to your network. Some devices of your devices will have identifiable names, but others may come up as unknown or be named a random string of letters and numbers. Make sure to take a count of your internet-enabled devices to compare with the list you find.

 
If you haven't already, make sure to change your router's password so no one can make changes to your settings. The router's password is different than the password used to log onto the Wi-Fi signal.

Open your router's mobile app and look for a tab that lists all the devices connected to your network. It might say Devices or Device Manager. If your router doesn't come with a companion app, try a free Wi-Fi analyzer app to monitor connected devices and the security of your network.
 
Use the ping command to reach a device on a local network and find its MAC address. You can also search a particular device's settings for its MAC and local IP addresses and cross-reference this information in your router's control panel. Learn more about using an IP address to find a MAC address.
