In this post, we show you how to install the Google Roboto font on Windows, macOS, Linux, and even on your website. Let’s get started!
 
## Downloading the Google Roboto Font
 
Regardless of your platform, you first need to download the Roboto font pack. To do this, head to the Roboto font site. The simplest way to download the entire font family is to click the “Download Family” button.
 
It will end up as a ZIP file on your computer, at which point you’ll be able to install it on your Operating System (OS).
 
## How to Install Google Roboto Font on Windows, Mac and Linux
 
The great news is that regardless of which platform you want to install the Roboto font on, it’ll take a matter of clicks.
 
### 1. Windows 10
 
For Windows, first unzip the Roboto font folder. Next, head to the Start Menu and open the Settings page.
 
From here, click the Personlization option, then Fonts.
 
Next, drag the extracted fonts onto the installer window. After a few seconds, the Google Roboto font will be installed within Windows. You can select it as you would any other font from within your installed applications.
 
### 2. macOS
 
For Mac, first extract the ZIP file, then select all of the fonts inside the folder (skipping over LICENSE.txt), right-click, and select “Open With -> Font Book” from the context menu.
 
This will load them into Font Book and will make them available for use in your applications.
 
Note that you can also double-click the individual font files to load them into Font Book.
 
### 3. Linux
 
Open your home folder and enable the option to view hidden files/folders. Locate the “.fonts” folder. If it doesn’t exist, create it. Next, move the Roboto font folder to this “.fonts” folder.
 
Alternatively, you can make use of the Font Manager program to manage your fonts.

Go to the FontSquirrel Roboto font page, click “Webfont Kit,” then choose your preferred font formats, a subset (if any) and click “Download @Font-Face Kit.”
 
Extract the zipped file to your website font folder. Open your web stylesheet and add the following code:

Next, you can use the syntax font-family:"Roboto"; to display the Roboto font on your web page.
