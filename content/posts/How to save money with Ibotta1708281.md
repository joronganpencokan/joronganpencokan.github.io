## Money-saving features from ibotta


The ibotta app has several money-saving features, let’s look at the highlights:
Any brand rebates: This is probably the most convenient way to earn cash back with the Ibotta app. This feature allows you to potentially earn money on store or generic brands of products you typically buy. To use this feature, just type “any brand” into the search bar and separate the brand offers from the others.
Use the scanner in-store: Let’s face it, more often than not when we are in the grocery store we are usually in a bit of a hurry. If you want to consistently use the Ibotta app to earn some extra money, be sure to take advantage of the app’s barcode scanner. The scanner helps you determine if the item you’re purchasing will earn you cash back.

Always upload your receipts promptly: Now, this isn’t a feature per se but more of a tip. When using the Ibotta app you must upload your store receipt right away. Upon uploading a photo of your receipt you will unlock rebates. The rebates have an expiration date, so the sooner you upload it the better!
Tell your friends: If you refer a friend to ibotta and they create an account and claim their welcome bonus, you get rewarded as well. Ibotta does assign you a referral code that you can share on both Twitter and Facebook, so spreading the word to family and friends is super easy.
