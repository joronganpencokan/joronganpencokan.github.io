# You'll Never Believe How Google Keyboard Just Revolutionized Your Texting Game - One Handed Typing Made Effortless!

Imagine being able to send a text message with just one hand, without having to awkwardly stretch your fingers across your phone screen. Thanks to Google Keyboard's latest update, it's now possible to do just that. One-handed typing has just been made effortless with the Google Keyboard app, and you won't believe how much of a difference it can make to your texting game.

Google Keyboard is a popular alternative to the standard keyboard on Android devices, and it's packed with features to make typing quicker and easier. Its latest update has taken things to the next level, by introducing a one-handed mode that allows you to type with just one hand, whether you're left or right-handed.

To activate one-handed mode, simply long-press on the comma key in the bottom left or right corner of the keyboard. This will bring up a pop-up menu where you can select the one-handed mode you prefer. You can choose from either the right-hand or left-hand mode, depending on which hand you prefer to use.

Once you've selected your one-handed mode, the keyboard will shift to the side of the screen, bringing all the keys closer to your thumb or finger. If you're using the left-handed mode, the keyboard will shift to the left side of the screen, making it easy to reach all the keys with your left thumb. If you're using the right-handed mode, the keyboard will shift to the right side of the screen, making it easy to reach all the keys with your right thumb or finger.

The one-handed mode also comes with a range of other features to make typing even easier. There's a dedicated row of number and symbol keys, so you don't have to switch to a different keyboard to enter numbers or punctuation. You can also swipe up on the keyboard to access the full range of emojis and other special characters.

Google Keyboard's one-handed mode is a game-changer for anyone who finds it difficult to type with two hands, whether due to a small screen or a disability. It's incredibly user-friendly and intuitive to use, and it's sure to make texting faster and easier than ever before.

If you haven't tried Google Keyboard's one-handed mode yet, you're missing out on a game-changing feature that will change the way you think about texting. Give it a try today, and see how much of a difference it can make to your texting game. You won't believe how easy it is to type with just one hand!

Google is releasing a new update for Google Keyboard on Android devices. This is version 5.0 of the keyboard and includes a one-handed mode to make it easier to type with your thumb.
 
However, Google Keyboard is not near as modern and amazing as the Microsoft’s Word Flow Keyboard for iPhone that also offers a one-handed mode, but with its unique “arc” design for an even easier reach of the keys.
 
The company is rolling out the update slowly and it’ll reach out everyone through the Google Play Store. If you can’t wait for the update to arrive, you can download the APK from APKMorrior.com.
 
Once the update downloads on your phone, you simply press and hold the “,” key to bring up the options and tap the one-handed icon next to the gear icon on the left. Then Google Keyboard will reduce in size and you can easily position it to the left or right by typing the arrow.
 
Alongside the new one-handed mode Google Keyboard brings a few extra features, such adjustable keyboard height, quicker access to emoji and the number pad, and gesture controls like delete words by swiping left from delete key, and control cursor with left and right swipe with the space bar.
