# You've Been Using Excel Wrong! Unlock the Secret Trick to Mastering Worksheet Tabs with Ease

Have you ever opened an Excel file with multiple sheets and felt overwhelmed by the number of tabs? Have you struggled to keep track of which sheet you are on and which one you need to go to? Fear not! By the end of this article, you will learn a secret trick to mastering worksheet tabs with ease.

First, let's review a basic understanding of worksheet tabs. A worksheet is a single page of the Excel file that contains rows and columns for data input. Within one Excel file, there can be multiple worksheets or tabs, each with a unique name and data input. To switch between tabs, you can either click on the tab name at the bottom of the screen or use the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + PgUp" or "Ctrl + PgDn."

Now, let's dive into the secret trick to mastering worksheet tabs: renaming them. This may seem like a small and insignificant task, but it can make a huge difference in your efficiency and organization within Excel.

To rename a worksheet tab, right-click on the tab name and select "Rename." Type in a new name for the tab and press enter. It's that simple! By renaming the worksheet tabs, you can easily identify which sheet you are on and what data is contained within it.

Here are a few tips for renaming worksheet tabs to optimize your experience in Excel:

1. Keep names short and descriptive: Use concise, descriptive names for worksheet tabs to easily identify them at a glance. For example, instead of "Sheet1," rename it to "Sales Data" or "Inventory Management."

2. Use consistent naming conventions: Use a consistent naming convention throughout all worksheet tabs in a file. This will make it easier to maintain organization and ensure that all tabs are easily identifiable.

3. Order your tabs strategically: Arrange your tabs in a logical order that makes sense for your data input and analysis needs. This could be alphabetical, chronological, or even by color-coding to group similar data together.

By renaming worksheet tabs and following these tips, you can easily navigate between multiple sheets with ease, saving you time and preventing confusion. Plus, it makes it much easier for others to read and understand your Excel files if they are well-organized.

In conclusion, mastering worksheet tabs in Excel may seem like a small task, but it can greatly improve your efficiency and organization within the program. By renaming tabs and following a few simple tips, you can easily navigate between worksheets and keep your data input and analysis on track. Give it a try and see how it improves your Excel experience!

This article explains how to navigate Excel quickly between worksheet tabs and around large worksheets using various shortcuts and cell references. Some methods—such as the Go To command—can be accessed using keyboard shortcut key combinations. These instructions should work for all versions of Excel for Windows. Any minor differences between versions are called out in the steps.

 
### 
What To Know
 
- Option 1: Move one sheet left = Ctrl+PgUp (page up) and move one sheet right = Ctrl+PgDn (page down)Option 2: Home tab > Find & Select under Editing. Pick Go to... and enter the cell under Reference. Press Enter.Option 3: Select the Name Box above Column A. Type the cell reference to jump to, and press Enter.

 
##   Use Shortcut Keys to Change Worksheets in Excel  
 

Switching between worksheets in an Excel workbook is done easily enough by clicking on the tabs at the bottom of the worksheets, but it is the slow way of doing it — at least it is in the opinion of those who prefer to use keyboard shortcuts or shortcut keys whenever possible.

 
- To move to the right, press and hold down the Ctrl key on the keyboard.
 - Press and release the PgDn key on the keyboard.
 - To move another sheet to the right press and release the PgDn key a second time.
 - Worksheet tabs are located at the bottom-left of the Excel window.
 - To move to the left, press and hold down the Ctrl key on the keyboard.
 - Press and release the PgUp key on the keyboard.
 - To move another sheet to the left press and release the PgUp key a second time.

 
##   Using 'Go To' to Move Around Excel Worksheets  
 

The Go To command in Excel can be used to quickly navigate to different spreadsheet cells in a worksheet. Although using Go To is not that useful for worksheets containing only a few columns and rows, for larger worksheets it is another way of jumping from one area of your worksheet to another.

 

To move to the right, press and hold down the Ctrl key on the keyboard.

 

Press and release the PgDn key on the keyboard.

 

To move another sheet to the right press and release the PgDn key a second time.

 

To move to the left, press and hold down the Ctrl key on the keyboard.

 

Press and release the PgUp key on the keyboard.

 

To move another sheet to the left press and release the PgUp key a second time.

 
- Select the Home tab at the top of Excel. If you don't see it, select the Edit menu.
 - Choose Find & Select from the Editing group. Or, if you used the Edit menu, choose Find.
 - Choose the Go To... option.
 - Type in the destination cell reference in the Reference line at the bottom of the dialog box.
 - Click OK or press the Enter key on the keyboard. The result is that the active cell highlight jumps to the cell reference that was entered in the dialog box.

 
##   Other Ways to 'Go To'  
 

The Go To command can also be activated with these keyboard shortcuts:

 

Select the Home tab at the top of Excel. If you don't see it, select the Edit menu.

 

Choose Find & Select from the Editing group. Or, if you used the Edit menu, choose Find.

 

Choose the Go To... option.

 

Type in the destination cell reference in the Reference line at the bottom of the dialog box.

 

Click OK or press the Enter key on the keyboard. The result is that the active cell highlight jumps to the cell reference that was entered in the dialog box.

 
- By pressing the F5 key on the keyboard.By pressing the Ctrl+G keys in combination on the keyboard.

 
##   Storing Cell References for Reuse  
 

An additional feature that Go To has is that it stores previously entered cell references in the large Go To window at the top of the dialog box for later reference. If you are jumping back and forth between two or more areas of a worksheet, Go To can save you even more time by reusing the cell references stored in the dialog box.

 
##   Navigating Between Worksheets With 'Go To'  
 

Go To can also be used to navigate to different worksheets in the same workbook by entering the sheet name along with the cell reference.

 
Cell references are stored in the dialog box as long as a workbook remains open. Once it is closed, the stored list of cell references in the Go To dialog box is deleted.
 

Use the exclamation point (!), located above the number 1 on the keyboard, as a separator between the worksheet name and the cell reference because spaces are not permitted.

 

For example, to move from Sheet 1 to cell HQ567 on Sheet 3, enter Sheet3!HQ567 in the reference line of the Go To dialog box and press the Enter key. If the sheet name has one or more spaces, use quotes, like this: 'My Other Sheet'!B12 to move between worksheets.

 
##   Using the Name Box to Move Around Excel Worksheets  
 

The Name Box is located above column A in an Excel worksheet and it can be used to navigate to different areas of that worksheet using cell references.

 

As with the Go To command, the Name Box might not be helpful in worksheets that contain only a few columns and rows of data, but for larger worksheets, or for those with separate data areas using the Name Box to easily jump from one location to the next can be a very efficient way to work.

 
##   The Active Cell Reference in the Name Box  
 

Typically, the Name Box displays the cell reference or named range for the current or active cell — the cell in the current worksheet that is outlined by a border or box.

 
Unfortunately, there is no way to access the Name Box using the keyboard without creating a VBA macro. Normal operation requires clicking on the Name Box with the mouse.
 

Entering a new cell reference or range name in the Name Box and pressing the Enter key changes the active cell and shifts the black box, and what is visible on the screen, to the new location.

 
- Click on the Name Box above column A to highlight the cell reference of the active cell.
 - Type in the cell reference of the desired destination.
 - Press the Enter key on the keyboard.
 - The black box that surrounds the active cell should jump to the newly selected active cell.

 
##   Navigating Between Worksheets With the Name Box  
 

Like Go To, the Name Box can also be used to navigate to different worksheets in the same workbook by entering the sheet name along with the cell reference.

 

Click on the Name Box above column A to highlight the cell reference of the active cell.

 

Type in the cell reference of the desired destination.

 

Press the Enter key on the keyboard.

 

The black box that surrounds the active cell should jump to the newly selected active cell.
