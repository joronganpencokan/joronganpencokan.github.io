Google has released a nifty little app to allow users remote control their PCs using an Android smartphone or tablet. The app is called “Chrome Remote Desktop” app for Android and it’s a new extension that works in combination with the previously released Chrome Remote Desktop for the desktop version of the browser, which is another app that enables you to share your computer’s screen with other person using Chrome.
 
Making everything work in harmony is pretty simple, you’ll first have to install the Chrome Remote Desktop app in the source computer you want to remote access. You can install this app on any major release of Windows (Windows 8.1 included, of course), Mac OS X 10.6 and later, and Linux.
 
Once everything is set up, simply download the new Chrome Remote Desktop app for Android from Google Play, and then you’ll be able to connect remotely to your PC, Mac, or Linux computer.
 
Although, this is a great app for those mobile users who need access to files and programs on the go, let’s not forget that Windows users can download the “Microsoft Remote Desktop” app on Android and Windows Phone to get the same functionality.
