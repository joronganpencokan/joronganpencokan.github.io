# Unlock the Secret to Organizing your Browser Bookmarks on Ubuntu with this Surprising Command Line Trick!


Have you ever found yourself lost amidst the heaps of bookmarks saved on your browser? It's common to collect a large number of bookmarks over time, which can quickly become overwhelming. Finding a specific bookmark can be time-consuming, and organizing them can be a daunting task. However, there's a secret trick that can help you organize your browser bookmarks on Ubuntu with ease – using the command line!


## Why Use the Command Line to Organize Bookmarks?

Organizing bookmarks in the browser can be tedious work, especially when there are a large number of them. While there are several bookmark management tools available, it can be overwhelming to choose from the many options, go through the installation process, and learn the configuration.

Using command line for bookmark management is an efficient and lightweight way to manage your bookmarks without the need for a tool or software. It's also quick if you're already familiar with using command line in Ubuntu or Linux.


## The Secret Trick: Bookmarks in Text Files

The secret to organizing bookmarks using the command line is to store them in text files. This method is incredibly simple, but also highly effective. By saving bookmarks to text files, you can search, sort, and organize them using common text manipulation tools like "grep," "awk," "sed," etc. Plus, you can use any text editor of your choice, including the command line editor "nano," which makes it more flexible.

Let's explore how to implement this method step-by-step.


## Step-by-Step Guide to Organizing Bookmarks with Command Line

### Step 1: Create a Directory to Store Bookmarks

Before we begin, we must first create a directory to store our bookmarks. To do this, open the Terminal and enter the following command:

```mkdir ~/bookmarks```

This command creates a new directory called "bookmarks" in your home directory (represented by the "~" symbol).

### Step 2: Save Your Bookmarks

To save bookmarks to this new directory, we can use any text editor of our choice, but for this example, we'll use "nano." Enter the following command in the Terminal to start nano:

```nano ~/bookmarks/google.txt```

This command creates a new text file called "google.txt" within our "bookmarks" directory, and opens it up in nano, ready to edit.

Next, copy and paste the link of the webpage you want to save into this file, and save it by pressing "Ctrl+X," then "Y," and then "Enter."

You can repeat this process for every bookmark you want to save, and create multiple text files as necessary.

### Step 3: Search and Organize Bookmarks

Now that our bookmarks are saved in text files, we can search, sort, and process them using command line tools like "grep," "awk," or "sed."

For example, if we want to search for all bookmarks related to "ubuntu," we can enter the following command:

```grep -ir "ubuntu" ~/bookmarks```

This command looks for the keyword "ubuntu" in all files under the "bookmarks" directory and returns the matching lines.

Similarly, you can create your own custom scripts or commands that use these files to process and organize your bookmarks in any way you want.

### Step 4: Use Bookmarks in the Browser

Finally, we can use these bookmarks in our browser as well. Most web browsers allow you to import bookmarks from HTML files. To do this, open the browser, click on "Bookmarks," and then "Import Bookmarks." Select "From HTML file" and choose the relevant file(s) from your "bookmarks" directory.

Voila! Your bookmarks are now organized and usable in your browser.


## Wrapping Up

Using the command line to organize bookmarks may seem unconventional, but it's an incredibly efficient and flexible way to manage bookmarks on Ubuntu. By storing bookmarks in text files, we can leverage the power of text manipulation tools and create custom scripts to process and organize bookmarks in any way we want.

So, give this secret trick a try and unlock the power of command line bookmark management today!

Browser bookmarks, though not discussed as often as they should be, are an integral part of browsing the Internet. Without good bookmark functionality, a website might be lost in time, and the ability to revisit it gone. That’s why it’s really important to have a good bookmark manager.
 
All modern web browsers offer up some form of management tool, though they seriously lack in features. If you’ve grown tired of these mainstream tools that have been packed into your browser, you might want to seek out an alternative. Introducing Buku: the command line-based bookmark manager. It has the ability to not only manage your bookmarks, but it can encrypt them, hold them in a database, and more. Here’s how to get going with it!
 
## Installation
 

 
Buku isn’t very popular. As a result, users will need to build it to use it. Still, installing it and getting it going on Ubuntu is a lot easier than it looks. Start by opening the terminal and using apt to install git and python3, as they are vital in building the software.
 
After the needed tools are installed, the source code can be pulled down.
 
Finally, to install it, just run the make command. From here it is possible to launch Buku with buku in any terminal window
 
Note: though this guide focuses on Ubuntu, Buku can be built with similar directions on any Linux distribution.
 
## Importing Bookmarks
 
To import bookmarks directly into the manager, first export all bookmarks from your web browser to an html file. Then, enter the following command:
 
As a result, imported bookmarks will be added to the Buku bookmark database.
 
## Exporting Bookmarks
 
Exporting bookmarks is as simple as importing them into the database. To export all bookmarks, use this command:
 
The bookmark manager, like all others, will export all bookmarks loaded into the database to an HTML file on the system. After that, take your bookmarks and do with them what you will!
 
## Opening Bookmarks
 
To open a bookmark, first the user must search for it. This is done with the -s flag. Run this to search:
 
Then, once a bookmark matching the search has been found, enter the number next to it, and the bookmark will open in the default web browser.
 
## Encryption
 
Unlike other bookmark managers, Buku can actually encrypt your data. This is especially handy for users who have “sensitive” bookmarks. To encrypt the database, use the -l flag to create a password.
 
With the database locked, it will not be possible to access bookmarks without entering the password to decrypt it. To decrypt, use the -k flag.
 
## Other features
 
This bookmark manger is stuffed with many different features. To read about how to use any of the other features, use the --help switch. When this switch is used, every command switch and flag will be listed, and each feature outlined in detail. This comes in handy, as often users forget things, and it’s nice to be able to pull out a cheat-sheet sometimes.
 
## Conclusion
 
Even though this tool isn’t part of any browser, its features are far above any of the current manager offerings out there. Despite the fact that it runs in the command line, it offers up some serious competition. Bookmarks might not be that important to most people, but those who dislike the current choices and love the Linux command line should give Buku a serious shot.
