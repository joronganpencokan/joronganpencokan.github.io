- Right-click on the picture and choose “Format Shape” from the menu.

 
- The “Format Shape” sidebar will open. Under the “Fill” tab, choose “Picture or texture fill.”Select your image.

 
- With the image added inside the shape, use the Transparency slider on the right side under the “Format picture” section to change the transparency.
