# Unlock the Secret to Copying DVDs on Your Mac like a Pro - The Ultimate Step-by-Step Guide!

If you love watching movies, TV shows, or any other video content on DVDs, you might have come across the problem of how to back up or copy them to your computer. Fortunately, this task is not as complicated as you may think, and anyone can do it on their Mac with the right tools and techniques.

In this ultimate step-by-step guide, we will show you how to copy DVDs on your Mac like a pro, without any hassle or frustration. So, let's get started!

## Step 1: Get a DVD ripping software

The first thing you need to do is get a DVD ripping software that is compatible with your Mac. There are many tools available online, some paid, and some free. We recommend using Handbrake, which is free and open-source software that works on both Mac and Windows.

To download Handbrake, go to their official website and choose the version for your Mac. Once downloaded, install it on your computer, and you are ready to go.

## Step 2: Insert the DVD

Next, insert the DVD that you want to copy into your Mac's DVD drive. If you have an external DVD drive, connect it to your Mac and insert the DVD.

Wait for a few seconds, and the DVD will appear on your Mac's desktop. If it doesn't, go to Finder, and you will find it there under Devices.

## Step 3: Open Handbrake and select the DVD

Now it's time to open Handbrake and select the DVD that you want to copy. To do this, open Handbrake from your Applications folder, and you will see a source selection window.

In this window, choose the DVD that you inserted into your Mac, and Handbrake will scan it to see what's on it.

## Step 4: Select the output format

Once Handbrake has scanned the DVD, it's time to choose the output format, which is the format in which you want to copy the DVD to your Mac. Handbrake supports many different formats, so you can choose the one that suits your needs best.

For example, if you want to watch the DVD on your Mac, you can choose the MP4 format, which is compatible with most media players. Or, if you want to burn the DVD to another DVD, you can choose the ISO format.

## Step 5: Choose the destination folder

After selecting the output format, it's time to choose the destination folder where you want to save the copied DVD. You can choose any folder on your Mac or an external hard drive.

Make sure that you have enough space on your computer or external hard drive to save the copied DVD.

## Step 6: Start the copying process

Finally, it's time to start the copying process. To do this, click on the Start button in Handbrake, and it will begin copying the DVD to your Mac.

Depending on the size of the DVD and the speed of your Mac's DVD drive, this process can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more.

Once the copying process is complete, eject the DVD from your Mac's DVD drive, and you're done! You now have a copy of the DVD on your Mac that you can watch or burn to another DVD if you want.

In conclusion, copying DVDs on your Mac is not as complicated as you may think. With the right tools and techniques, anyone can do it like a pro. So, follow this step-by-step guide, and you'll be copying DVDs in no time!

We all love our DVD collections, but few people relish the idea of having to re-buy some of our favorite titles, or losing some of your most cherished family memories because you lost a disk. What is the best way to keep your memories safe, or protect your investment? Make backup copies. While we cannot, of course, suggest that you should make illegal copies of your favorite movies, we can tell you how to make legal copies of non-protected DVD’s. That way, you can make a backup of your daughters dance recital, or your soccer game. These kinds of DVDs will not be copyright protected, so copying them will be fine

At first blush, the idea of copying your DVDs on your Mac is really quite simple. The software in OSX gives you the perfect setup for making multiple copies of your target movie. That way you can burn a new copy, or simply store them on an external hard drive, whichever backup method best suits your backup style. Let’s begin by making and image of the DVD.
 
### How to make an Image of Your Target DVD in Mac OSX
 
Before we can burn, you have to get a copy of the disk image. This will save a copy of the video file onto your computer. Once this is done, you will be able to begin the process of burning your disk. So, get your disk in hand and we will begin the process. All you have to do is follow these steps.
 
1.  Find the DVD that you want to copy. Before you begin, make sure that it is free of any smudges or obvious defects. If it is smudged, then you will want to clean it up before beginning this process. This will ensure that your files transfer smoothly and as quickly as possible. Put in into your DVD drive by inserting it into your slot.
 

 
2.  Click on the words “Macintosh HD” in order to open your hard drive. Then select the “Applications” folder, and the “Utilities”. Once you are in that folder, launch the program labeled disk utility by double clicking on it.
 
3. You should now see the name of the DVD that you want to make an image on in the Disk Utility app. Click on the name of that DVD to select it.
 
4. Navigate your way to the disk utility toolbar, and then choose the words “New Image”. Once you do this, a dialog box will show up on the screen. Give you new copy a name, and choose the location that you want to save the file to. Be sure to choose a location where you will be able to find the file again, since you will need it for the next step when you burn
 
Once this process is done, you can close eject the disk that you just made a copy of, but do not bother to close the Disk Utility, since you will only be using it again in the near future to burn the image.
 
###  Burn the disk image into DVD
 
1. On the top menu bar you will see the word “Burn”, click on this word.
 
2. You will now be given the option to navigate to the saved image that you just burned. Find it and select it by double clicking it. Then click on the word “Burn” again.
 
3. When the system prompts you to, insert a blank DVD into your DVD drive slot.
 
Once the process is done, you will see your new DVD, ready to play, or to go into storage.
