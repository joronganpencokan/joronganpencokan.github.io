Title: Unlock the Secrets: Master How to Grow Your Cult of the Lamb Followers with These Expert Tips!

Introduction:
Are you looking to build a new cult following that revolves around your beliefs and agendas? Although it might sound controversial, a cult following is a unique way to have loyal followers who will support you no matter what. One of the most recent cults that garnered attention in the gaming world is Cult of the Lamb. This strategy game allows you to grow your own followers by “sacrificing” them and unlocking new abilities. In this article, we will give you expert tips to master growing your own Cult of the Lamb following.

Step 1: Create and Define Your Cult

Your cult should have its own unique identity, beliefs, and principles. Make sure to create a name that resonates with your followers and is easy to remember. You can then create your cult’s backstory, religious beliefs, and a visual identity (symbols, colors, and emblems) to help your followers recognize your cult in the game.

Step 2: Provide Value to Your Followers

One of the critical aspects of building a cult is to provide value to your followers. In Cult of the Lamb, this value can be provided by enhancing their skills and abilities, providing them with better equipment, and unlocking unique abilities for them. The game allows players to sacrifice followers to acquire different bonuses; however, it’s essential to manage the sacrifice and bonuses to prevent your followers from feeling undervalued.

Step 3: Engage with Your Followers

Interaction with your followers is crucial in Cult of the Lamb. Engaging with them can increase loyalty and deepen relationships with them. The game offers various ways to interact with your followers: training, fighting, and sacrificing. It’s essential to strike a balance between these activities to keep your followers loyal to your cause. Also, take the time to celebrate milestones and victories with your followers.

Step 4: Expand Your Cult

To grow your cult following in the game, you need to expand your influence by acquiring new followers who share your values and beliefs. You can achieve this by participating in battles and missions, where you can recruit followers from defeated opponents. There are also bonus levels where you can earn more followers, which you can then transplant into other levels.

Step 5: Master Sacrifice

To unlock the full potential of your cult, you need to master the art of sacrifice. Sacrifice provides followers with unique bonuses and powers but requires careful management to prevent your followers from feeling undervalued. Use your abilities, equipment, and bonuses to grow your followers, but ensure that you’re not sacrificing them for no good reason.

Conclusion: 
Building a cult following in Cult of the Lamb is not an easy task, but it can be an incredibly rewarding experience if you follow the expert tips above. Remember to define your cult, provide value to your followers, engage with them, expand your influence, and master the art of sacrifice. By doing so, you will unlock the secrets of growing a loyal and supportive cult following that will help you conquer the game world.

### Blessing Them
 
You will have different Follower actions as you interact with your followers. While you can bless them at the start, you can also intimidate and inspire them with different doctrines. These actions will increase their level and loyalty. In addition to that, you can also bribe your followers with a few gold coins to increase their loyalty.
 
### Sermon Activities
 
You can conduct daily Sermons to increase faith and level up loyalty among your Cult. As these followers level up, they will offer you the Commandment stones. For every 3 Commandment Fragments by the followers, you can introduce a new Doctrine. And with a new doctrine, your cult can work in more harmony.
 
### Completing Quests
 
As you stand or walk around in your Cultist camp, lots of followers will ask you for help. Being the cult leader, you can increase plenty of loyalty for completing these quests. It can simply be any request from the followers. And these requests can get quite bizarre too. For example, a follower can ask you to pull a prank or practical joke on other followers. They can also request you to find them a certain item or greet the new followers yourself.
 
### Rituals
 
You can also conduct and perform several rituals to bring together your followers. Certain rituals can increase the loyalty of all of your followers. You also perform an ascension of a follower that you are willing to go separate ways with. You can also increase the loyalty of your followers with particular doctrines. One of these includes assigning one of your followers a Loyalty Enforcer. His/ Her entire job will be to make all the cult members love and be more loyal to you.
 

 
### Cooking 3-Star Meals
 
While you are a leader of the entire cult, you make a horrible cook when you start. But you can improve that by consequently cooking meals. The Splendid Vegetable Feast and Magnificent mixed meal are some of the meals that give a loyalty boost to your followers.
 
### Commandment Stone
 
As mentioned earlier, you will receive the Commandment stones when you level up your followers. You can use these commandment stones to unlock several additional doctrines. Check out our guide on the best doctrines to use in Cult of the Lamb.
 
### Gifts
 
This is the most obvious way to increase the loyalty of your beloved cultists. As you find specific items throughout the open world, you can gift them to your followers to boost their loyalty. While these gifts don’t offer additional bonuses, they can help in leveling up your followers. You can give one gift to a follower and they will take that gift to their graves. If you want to have the gift back, you can head to their burials and loot the gift from their corpses. Just make sure that you do this in private when no cult member is around.
