Unleash Chaos in Persona 5 Strikers – Learn How to Lower Your Security Level Now

Persona 5 Strikers is not your typical role-playing game. Unlike its predecessor, Persona 5, Strikers brings a whole new dimension to the table – a hack-and-slash combat system. Whether you are a die-hard fan of Persona 5 or just getting started, Strikers’ real-time action will keep you on the edge of your seat.

But for all its high-octane thrills, the game’s mechanics can be tricky to navigate. One particularly pesky obstacle is the Security Level. In Strikers, your characters must fight their way through enemy strongholds to uncover the plot, but every fight increases the Security Level in the zone you’re in. When it reaches 100%, the party is forced to flee and come back later. Luckily there are ways to lower it so that you can continue with your game.

Here are some useful tips on how to lower the Security Level:

1. Stealth is Your Friend

The easiest way to lower Security Level is to avoid getting into fights altogether. Sneak up on enemies by using cover, and plan your movements around their patrol routes. Generally, if you keep to the shadows and move slowly, you’ll be less likely to trigger a Security Level increase.

2. Take Out Cameras and Turrets

In Strikers, cameras and turrets are your number one foe when it comes to keeping the Security Level low. They’re designed to detect and report your movements, and once alerted, your Security Level will skyrocket. So, it’s best to take them down as quickly as possible. You can do this with either melee strikes, gunshots, or hacking with a character’s unique Persona skill.

3. Use Phantom Dash

Phantom Dash is a lifesaver when it comes to evading enemy attacks and lowering the Security Level in Strikers. It allows you to dodge and roll out of harm’s way, all while moving at breakneck speeds. By using this skill, you can quickly whisk through enemy-dense areas and avoid being detected entirely, keeping your Security Level from increasing.

4. Use Confuse and Forget Skills

Certain enemy types in Strikers come equipped with unique skills that can increase your Security Level, so it’s important to use all the tools at your disposal. Utilize the Confuse and Forget skills to manipulate enemy behavior, causing them to attack themselves or forget their purpose entirely. By doing so, you’ll be able to lower your Security Level and keep your party safe.

5. Get In and Get Out

Sometimes, the best way to keep the Security Level low is to move through an area quickly. In Strikers, enemy respawns are fairly frequent, so it’s best to focus on completing objectives rather than clearing every enemy from an area. Once you’ve accomplished your goal, get out – a higher Security Level will only make your trip more difficult.

In conclusion, the Security Level in Persona 5 Strikers can give even the most experienced gamers a run for their money. But, as long as you use stealth, take out enemy turrets and cameras, use Phantom Dash, deploy confusion and forget skills, and stay focused on objectives, you can easily keep the Security Level low and take down the toughest opponents in Strikers. And once you’ve mastered the game’s mechanics, you’ll be able to fully appreciate the fast-paced action and complex story that make Persona 5 Strikers well worth playing.
