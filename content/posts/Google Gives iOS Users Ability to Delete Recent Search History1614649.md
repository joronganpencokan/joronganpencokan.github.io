# Revolutionary News: Google Finally Shows Mercy to iOS Users by Offering the Power to Erase Search History!

In a long overdue move, Google has finally shown mercy to iOS users. The tech giant has announced that users on Apple devices will now be able to erase their search history within the Google app for the first time. The move represents a significant shift in the way Google views its relationship with iOS users, and is a clear indication that the company is taking steps to improve user privacy and security.

For people who use Apple's Safari browser, this change may not seem like a big deal. The browser has long allowed users to clear their browsing history, cookies, and cache. However, for those who use Google's app on iOS devices, the ability to erase search history has been sorely lacking. This has been a major issue for privacy-minded iOS users who have long been clamoring for the feature.

With the new update, iOS users can now easily delete their search history within the Google app. They can also select how far back they want to go when deleting their history, giving them greater control over their search data. This move is a significant departure from Google's previous stance on user privacy, which has often been called into question.

One of the reasons Google has faced criticism for its handling of user data is due to its reliance on advertising revenue. The company is known for collecting vast amounts of user data in order to serve targeted advertisements. However, this has led to concerns about how the data is used, and whether it is being shared with third parties.

By offering the ability to delete search history, Google is taking a step toward addressing these concerns. The move shows that the company is willing to acknowledge the importance of user privacy and take steps to protect it. It also aligns with recent efforts by other tech companies to improve user privacy and security.

Overall, this is a positive step by Google, and one that should be celebrated. It shows that the company is listening to its users and taking action to address their concerns. For iOS users, the ability to erase search history is a long-awaited feature that will make a significant difference in their privacy and security online.

In conclusion, it is important for tech companies to prioritize user privacy and security. By offering the ability to erase search history on iOS devices, Google is taking a step in the right direction. This move should be applauded, and we hope to see more efforts from the tech giant to improve user privacy and security in the future.

Google's new feature that allows you to delete the last 15 minutes of your search history is now available for iOS. 

 

The feature originally was announced during May’s Google i/O event as an additional option to Google Search’s auto-delete feature. You’ll be able to delete the last 15 minutes of your search history with a single tap from the Google Account Menu. 

 

Google said the feature is only available if you have the Google app for iOS, and that it will come to the Android app later this year. 

 

Other auto-delete controls Google announced on Thursday include the ability to choose to automatically delete your Search history after three, 18, or 36 months. It’s important to note that new accounts automatically delete after 18 months, but you can update these settings. 

 

Other search updates Google announced on Thursday include the ability to lock your My Activity page behind an extra sign-in page. This feature is especially handy if you share a device with someone else, such as your kids, so others won’t have access to what you’ve been searching for on Google. 

 

Google’s push to prioritize privacy this year also includes other recent updates like a new safety section within Google Play to provide more transparency into the data that apps collect and share. The tech giant said the new safety section will make developers disclose what information is collected and stored within their apps and how that data is used (i.e., for app functionality or personalization). 

 
Google said the feature is only available if you have the Google app for iOS and that it would come to the Android app later this year.
 

Earlier this year, Google also introduced a new app policy restricting "broad app visibility" to specific apps to provide more security for Android users. Experts say this means that apps will have a harder time getting access to information from the other apps on your phone, increasing your phone’s security.
