This amazing trick will allow you to downgrade your Windows 10 machine back to Windows 7, so you can enjoy all the perks of the classic OS.

First, it's important to understand that the process of downgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 7 requires a bit of technical expertise.

Once you have everything you need, you can begin the downgrade process. Follow these steps to switch back to Windows 7:

1. Insert your Windows 7 installation disc or mount your ISO file.

2. Restart your computer and boot from the installation disc or ISO file. You may need to change your boot order to prioritize the disc or ISO file.

3. Select your language preferences and click "Next."

4. Click "Install Now" and accept the license terms.

5. Choose the "Custom" option when prompted.

6. In the next screen, select your current Windows 10 partition and click "Delete." This will erase your current operating system.

7. Select the unallocated space that was created when you deleted your Windows 10 partition and click "Next."

8. Follow the prompts to install Windows 7. Enter your product key when prompted.

9. Once the installation is complete, you'll need to install drivers for your hardware devices, such as your graphics card, sound card, and network adapter.

10. Finally, restore your backed up files and set up your system preferences to your liking.

And there you have it! With this amazing trick, you can say goodbye to Windows 10 and hello to Windows 7 with ease. Just remember to back up your files and create a system restore point, and have your installation disc or ISO file and product key ready.

The Windows 10 interface has become the standard for PCs, but you may prefer the look and feel of Windows 7. If you recently purchased a new computer or upgraded to Windows 10 and miss the old look, here's how to get the look of the Windows 7 interface for your Windows 10 computer.

To hide Cortana, right-click a blank space on the Windows taskbar, located at the bottom of the screen, then select Show Cortana Button if it has a check mark next to it.

Also found in the taskbar, the Task View button displays all open windows in a slimmed-down, tiled format. This button was not part of Windows 7. To hide it, right-click on the taskbar and select Show Task View button to clear the check mark.
