Have you ever received a notification on your Android device and accidentally swiped it away before you had the chance to read it? It's a frustrating experience that happens to all of us at some point. But what if we told you that Android has a hidden feature known as Notification History that can help you manage and review all your past notifications with just one click? Here's how to unlock this secret and take control of your notification history.

Step 1: Access the Notification Log    

The first step in accessing your notification history is to enable the Notification Log. To do this, go to your device's Settings, then scroll down to the System section and tap on "Developer options." If you don't see this section, you can enable it by going to "About phone" and tapping on the build number multiple times until you see a message that says "you are now a developer."

Once you're in the Developer options, scroll down to the "Debugging" section and find the "Enable USB debugging" option. Toggle the switch to enable it, and you'll see a new setting called "Notification log." Tap on this option, and you'll be taken to your device's Notification Log.

Step 2: Review Your Notification History

Once you're in the Notification Log, you'll see a list of all your past notifications, including those that you may have accidentally swiped away. To review a particular notification, simply tap on it, and you'll see more details, including the app that sent it and the time it was received.

You can also clear your notification history by tapping on the "Clear all" button at the top of the screen. This will remove all your past notifications from the log.

Step 3: Customize Your Notification History

If you want to customize the way your notification history is displayed, you can do so by going to your device's Settings, then tapping on "Apps & notifications." From here, find the app that you want to change and tap on it. You'll see various options, including "Notifications" and "App notifications."

In the Notifications section, you can enable or disable notifications for the app, choose how they're displayed, and even set different notification tones. In the App notifications section, you can control how the app's notifications appear in your notification shade and whether or not they show up on your lock screen.

Conclusion

Android's Notification History feature is a hidden gem that can help you manage and review all your past notifications with ease. By enabling this feature and taking control of your notification history, you'll never have to worry about losing an important notification again. So go ahead and unlock this hidden secret on your Android device, and start taking control of your notification history today!

The app is rather straightforward in terms of both functionality and what problem of your digital life it aims to mend. “Notification History Log” records every notification that your phone receives and creates a searchable database from it. Therefore, even if you miss any alert, you can just fire up the app, type in the search phrase or scroll through the entire list and revisit that tiny bit of information again. There’s also an option for checking Android’s native notification log but that only shows the app name, not the notification content. The cornerstone of this app lies in the “advanced history” tab.
To get started, head over to the Play Store and download “Notification History Log”. Once that’s done, launch the app and grant all the necessary permissions so that it can read your incoming notifications. That’s about it. Now, whenever you’d like to read a past notification, open up the app, tap “Advanced History” and there you have it.
Tapping on any individual notification can take you to the respective app, its Play Store listing or the info page in settings. The only feature missing from this app right now is that it doesn’t link to the specific page of the app from where the notification was generated. For instance, if it’s a WhatsApp message, the app can launch WhatsApp but not the particular chat window.

If you’re unable to locate the particular alert, you can search as well by tapping the icon present on the top bar. For dismissing an entry in the advanced history, you can swipe left from the right edge. However, this is a Pro feature for which you’ll have to shed an extra dollar and a half. Another Pro perk is the ability to block specific applications from appearing on the list. In addition to that, the Pro purchase will get rid of in-app ads too. Hence, if this is something you see yourself using quite often, the premium package seems like a no-brainer.
