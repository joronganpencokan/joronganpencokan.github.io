Step Three: Click on "Create List"
After clicking on the "Friends" icon, click on "More" at the bottom of the list to view additional options. Then, click on "Create List" to create your Custom Friends List.

Step Four: Add Friends to Your Custom List
In this step, you are now ready to add your Facebook friends to your Custom List. You can add each person individually by typing their name in the search bar or choosing them from the suggested list. Moreover, you can also select common friends, family members or work colleagues and add them to your Custom Friends List, depending on the purpose of the List.

Step Five: Give Your Custom List a Name
Now it's time to give your Custom List a unique name. You can choose a name that relates to the group of people in your Custom List or the purpose of the List. For instance, you can name your Custom List "Work Colleagues," "Family Members," "Close Friends," etc.

Step Six: Set Your Custom List Privacy
Finally, you can control the privacy settings of your Custom List by deciding who can see the List or who can't. You can either make it public, private or add specific Facebook friends to view the List. This option is crucial in managing your online privacy and keeping private individuals, conversations or purposes away from public eyes.

Conclusion:
Facebook has many features that can make our online experience enjoyable, exciting and entertaining. Nevertheless, it's essential to manage your account efficiently to avoid spam, clutter, or security breaches. Creating your Custom Friends List can help you do that in minutes.
