# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Install Windows 10 on a Brand New Hard Drive - Step-by-Step Guide Inside!

Installing a brand new hard drive can be an exciting experience, especially for those who are getting ready to build their own computer. However, it can also be a daunting task for those who have never done it before. But, installing Windows 10 on a new hard drive is easier than you might think. In this step-by-step guide, we will show you just how easy it is to install Windows 10 on a brand new hard drive.

## What You Will Need

Before we get started with the step-by-step guide, first let's take a look at what you will need to complete this task.

- **A brand new hard drive:** Make sure the hard drive is compatible with your computer.
- **Windows 10 installation media:** This can either be a USB drive or a DVD.
- **A working PC:** You will need access to a working PC to create the installation media.

## Step 1: Create Installation Media

The first step is to create an installation media for Windows 10. To do this, you will need to download the Media Creation Tool from the official Microsoft website. Once downloaded, run the tool and select "Create installation media for another PC." Follow the prompts and select the language, edition, and architecture of the Windows 10 you want to install. Then, choose whether you want to create a USB drive or a DVD.

## Step 2: Backup Important Data

Before you begin the installation process, make sure to backup any important data and files on your computer. Once the installation process begins, you will lose all data and files on your computer. 

## Step 3: Connect the Hard Drive

Next, you will need to connect the brand new hard drive to your computer. If you are replacing an existing hard drive, make sure to disconnect it first.

## Step 4: Enter BIOS

Turn on your computer and enter the BIOS settings. This can usually be done by pressing one of the function keys (F1, F2, F3, etc.) or the Delete key. Once in the BIOS settings, change the boot order to boot from the installation media (USB or DVD) you created in Step 1.

## Step 5: Install Windows 10

Once the computer has booted from the installation media, select "Install Now" and follow the prompts to install Windows 10 on the new hard drive. Make sure to select the correct hard drive during the installation process. 

## Step 6: Activate Windows 10

After the installation process is complete, you will need to activate Windows 10. If you have a product key, enter it when prompted. If you do not have a product key, you can still use Windows 10 but with limited features.

## Step 7: Install Drivers

Finally, install the necessary drivers for your computer. This can usually be done by downloading them from the manufacturer's website. 

And that's it! You have successfully installed Windows 10 on a brand new hard drive. As you can see, the process is easier than you may have thought. With just a few simple steps, you can have Windows 10 up and running on your new hard drive in no time.

##   How Do I Install Windows 10 on a New Hard Drive?  
 

Before you begin installing Windows 10 to a new drive, it may be beneficial to unplug any other drives that are connected – especially if they contain sensitive data that you wish to preserve. You don't have to do this, but if you do it makes it impossible for you to accidentally delete anything, so is worth considering.

 
- Install your new hard drive (or SSD) in your computer.
 - Plug in your Windows 10 installation USB drive or insert the Windows 10 disk.
 - Change the boot order in the BIOS to boot from your install media.
 - Boot to your Windows 10 installation USB drive or DVD.
 - When given the option, select the Language, Time, and Keyboard Language, then select Next.
 - Input your license (or product) key.
 - Select Install Now.
 - Confirm that you accept the License Agreement and select Next.
 - Select Custom: Install Windows only (Advanced).
 - The following screen will give you hard access to all the drives installed on your system. When it comes to selecting which one to format and install Windows to, it is incredibly important that you select the correct one. If you accidentally select a different drive, that data may be irreparably lost, or hard to recover.
 - When asked Where do you want to install Windows, look for your new drive. It should be easy to spot because it will be entirely Unallocated Space and will be the same size as the new drive. Select that drive and select Format. You can create your own preferred number of partitions by selecting New, or, just select Next to begin the Windows installation.

 

Windows will then begin installing on your new hard drive. Depending on the speed of your hard drive and your PC's processor, this process may take some time. Regardless of how long it takes, you'll be able to follow along as the status page moves through the process.

##   Can I Clean Install Windows 10 on a New Hard Drive?  
 

Absolutely. It's arguably the easiest way to install Windows 10 as you don't need to worry about backing up any data and the drive is almost guaranteed to work perfectly without any hardware issues from years of use.

 
##   How Do I Install Windows 10 Without The Disk?  
 

To install Windows 10 on a new hard drive without the installation disk, you'll need to make a Windows 10 installation USB drive.

 
##   How Do I Install Windows 10 on a New Computer Without Operating System?  
 

The process for installing Windows 10 on a new computer without an operating system is exactly the same as it would be if you were doing so on a computer with an operating system. The only caveat to that is that you need the installation media, whether that's a Windows 10 disk, or a bootable USB drive with Windows 10 installation files loaded on it. Getting that can be a little harder without an active PC.

 

If you don't have either of those, you'll have to buy them direct from Microsoft. Alternatively, if you have a Windows 10 key, but no way to install it, you could buy a Windows disk (only) from a second-hand site, or alternatively, use a friend's computer to create a bootable Windows 10 install USB.

 

Once you have the install media in hand, follow the same steps as you would to install Windows 10 on a new hard drive as above.

 
- How long does it take to install Windows 10?
 - It's hard to estimate exactly how long a full installation of Windows 10 takes. It could take minutes or hours, depending on the age of your computer, the amount of RAM it has, whether it uses a solid-state drive, or whether or not it's a clean installation or an upgrade.
 - How can you install Linux on Windows 10?
 - First, you need to create a partition on your hard drive. Then, create a Linux bootable USB and use it to install Linux on your Windows 10 PC.
