# Magical revelation: How to pick your perfect Hogwarts House and wand in Legacy!

As a witch or wizard, one of the most exciting moments of your life will be the day you receive your letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Being sorted into a Hogwarts House and receiving your wand are essential moments in the wizarding world. These events will help shape the foundation of your magical life.

In the game Legacy, players are given the opportunity to experience the magical world of Hogwarts by attending classes, creating friendships, and competing in duels. One of the most exciting elements of the game is getting sorted into a Hogwarts House and discovering your perfect wand. These elements are based on the characters created by J.K. Rowling in the Harry Potter series, which have been brought to life in the game.

So, how do you find your perfect Hogwarts House and wand in Legacy? Let's find out!

## Hogwarts House Sorting

In Legacy, the sorting ceremony is based on the famous scene from the Harry Potter books and movies. You'll be led by the sorting hat in a virtual Hogwarts castle to be sorted into one of four Houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.

Each House represents certain characteristics that are unique to their students. For instance, Gryffindor traits include courage, bravery, and daring, while Hufflepuff encompasses loyalty, hard work, and patience. Ravenclaw is known for wit, intelligence, and creativity, while Slytherin values ambition, cunning, and resourcefulness.

When the sorting hat is placed on your head, it will analyze your characteristics and determine which House you belong in. Once you've been sorted, you'll have access to House-specific events and activities, and you'll meet other players who share your House.

## Wand Selection

In Legacy, the wand you receive is unique to you and is based on the magical world created by Rowling. Your wand will be selected based on a series of questions that gauge your personality and preferences. For instance, you might be asked about your favorite color, animal, and activity.

Once your wand is selected, you'll have access to new spells that are unique to your wand. You'll also be able to customize your wand with various accessories such as wood type and length.

## Conclusion

Being sorted into a Hogwarts House and receiving a wand is a rite of passage in the wizarding world. In Legacy, the opportunity to be sorted and receive a unique wand is an exciting experience that stays true to the magical world of Harry Potter.

So, what are you waiting for? Sign up for Legacy and discover your perfect Hogwarts House and wand. Remember, the wand chooses the wizard, and the House chooses the student!

## How to Choose Your Hogwarts Legacy House & Wand Early

- Head over to the Wizarding World page. And hit the Login button at the top-right of your screen.
 - Click on the “Sign Up Now” option below if you haven’t created the account.
 - Enter your Birth date and email address to set up your profile account.
 - To complete your profile, you need to complete three criteria. These are choosing your House, Patronus, and Wand.

 

 
- As you hit the + button above them, you will get some quizzes to answer. We suggest answering them with solemn truth as they will decide your fate.
 - Once you are done with all three quizzes, your Wizarding World account will be completed.
 - Then, head over to the WB Games and log in to your existing account. If you don’t have one already, you can sign up for a new account.
 - Now, hit the three lines on the top-left of your screen and click on Connections from the menu on your left.
