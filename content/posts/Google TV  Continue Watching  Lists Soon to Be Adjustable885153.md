# Revolutionary Update: Google TV to Introduce Customizable 'Continue Watching' Lists - Prepare to be Amazed!

Google TV has been a popular streaming service for quite some time, but the latest update is about to change the way we watch TV shows and movies. The company has announced that they will introduce a customizable 'continue watching' list, and it's going to revolutionize the way we consume entertainment.

The new feature lets users easily pick up where they left off in their favorite shows and movies, regardless of the device they're using. It's great news for all those who have binge-watched on their phones, tablets, and smart TVs. With this new feature, you'll be able to customize your 'continue watching' list based on your preferences and watch history. It's a game-changer for the streaming industry that's sure to be a hit among viewers.

## How it Works

The customizable 'continue watching' list works by gathering data on your watching habits. It takes into account the shows and movies you've watched in the past and the episodes you've started but haven't finished. Using this data, Google TV then organizes your 'continue watching' list in a way that suits your tastes.

Users will also have the option to remove shows or movies they no longer want to keep in their 'continue watching' list. Plus, the feature will expand beyond Google TV with the ability to sync with Android TV and Chromecast. This means that you can pick up exactly where you left off, regardless of which device you're using.

## The Benefits

The benefits of this new feature are endless. First and foremost, it saves a lot of time for users. There's no need to search for the last episode you watched or remember where you left off. It's all in one place, easy to find, and instantly accessible.

Another benefit is that this feature will recommend content based on your watch history. If you're someone who loves crime thrillers, you'll see suggestions for the latest must-watch titles in the genre. This means that users will have access to curated playlists of their favorite genres, making it easier to discover new titles to watch.

## Final Thoughts

The introduction of the customizable 'continue watching' list is a game-changer for the streaming industry. It's an excellent example of how technology is evolving to enhance our viewing experience and cater to our individual preferences. This new feature will make it easier for users to watch their favorite shows and movies, and encourage them to explore new content.

Google TV has always been known for its user-friendly interface, and this feature is no exception. It's easy to use and designed to create a more personalized experience for each viewer. So, get ready to be amazed by this revolutionary update and enjoy your favorite shows and movies more than ever before!

Google TV has begun letting some users curate their "Continue Watching" lists, making it easier to get back to the shows they want to watch or hide the content they don't want to finish.

 

Reddit user Alfatango97 pointed out that Google TV was leaving films and shows in the Continue Watching list, even if they were finished, making it difficult to keep watching other content. Now, after contacting Google to bring the issue to light, the option to Hide media in the Continue Watching list has begun appearing for some users.

 

As 9to5Google points out, the ability to hide movies and shows you don't want to see any longer is an existing feature for Android TV, but this is a first for Google TV.

 

While Android TV uses a pop-up, Chrome TV uses a menu selection function via a long-press on the remote's center button while highlighting a specific entry's card. This opens a secondary menu with an option to hide the selected video.

 

With the rollout still underway, there's no concrete information on which devices will be able to use the feature or when it will be more widely available yet. It's confirmed on the new Chromecast and assumed for compatible Sony TVs, but 9to5Google has yet to access the function on any of the devices it has tested.

 

Google also has remained silent on the Google TV update, providing no information on which devices will be supported and no additional details on when it will be made more widely available.
