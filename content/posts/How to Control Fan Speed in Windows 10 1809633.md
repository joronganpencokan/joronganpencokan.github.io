Rev Up Your PC’s Performance: The Ultimate Windows 10 Fan Speed Control Guide!

Have you ever experienced the frustration of your PC’s fan making noise, even when its idle? Or have you noticed your PC crashing due to overheating? Well, fret not because the solution to your problem lies within your PC’s Fan Speed Control Settings.

Windows 10 Fan Speed Control Settings allows you to control the speed of your PC’s fan, thus improving its performance and longevity, making your experience with it all the more smooth.

Here are some easy steps to make use of the Fan Speed Control Settings in Windows 10:

Step 1: Finding the Fan Speed Control Settings

The Fan Speed Control Settings can be found in the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System). The BIOS is the first thing that your PC does when it starts, and it controls all the hardware, including the fan.

Step 2: Entering the BIOS

To enter the BIOS settings, restart the PC and press the designated key depending on the motherboard you have. Generally, it’s either F2 or the ‘Del’ key.

Step 3: Finding the Fan Control Settings

Once you are in the BIOS, locate the option that controls the fan speed. This setting will be named System Fan Control, Fan Control, or something similar, depending on your system.

Step 4: Adjusting the Fan Control Settings

Make sure you have enabled the Fan Control Settings before adjusting it. By enabling it, your PC’s fan will start spinning as soon as the power is turned on. Once enabled, adjust the speed of the fan according to your preference by browsing through the options in the Fan Control Settings.

Step 5: Saving and Exiting the BIOS

Once you have made the necessary changes, save and exit the BIOS settings. Your PC will restart, and the settings you have made will be applied.

Apart from these steps, there are also third-party apps you can download to control the fan speed. Fan control apps such as SpeedFan, Argus Monitor and HW Monitor will give you even more control and customization options to fine-tune the fan speed to your liking.

In conclusion, controlling the Fan Speed Settings in your PC can prove to be a significant step in optimizing your PC’s performance. By keeping your PC’s temperature in check, you will prolong its lifespan and avoid sudden crashes. So, the next time your PC’s fan starts to make a noise, adjust the Fan Speed Control Settings, and rest easy knowing your PC is running smoothly.

All the major hardware components of a PC, majorly CPU & GPU, generate an immense amount of heat during their working, especially when heavy resource-consuming applications are running. Heat is the main culprit behind permanent hardware damage due to over-heating, as dust just works as a catalyst for it. Primarily, an effective cooling system is required to handle the heating issues. To solve this issue, CPU fans are introduced, which cools down the heating effectively & efficiently. Today, a large variety of fans are available in the market, from small capacity to high capacity. And the PC fan speed is controllable by using various applications. So, keep reading this article to know how to perform fan control Windows 10 in detail.
 

 
## How to Control Fan Speed in Windows 10
 
A CPU fan is a crucial part of the computer hardware found in the motherboard, which can be a life-saver. Its most heroic function is to continuously cool down the hot CPU and prevent it from permanent damage due to burning out. It’s the CPU fan that saves the CPU and other nearby components from damage due to overheating and keeps the PC running.

- It not only provides cooling but also prevents dust from accumulating in the CPU.
 - The power of CPU fans is measured in RPM, which decides the PC fan speed.
 - It can be detached from the CPU and then attached back to the motherboard after cleaning.
 - Higher the RPM higher the power of cooling. Also, gamers, graphic designers, animators, and VFX designers need the highest capacity and high-power fans to cool down their scorching CPU.

 
Fans are connected to the motherboard by:
 
- 3-pin DC connector: Speed can be altered by limiting the voltage.
 - 4-pin PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) connector: Speed can be controlled using software easily.

 
We are here with the guide on how to control fan speed in Windows 10 and how to change CPU fan speed without BIOS. Follow these methods to control pc fan speed:
