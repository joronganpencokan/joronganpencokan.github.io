# Unlock the Power of OPML - Learn How to Edit, Convert and Open Files like a Pro!

If you're a content creator or an active user of productivity tools, then you've probably heard about OPML. But what exactly is it, and how can you use it to enhance your workflow? In this article, we'll explore the wonders of OPML and teach you how to edit, convert, and open OPML files like a pro. So, let's get started!

## What is OPML?

OPML stands for Outline Processor Markup Language. It's a file format primarily used for creating, editing, and sharing outlines of information. An outline is a structured way of organizing data, which can include everything from brainstorming notes to project plans. OPML files can contain text, links, images, and even metadata, making them highly versatile for various applications.

## How to Edit OPML Files?

One of the significant advantages of OPML is its portability. You can create and edit OPML files on different devices and using various software tools. The simplest way to edit an OPML file is to use a text editor such as Notepad, TextEdit, or Sublime Text. However, this method can be a bit cumbersome, especially if you're working with large or complex outlines.

Another way to edit OPML files is to use dedicated software applications such as OmniOutliner, Workflowy, or Microsoft OneNote. These tools provide advanced features such as drag-and-drop rearrangement, formatting options, import/export functionalities, and more. Some applications also offer collaboration features, which allow multiple users to work on an outline in real-time.

## How to Convert OPML Files?

Converting OPML files to other formats is also relatively simple. You can use online conversion tools such as Convertio, Zamzar, or CloudConvert. These tools support various file formats, including Word, Excel, PDF, HTML, and more. You only need to upload your OPML file, select the desired format, and click on the convert button. The resulting file will be available for download within seconds.

If you prefer a desktop-based application, you can use software such as Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat. These applications offer a wider range of conversion options, including batch conversion and advanced customization. However, they can be more expensive and require more technical skills.

## How to Open OPML Files?

Opening OPML files is another straightforward process. You only need a compatible application or web browser to view the file's contents. Most web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, support OPML files natively. If you click on an OPML file's hyperlink, it will automatically open in your default web browser, displaying a structured list of links, text, or other data.

If you prefer a more dedicated application, you can use software such as RSS readers or news aggregators. These tools are designed to parse OPML files and fetch the associated web feeds. Some popular examples of RSS readers include Feedly, Inoreader, and NewsBlur. These applications allow you to customize your news sources, track updates, and share your favorite articles with others.

## Conclusion

In summary, OPML is a highly useful file format for organizing, sharing and collaborating on complex data sets. Whether you're a writer, researcher, marketer, or project manager, OPML can help you streamline your workflow and boost your productivity. By following the tips and tricks outlined in this article, you can become a master of OPML and take your content management skills to the next level!

This article describes what OPML files are, how to open one, and how to convert one to a different format like XML, HTML, CSV, etc.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- An OPML file is an Outline Processor Markup Language file.
 - Open one with Feedly.
 - Convert to CSV with opml2csv.com, or to HTML with Tkoutline.

 
##   What Is an OPML File?  
 

A file with the OPML file extension is an Outline Processor Markup Language file. It's saved in a particular structure using the XML format, and is used to exchange information between applications regardless of the operating system.

 

This file format is often seen used as the import/export format for RSS feed reader programs. Since an OPML file can hold a collection of RSS subscription information, it's the ideal format for backing up or sharing RSS feeds.

 
##   How to Open an OPML File  
 

Almost any program that manages RSS feeds should be able to import and export OPML files. Feedly is one example that can import one (log in and open the OPML Import page). The Thunderbird email client should work as well.

 

If you find an OPML file online and would like to see what's in it, there's a tool called OPML Viewer that will do just that.

 

Tkoutline and ConceptDraw's MINDMAP can open it, too.

 

A simple text editor is another way. See our Best Free Text Editors list for some of our favorites. Remember, however, that an actual RSS feed aggregator like Feedly is the best way to actually make the OPML feed entries useful (i.e., show the content that the feeds are from). A text editor is really only good for editing the file or viewing just the text content.

 

On that note, any XML or text editor can be used to make changes to an OPML file.

 
##   How to Convert an OPML File  
 

The Tkouline program mentioned above can be used to convert an OPML file to HTML or XML.

 
If you find that an application on your PC does try to open the file but it's the wrong application or you'd rather have another installed program open it, see our How to Change File Associations in Windows guide to do that.
 

OPML files can also be converted to CSV for use in a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel. This online tool at opml2csv.com can do that.

 

Pandoc is another converter that can save the XML data from the OPML file to a huge variety of formats like AsciiDoc, markdown, LaTeX, and others.

 
##   More Information on the OPML File Format  
 

In a typical OPML file, there's a head element that describes the title, owner, or some other metadata information. With an RSS feed, this is normally the article's title. Following that is the body tag that holds the content of what the file is describing, and the outline element to hold attributes or other outline sub-elements.

 

OPML was created by UserLand with the original intent being for a file format that belonged to the word processor tool built into the Radio UserLand software.

 
##   Still Can't Open It?  
 

If you can't open your file with the suggestions from above, the first thing you should check is that you're actually dealing with an OPML file. Some file extensions look similar but are in fact not related at all, and therefore don't work with the programs above.

 

For example, you might really have an OMP file, which could be an Office Manager Document Archive file or an OpenMind Window Document file. Although the extension looks an awful lot like OPML, they aren't the same format and can't open with the same applications. The former is a format created by the Krekeler Office Manager Pro software, and the latter works with MatchWare MindView.

 

OPAL is similar; it's used by Microsoft Office Customization Tool as a Microsoft Office User Settings file to customize how MS Office is installed.
