# Revolutionize Your Scheduling Game: Create Your Own Calendar Server using Owncloud!

Are you tired of juggling multiple calendars and constantly updating each one separately? Or maybe you're tired of relying on a third-party calendar system that doesn't quite meet your needs. Whatever your reasons may be, creating your own calendar server using Owncloud can be a game-changer in your scheduling game. 

So, what exactly is Owncloud? It's a free, open-source software that allows you to create your own cloud-based storage and collaboration platform. In simpler terms, it's a personal cloud that you control. And with its wide range of apps and plugins, you can customize it to suit your unique needs. 

One of the most popular and useful features of Owncloud is its calendar app. With it, you can create multiple calendars (personal, work, family, etc.), schedule appointments, set reminders, and share your calendar with others. All these features are easily accessible through your web browser or mobile app.

Here's how to get started with creating your own calendar server using Owncloud:

1. Install Owncloud on your server: Owncloud has easy installation instructions that you can follow on their website. You’ll need a Linux-based server to start with.

2. Enable the Calendar app: Once you have Owncloud installed, it’s simple to enable the Calendar app in your Owncloud dashboard. From there, you can customize the calendar settings to suit your specific needs.

3. Create a calendar and share it: After enabling and configuring the calendar, it’s time to create your own calendar(s). You can choose to make a personal one or create multiple ones so that you can keep different areas of your life organized. You can then invite other people to access and view your shared calendar with just a few clicks.

4. Start scheduling and organizing: You’re now ready to start scheduling your appointments and keeping track of your life. You can set reminders, add appointments, and even get notifications via email or in-app alerts.

There are many benefits to having your own calendar server. You can have complete control over your data, keep sensitive information private, and integrate it with other tools used for productivity. Whether you’re a freelancer, a small business owner, or just someone who values organization, a personal calendar server can be the perfect addition to your toolkit. 

So, what are you waiting for? Revolutionize your scheduling game and create your own calendar server using Owncloud today!

OwnCloud is more well-known as a self-hosted Dropbox alternative. It allows you to host your own cloud storage server and synchronize all your data to the cloud and across multiple devices. One thing that most people do not know a Calendar feature has been added in the recent version. This means that you can now host your own Calendar server, rather than using third party service, like Google Calendar.
 
As compared to Google Calendar, OwnCloud’s Calendar feature is not as comprehensive, but it is completely functional and usable. If you are using an older version of OwnCloud, simply upgrade to the latest version and you find the Calendar feature.
 
If you have not started to use OwnCloud, here is the installation instructions (Windows users, click here)
 
Once you are logged into your OwnCloud account, you will see the Calendar button on the left menu. Click on it and it will show the Calendar. You can change the view to Month, Week, or List.
 

 
To add an entry, simply double click on any date. You can add the title, category, access permission, and the time of the event. Opening the Advanced option allows you to add location and description.
 
At the moment, there is no means for you to invite other users to your event, but you can Share, or Export the event after it has been created. You can also export the whole Calendar app, and import it to another OwnCloud’s installation.
 
## Connecting your Desktop client to Owncloud
 
If you are using email clients like Thunderbird or outlook, you will be glad to know that OwnCloud supports CalDav, so you can easily view the calendar in your desktop client, and even sync to it.
 
For most CalDav compatible client, like Kontact, Evolution, Thunderbird, you can connect to your OwnCloud Calender server via the URL:
 
For Apple iCal, use the following URL (including the trailing slash) instead:
 
Mozilla Lightning users need to this URL scheme:
 
## Conclusion
 
Being an open source project, it is great to see that OwnCloud is progressing to be more than just a simple cloud storage service. As more and more features are added to it, you will soon be able to get rid of the third party cloud services and host (almost) everything on your own server. This will at least ease some of the privacy issue that has been rampant recently.
 
What do you think? Will you switch to OwnCloud’s Calendar feature or continuing with Google Calendar, or any other third party Calendar service provider?
