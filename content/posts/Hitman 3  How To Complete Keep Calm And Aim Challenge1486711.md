# Secret Tip Revealed: Unlock the Keep Calm and Aim Challenge in Hitman 3!

If you're a fan of Hitman 3, you know that there are plenty of challenges to face in the game. One challenge you may have heard about is the "Keep Calm and Aim" challenge. This challenge is unique because it requires you to take out your target with a single shot, and without the use of any gadgets or distractions. It's a tough challenge, but completing it is incredibly rewarding.

So, how do you unlock this challenge? Well, the answer is simple: you don't. The Keep Calm and Aim challenge is already unlocked and available for you to attempt. However, you may have trouble finding it because it's not listed under any of the mission-specific challenges. Instead, it's categorized as a Feat challenge, and you can access it by scrolling down the Feats list for each mission.

Now that you know where to find the challenge, let's talk about some tips that will help you complete it. First and foremost, you need to have a sniper rifle. You also need to find a good vantage point that gives you a clear shot at your target. Once you've found a spot, aim for a headshot to take out your target in one shot.

It's important to note that completing this challenge doesn't necessarily mean that you have to do it on your first attempt. You can restart the mission as many times as you need to until you successfully complete the challenge. You can also attempt the challenge on any difficulty level, so adjust the difficulty to suit your skill level.

Another helpful tip is to use distractions to lure your target into a better shooting position. For example, if your target is in a crowded area, throw a coin to distract them and lure them to a less-crowded spot where you have a better shot.

Finally, don't forget to take your time and stay calm. This challenge requires patience and precision, so don't rush it. Take your time to line up your shot and don't get discouraged if you don't succeed on your first attempt.

In conclusion, the Keep Calm and Aim challenge in Hitman 3 is a tough but rewarding challenge. It's not found under mission-specific challenges, but instead categorised under Feats. Remember to take your time, stay calm and use distractions to lure your target into a better position.
