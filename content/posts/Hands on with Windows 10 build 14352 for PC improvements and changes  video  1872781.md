# Discover The Mind-Blowing Features Of Windows 10 Build 14352: A Hands-On Video That Will Change The Way You Use Your PC Forever!

Windows 10 has come a long way since its initial release, and Microsoft has been continuously working to improve it through updates and upgrades. One such upgrade is the Windows 10 Build 14352 that promises to change the way you use your PC forever. In this article, we will go through some of the mind-blowing features of this operating system that will make your workflow smoother and more efficient.

But before we dive into the features, we recommend watching the hands-on video by Windows Central that showcases the new features in detail.

## Cortana Enhancements

Cortana has been one of the most prominent features of Windows 10, and the new build brings several enhancements to make it even better. First, the personal assistant now has a more conversational interface that makes using it more natural. Also, Cortana can now schedule appointments and reminders directly from emails, which means you don't have to launch the calendar app separately.

The PC-to-PC calling feature, which was earlier only available in Skype, will now be available in Cortana. This is a great addition for people who like to make quick voice calls from their PC without having to open a separate application.

## Windows Ink

Windows Ink is a new platform that allows users to use a pen on their touch screen devices to jot down notes and sketches. It's a great feature for people who like to take handwritten notes but don't want to carry around a separate notebook or tablet. With Windows Ink, you can now turn your device into a digital notebook and start jotting down ideas, doodles, or even to-do lists.

The build also includes integration with Sticky Notes, which means you can now write a note with your pen and have it automatically synced to all your devices.

## Windows Hello Enhancements

Windows Hello is a biometric authentication system that allows users to log in to their devices using face recognition, fingerprint, or iris scan. The new build brings several enhancements to it, making it even more secure and reliable. For instance, Windows Hello now supports more devices, including external USB cameras, which means you can now use it on your desktop PC without having to invest in a specialized camera.

Windows Hello also supports dynamic lock, which means your PC will automatically lock itself when you're not around, and it detects that you've left. This feature is great for people who forget to lock their devices when sharing workspaces with others.

## Improved Settings App

The traditional Control Panel has been around for ages, but Microsoft has been slowly moving towards the modern Settings app with every update. The new build brings several improvements to the Settings app, making it even more functional and efficient. For instance, the app now supports nested pages, which means you can drill down into sub-menus for more options.

Also, the app now has a search bar that makes it easier to find specific settings. And you can now create custom folders in the app for easier navigation.

## Conclusion

Windows 10 Build 14352 is a significant update that brings several new features to the table. From the enhanced Cortana to the advanced Windows Ink and Windows Hello, working on Windows 10 has never been smoother or more efficient. So if you're a Windows user, we highly recommend upgrading to the latest build and taking advantage of these features.
