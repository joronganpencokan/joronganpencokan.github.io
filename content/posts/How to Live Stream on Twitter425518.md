The Twitter live stream feature is powered by Periscope, a separate service that's dedicated purely to broadcasting video. While the Periscope live video service is what makes streaming on Twitter possible, the Periscope app isn't needed to begin a broadcast from Twitter, so it does not need to be downloaded onto your smart device. All of this connectivity happens behind the scenes and is not something the average user needs to worry about.

 
To delete a previous Twitter live stream, all you need to do is delete the tweet that contains the video. This will delete the video on both Twitter and Periscope. Deleting a past live stream from within the Periscope app will not delete it on Twitter.
 

Periscope accounts are identical to Twitter accounts despite the different app name; following a user on one will follow them on the other. Periscope live streams will also broadcast on Twitter and vice versa.

 
While the Periscope live stream app isn't needed to broadcast from Twitter, it can be useful for finding other live streams to watch due to its improved search and discovery features.
