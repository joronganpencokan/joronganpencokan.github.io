Whether you prefer close-up combat or long-range attacks, Haohmaru has something for everyone.

One of Haohmaru's signature moves is his Dragonblaze attack, which sees him dash forward and deliver a flaming slash to his opponent.

His first super, the Tenha Seiou Zan, sees him deliver a massive overhead slash that sends his opponent flying. This move is great for finishing off opponents who are low on health, or for punishing opponents who are trying to rush in. His second super, the Issen, is even more devastating. This move sees him unleash a lightning-fast series of slashes that can deal incredible damage if all of the hits connect. This move is great for catching opponents off guard and can be used to take down even the toughest opponents.

In terms of combos, Haohmaru has a variety of different options that can be used to keep your opponent on their toes. His basic combo, which consists of a series of slashes and kicks, is great for dealing damage and setting up other moves. His Blade Combo is particularly effective, as it sees him deliver a quick three-hit combo that ends in a powerful finishing blow. This move is great for catching opponents off guard and can be used to quickly turn the tide of a battle.

Overall, Haohmaru is a fantastic addition to Soulcalibur VI's roster, and is sure to become a favorite among fans of the series.
