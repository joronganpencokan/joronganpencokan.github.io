Windows 11 includes an updated version of File Explorer with tabs that work similarly to how tabs work in web browsers.
 
The idea of the feature is simple. Instead of having multiple instances of File Explorer, you can now use one instance of the app to navigate multiple folders and drive locations. Also, you can create new or close open tabs, and the feature works in dark mode.
 
This guide will teach you the easy steps to get started with tabs on File Explorer for Windows 11.
 
## Manage tabs on File Explorer
 
On Windows 11 22H2 and higher releases, tabs should be enabled automatically. If not, you can use these steps to enable the feature on your computer.

- Drag a tab left or right to change its position.
 - Use the “Ctrl + Tab” keyboard shortcut to cycle through the open tabs.
 - If you have multiple tabs open, use the left and right buttons to scroll forward and backward through the tabs.
 - If you want to copy a file between folders, drag the file over the new tab and drop it in the new location. If you drag the file with the right-click, you will get the context menu with the options to copy or move the file.
