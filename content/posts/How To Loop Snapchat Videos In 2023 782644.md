# You Won't Believe How to Loop Your Snapchat Videos like a Pro in 2023 – Check Out These Game-Changing Tips!

## Introduction

As we step into the year 2023, Snapchat continues to be one of the most popular social media platforms, with millions of users sharing photos and videos every day. If you're a regular user of Snapchat, you might have noticed that some of the coolest snaps have videos that loop seamlessly, creating a mesmerizing effect. In this article, we'll take a look at how you can loop your Snapchat videos like a pro, using some game-changing tips.

## Tip #1: Shoot Videos in Short Bursts

The first tip to creating perfect looping videos on Snapchat is to shoot your videos in short bursts. Instead of shooting one long video that you intend to loop, try to break it down into smaller clips. Snapchat allows you to shoot videos in 10-second bursts, so you can shoot multiple clips and splice them together to create a longer video. Breaking down your video into small clips allows you to focus on getting each section right, ensuring that you don't waste time on a section that you'll end up cutting later.

## Tip #2: Pay Attention to the Start and End Points

The success of your looping video depends on the start and end points of your video. When you're shooting your video, make sure that you start and end at the same point. This will ensure that your video seamlessly loops back to the beginning without any noticeable changes. Additionally, make sure that your video doesn't contain any segments that abruptly end or begin, as this can make the loop feel disjointed.

## Tip #3: Utilize Snapchat's Looping Feature

Snapchat has a looping feature that allows you to loop your video directly on the platform. To use this feature, tap on your snap and then tap on the "loop" icon that appears at the bottom of the screen. This will loop your video endlessly, creating a mesmerizing effect that's sure to grab the attention of your followers.

## Tip #4: Use Video Editing Apps

If you want to take your looping game to the next level, consider using video editing apps like Boomerang or Loop Vid. These apps allow you to loop your videos in unique and creative ways, adding a fun twist to your snaps. Additionally, these apps offer a range of editing features that allow you to add filters, text, and other effects to your videos.

## Conclusion

Creating perfect looping videos on Snapchat requires some skill and attention to detail, but with these game-changing tips, you'll be able to create mesmerizing snaps that will leave your followers in awe. By shooting your videos in short bursts, paying attention to the start and end points, utilizing Snapchat's looping feature, and using video editing apps, you'll be able to take your looping game to the next level. So, get out there and start experimenting – who knows, your next looping snap could be the next viral sensation!

Have you ever used Instagram’s Boomerang and wanted to use the same on Snapchat? Well, both Boomerang and looping videos are quite similar in nature. The only difference is the video direction. In Instagram’s Boomerang, video switches its direction back and forth as soon as it ends, whereas Snapchat looping video keeps moving forward until someone closes it or moves to a different story.
 
However, with looping videos, there’s one more feature we’ll be discussing, and that is the Bounce feature of Snapchat. Snapchat’s Bounce feature is exactly similar to Instagram’s Boomerang. But unfortunately, this feature is only available on iOS, at least for now.
 
So if you want to use the loop or bounce feature, then here’s a quick guide for you.
 
## Make Loop Videos On Snapchat On Android And iPhone
 
Follow this step by step guide to make your first loop video on Snapchat. The steps are the same for both Android and iPhone.
 
Make sure to update your Snapchat app to the latest version. This feature won’t be available if you haven’t updated your app.
 
- Press and hold the circular shutter button to record a video. Releasing this button will stop shooting the video and you will be redirected to the video editing screen.The option for looping a video is present on the right sidebar as shown in the screenshot. The infinity symbol in the loop icon means that the video is set to loop until the recipient closes it. If you have turned off the loop then the loop icon will have 1 so the video will loop only once. Tap on it to change the loop to infinite.

 
3. After that, select where you want to send your video as usual. You can share it either with your friends or as your story.
 
And that’s it. You have created and shared your first looping video on Snapchat.
 
## Snapchat Bounce Effect On iPhone
 
As we’ve already mentioned, for now, this feature is only available for iPhone users. And that is really disappointing because this feature is actually similar and to some extent even better than Instagram’s Boomerang. And why is it better? Well, on Snapchat, you can record a full video using your usual snap camera and then set the duration of the Bounce manually. On the other hand, on Instagram, you have to use the boomerang camera if you want to record a boomerang video.
 
So, now without taking more of your time, let’s jump to the part where we’ll teach you how you can use Snapchat’s Bounce feature on iOS.
 
- First, you have to record a video as we’ve already discussed.After that, you have to double-tap on the loop icon to get the Bounce option.

 
3. Now, you’ll get the duration bar to set the duration of the bounce. You’ll see the preview of the bounce as you set a duration on the bar.
 
4. If you’re happy with the bounce, just click on send to set it as your story or to send it to your friends.
