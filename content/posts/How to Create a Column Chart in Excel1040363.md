# Unlock the Power of Data Visualization: Learn How to Create Stunning Column Charts in Excel Today!

Data visualization is an essential aspect of data analysis. It allows you to present complex information in a simple and easy-to-understand manner. One of the most popular ways of visualizing data is through column charts.

Column charts are simple and effective tools for demonstrating trends and patterns in data. They are easy to create in Excel and can help you communicate your findings with ease. In this article, we will show you how to create stunning column charts in Excel so you can unlock the power of data visualization.

## Step 1: Organize Your Data

The first step to creating a column chart is to organize your data properly. Your data should be organized in a way that makes sense and is easy to understand. Typically, your data will consist of categories and corresponding values. Let's take an example of sales data for different products in a month.

| Product | Sales|
|---------|------|
| A	      | 200  |
| B	      | 400  |
| C	      | 600  |
| D	      | 800  |
| E	      | 1000 |

## Step 2: Insert a Column Chart

Once you have organized your data, you can now insert a column chart. Here's how you can insert one in Excel:

1. Select the data range you want to include in the chart.
2. Navigate to the "Insert" tab in the Ribbon at the top of the page.
3. Select "Column" in the Charts section.
4. Choose the type of column chart you want to use. You can choose from Clustered Column, Stacked Column, 100% Stacked Column, and more.

## Step 3: Customize Your Column Chart

Now that you have inserted a column chart, you can customize it to suit your needs. There are several customization options available for column charts in Excel. Here are some of the most useful ones:

1. Add a chart title: A chart title can help you communicate the overall purpose of your chart.
2. Add axis titles: Axis titles can help you label your chart's axis clearly.
3. Change the chart type: If you're not happy with the column chart type you selected, you can always change it to a different one.
4. Customize the colors: You can change the colors of your column chart to make it more visually appealing.

## Step 4: Analyze Your Data

Once you have created your column chart, you can analyze your data. Column charts can help you identify trends and patterns in your data. You can also use your column chart to compare different categories of data. For example, in our sales data example, we can use the column chart to compare the sales of different products.

## Conclusion

Column charts are an effective way to visualize data quickly and easily. With Excel, you can create stunning column charts in minutes. We hope this article has helped you learn how to create a column chart in Excel and how to customize it to suit your needs. Remember, great data visualization is all about communicating your findings clearly and effectively. Good luck with your data analysis!

##   Create a Basic Excel Column Chart  
 

Entering the needed data into your spreadsheet is the first step in creating a chart. Begin by setting up a spreadsheet with your data, making sure to create a column for each category.

 

In the above example, the columns contain categories for Chocolate, Lemon, and Oatmeal cookies.

 

The steps below create a basic column chart. This is a plain, unformatted chart that displays your data, a basic legend, and a default chart title.

 
If you want to follow along with this tutorial, open a blank worksheet and enter the data shown in the image above.
 
- Highlight the range of cells that contain your data.
 - Select Insert.
 - In the Charts group, select the Insert Column or Bar Chart to open a list of available chart types.
 - Hover over a chart type to read a description of the chart and see a preview of how the chart will look with your data.
 - In the 2-D Column section of the list, choose Clustered Column to add this basic chart to the worksheet.

 
##   Replace the Basic Chart Title  
 

The chart may not have all the information you need to make it meaningful. Start by changing the chart title to something more descriptive.

 

Highlight the range of cells that contain your data.

 

Select Insert.

 

In the Charts group, select the Insert Column or Bar Chart to open a list of available chart types.

 

Hover over a chart type to read a description of the chart and see a preview of how the chart will look with your data.

 

In the 2-D Column section of the list, choose Clustered Column to add this basic chart to the worksheet.

 
Not sure what type of chart will look best with your data? Highlight the data and select Insert > Recommended Charts to see a list of suggestions.
 

Here's how to replace the chart title:

 
- Select the default chart title. A box appears around the words Chart Title.
 - Select the chart title a second time to put Excel in edit mode. This places the cursor inside the title box.
 - Delete the default text using the Backspace key.
 - Enter a new title.

 
##   Select Different Parts of the Chart  
 

There are many different parts to a chart in Excel. The plot area of a chart contains the selected data series, the legend, and the chart title. All of these parts are considered separate objects and each is formatted separately. You tell Excel which part of the chart you want to format by selecting it.

 

Select the default chart title. A box appears around the words Chart Title.

To create a chart title that is on two separate lines, press Enter to go from the first line to the second.
 

A common mistake is selecting the plot area in the center of the chart instead of selecting the entire chart. The easiest way to select the entire chart is to select a blank area at the top left or right corner of the chart.

 
If you make a mistake, quickly correct it using Excel's undo feature. After you remove the mistake, select the right part of the chart and try again.
 
##   Change the Chart Style  
 

When a chart is created in Excel, or whenever an existing chart is selected, two additional tabs are added to the ribbon as shown in the image below. These Chart Tools tabs, Design and Format, contain formatting and layout options specifically for charts.

 

These Chart Tools will be used in the following steps to format the column chart.
