Revolutionize Your Whatsapp Experience: Program Messages Ahead of Time Without Rooting Your Android Phone!

Are you tired of constantly checking your phone to send out important messages on Whatsapp? The constant interruption from your daily routine can be a huge hassle. However, there’s a solution to this problem that will revolutionize your Whatsapp experience. With the ability to program messages ahead of time, you can take the stress away from using the app.

First and foremost, to program messages on Whatsapp on an Android phone, you won’t need to root your device. Rooting your device can expose your information to risks and can be complicated. However, with the use of a third-party app, you can program your messages with ease.

The app called ‘SKEDit’ lets you program your Whatsapp messages ahead of time. Whether it’s a simple message reminder, a birthday wish or an urgent message for someone who’s out of reach, this app lets you send them on a timely schedule without you needing to be present.

Using the app is simple too. After downloading it, you’ll be prompted to grant a few permissions. Approving access to Whatsapp will allow SkedIt to access your contact list, see your incoming messages, and respond on your behalf. For instance, if you schedule a message and your recipient responds, SkedIt can automatically reply on your behalf.

Once you’ve granted permissions, you’re ready to start scheduling messages. The interface is user-friendly, so you don’t need to be tech-savvy to operate the app. The app has a step-by-step guide that will walk you through the process of crafting a message, scheduling the time and date, and selecting the recipient. This way, you can personalize and organize your messages according to your preference, letting you take control of your communication.

It’s worth noting that the app schedule messages via notifications. If you’re scheduling a message to a contact, who’s not on Whatsapp, the message will not be sent at the scheduled time. Moreover, if the recipient has blocked you, the message won't be delivered.

In conclusion, this app offers a solution to those who find it challenging to keep up with their Whatsapp communications. With SKEDit, you can schedule messages ahead of time, personalize it, and send them off when needed. It’s a helpful tool that’s perfect for busy individuals who don't want to be constantly interrupted by their mobile device. Try it today and revolutionize your Whatsapp Experience!

If you are notorious for missing important stuff like wishing your friends on their Birthdays or reminding your colleagues about the super important meeting then this is indeed a handy app.  One can also schedule it to send WhatsApp reminders for their loved ones to take medicine on time. Scheduler for WhatsApp is available on the Google Playstore and once installed you need to go through a bunch of basic settings, additionally if your phone runs on Android Marshmallow as the user you need to give the necessary permission.
WhatsApp Scheduler requires the accessibility access and this is something you can grant by going to the Settings menu. Go to Settings>Acessibility>WhatsApp Scheduler>Switch on.
The Schedule feature is well laid out, it lets you select the recipients, time, frequency of the messages and a field for you to enter the text. Sent messages are added to the usual thread. Once scheduled users can also delete the message. Unlike some of the other WhatsApp scheduler, this one doesn’t require root access. I tried scheduling a message and it wasn’t sent as scheduled. Only later did I realize the need to keep my phone unlocked in order to let the app send the WhatsApp messages. Additionally, the app also didn’t let me schedule a message on the same day and instead asked me to choose a “future date”. The bottom line is that the app works as claimed (barring a few small bugs here and there) and is probably the only WhatsApp scheduler in Android Playstore that doesn’t require a root access and works fine. I tried out the other Scheduler apps in the Playstore like this one and none of them worked as expected.
