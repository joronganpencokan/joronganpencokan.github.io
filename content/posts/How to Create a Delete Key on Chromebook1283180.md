# Say Goodbye to Keyboard Frustration: Unlock the Secret to Adding the 'Delete' Key on Your Chromebook!

If you have been using a Chromebook for some time now, you may have noticed that the keyboard is slightly different from traditional laptops or desktop systems. One of the most frustrating aspects of the Chromebook keyboard for many users is the absence of the 'Delete' key.

Unlike the 'Backspace' key, which deletes characters to the left of the cursor, the 'Delete' key deletes characters to the right of the cursor. It is an essential key that makes editing text, deleting files, or even navigating through web pages a breeze. This article will show you how to add the 'Delete' key to your Chromebook and say goodbye to keyboard frustration for good.

## Method 1: Using the Alt Key

The first method to enable the 'Delete' key on your Chromebook is to use a keyboard shortcut involving the 'Alt' key. Here's how:

1. Press and hold the 'Alt' key located on the bottom left of your keyboard.
2. While holding down the 'Alt' key, press the 'Backspace' key at the top right of your keyboard.
3. Voila! You have just unlocked the 'Delete' key.

Using this method, you can easily delete characters to the right of the cursor without having to use the 'Backspace' key repeatedly.

## Method 2: Reassigning the Search Key

If you are not a fan of using keyboard shortcuts, you can also reassign the 'Search' key to act as the 'Delete' key. Here's how:

1. Click on the 'Settings' icon on your Chromebook.
2. Scroll down and click on 'Device' followed by 'Keyboard.'
3. Under the 'Keyboard' section, click on the 'Modifiers' option.
4. Next, click on the drop-down menu next to the 'Search' key and select 'Delete.'
5. Finally, click on the 'OK' button to save the changes.

Using this method, you can seamlessly use the 'Search' key as the 'Delete' key, making editing and deleting files a lot easier.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, not having a 'Delete' key on your Chromebook can be frustrating, but there are two easy ways to remedy this issue. Whether you prefer using keyboard shortcuts or reassigning keys, you can now say goodbye to keyboard frustration and enjoy a more efficient computing experience. Try out these methods today and see how much easier editing and deleting can be on your Chromebook.

This article explains how to create a Chromebook delete key function and use key combinations to make up for other missing Chromebook keys.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- To mimic the Delete key, use the keyboard shortcut Alt+Backspace, or right-click an item and select Delete from the context menu. Missing keys: Home (Ctrl+Alt+Up Arrow), End (Ctrl+Alt+Down Arrow), Page Up (Search+Up Arrow), Page Down (Search+Down Arrow).To map a function to a key, click Time > Settings > Device > Keyboard and click a key's drop-down menu to select another function.

 
##   How to Delete on Chromebook  
 

To mimic the Delete key’s functionality on Chrome OS, you can use the following keyboard shortcut: Alt+Backspace. This key combo can be pressed for a number of different reasons, such as deleting a file or erasing the character to the right (or in front of) your blinking cursor. 

 

In contrast, the Backspace key is essentially the Chromebook Delete key and you can use it without any additional keys to delete the character to the left (or behind) your cursor. 

 

In other instances, such as when you’re dealing with files or even a selected block of text, you can right-click the item you wish to remove, then select Delete from the context menu. 

 
##   Other Chromebook Shortcuts  
 

In addition to Delete, there are other keys found on traditional keyboards that may not be available on a standard Chromebook. Thankfully, most of these missing keys can also be mimicked by using the following shortcuts. 

 
- Home: Ctrl+Alt+Up ArrowEnd: Ctrl+Alt+Down ArrowPage Up: Alt or Search+Up ArrowPage Down: Alt or Search+Down Arrow

 
##   How to Create Custom Keys on Chromebook  
 

While you can’t create a custom Delete key on your Chromebook, you do have the option of mapping some other functions to a number of existing keys.
