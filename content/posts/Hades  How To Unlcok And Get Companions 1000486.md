# Unleash the Power of Darkness: Learn How to Unlock Unique Companions in Hades!

If you're a fan of the hack-and-slash genre, you'll absolutely love Hades. This action-packed game, developed by Supergiant Games, presents a unique twist on the Greek mythos while also being one of the most challenging action games you'll ever play. One of the elements that makes Hades so exciting is the concept of companions. Companions are powerful beings that can aid you on your journey through the underworld. However, you can't access all of them from the get-go.

In this article, we'll show you how to unlock some of the most impressive companions in Hades by using the power of darkness. The darkness is one of the in-game resources that you'll gather along your journey, and it's essential to help you unlock the potential of your companions.

## The Importance of Companions

In Hades, you play as Zagreus, the son of Hades, who's on a mission to escape the underworld. Along your challenging journey, you'll fight many foes who are trying to bring you down. That's where companions come in. In Hades, they're called "boons" and are powerful enhancements that can increase your damage, provide you with extra abilities to help you defeat enemies, and give you a considerable advantage.

## Companions in Hades

To activate companions, you must first acquire them. You can use darkness, the in-game resource, to unlock new companions. There are various companions in Hades, including gods, goddesses, and mythical creatures. Here are some of the most powerful companions:

### Sisyphus

To unlock Sisyphus, you'll need to earn yourself a hefty sum of darkness, and then find him idle and waiting during your escape attempts. He’ll give you an item that will increase your health, so that you can stay in the game for longer.

### Megaera

Megaera, one of the three furies, is a formidable foe that you must defeat as a boss. After you defeat her, you can use 500 darkness to unlock her, and she will spawn mini-furies that can attack nearby enemies.

### Patroclus

To unlock Patroclus, you need to defeat Theseus in a boss battle, then use 1000 darkness at the House of Hades bar after his dialogue unlocks. Patroclus is a fierce fighter with a powerful sweeping attack.

### Thanatos

Thanatos, the god of death, is one of the most powerful companions in Hades. To unlock him, you must use 15 keys to unlock a contract at the House of Hades bulletin board, then meet him during your escape attempts. Once you unlock him, he'll help you take down enemies and give you an extra life.

## Conclusion

Companions are an essential element of Hades, and they can either make or break your success in the game. With the right companions, you can overpower your enemies, and with the wrong ones, you can find yourself struggling to stay alive. However, unlocking companions can be time-consuming and require strategy. That's where the darkness comes in. Use this in-game resource wisely and unlock some of the most formidable companions in all of Hades.
