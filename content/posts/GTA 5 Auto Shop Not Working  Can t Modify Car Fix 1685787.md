Title: Revamp Your GTA 5 Driving Experience: Learn How to Fix the Auto Shop and Customize Your Dream Ride

GTA 5 is an open-world game, with a vast range of customizations to make your gameplay an absolute bliss. One such feature is the ability to customize your car – make your ride unique, add some personality and ramp up the aesthetics for an exhilarating driving experience. However, imagine the disappointment of players when they cannot access the Auto Shop or face glitches when using it. To your relief, in this article, we aim to solve that issue and provide you with a step-by-step guide to fully utilize the Auto Shop feature.

Step 1: Update the Game

The Auto Shop feature was introduced in the downloadable content (DLC) “Los Santos Tuners” released in 2021, which added a new mechanic’s shop in the game called, “LS Car Meet.” However, it is crucial to ensure that your game is updated to access the features. Look for the latest patches and updates on your gaming platform, download and install them.

Step 2: Accessing the LS Car Meet

To access the LS Car Meet, you must have reached the rank of Street Racing Participant in the game’s Street Racing series (SR). Once you hit this achievement, a notification will pop up, directing you to the LS Car Meet located in Cypress Flats.

Step 3: Working with the Auto Shop

Upon entering the LS Car Meet, you will find yourself in a car enthusiast’s haven where you can meet players, participate in races, and utilize the Auto Shop. To access the Auto Shop, head to the mechanic’s station, where you will be prompted with a menu showcasing a range of customization options:

1. Modify Performance: Here, you can update the engine, suspension, and brakes of your car to improve its performance.

2. Cosmetics: This section allows you to add styling and visual upgrades to your car, such as spoilers, bumpers, and paint jobs.

3. Wheels: Change your rims, tires, and colors to add flair to your ride.

4. Sound: Here, you can customize your car's engine sound to give it that extra oomph.

5. Neons: Add neon lights under your car to make it stand out.

Step 4: Making the Most of Auto Shop

To make the most of the Auto Shop and customization options, it is recommended to have a fully upgraded car. It can help improve your car's performance and make it easier to complete jobs, missions, and races in the game. Also, participating in Street Races and LS Car Meet events will enable you to earn more money, unlock parts, and level up your account, opening up more exciting customization options.

Conclusion:

GTA 5’s Auto Shop feature is a fantastic addition to the game that can make your driving experience more exciting and unique. Players can access this feature by updating their game, reaching the rank of Street Racing Participant, and visiting the LS Car Meet. The Auto Shop allows you to customize aspects of your car like performance, cosmetics, wheels, and more, providing endless opportunities to create your dream ride. So revamp your GTA 5 driving experience and start customizing your ride now!
