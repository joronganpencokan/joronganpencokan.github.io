If you have ever taken a picture with your iPhone or iPad, you may have noticed that the default image format is HEIC (High Efficiency Image Format). While this format offers some benefits, such as smaller file sizes and better quality, it can be a hassle to share or view these images on non-Apple devices. Fortunately, converting HEIC files to JPG is easier than you might think, especially if you are using a Windows computer.

There are different software options available to convert HEIC files to JPG, but we will focus on the easiest and most accessible method.

## Method 1: Use the Microsoft Photos App

The Microsoft Photos app is a built-in Windows tool that not everyone knows about. It is commonly used to view and manage photos on your device, but it also offers a quick way to convert HEIC files to JPG.

Follow these simple steps:

1. Open the Microsoft Photos app by searching for it in the Start Menu or pressing the Windows key + S and typing "Photos."

2. Once the app is open, click on the picture you want to convert.

3. Click on the "..." menu icon located at the top-right corner of the app and select "Save as."

4. A dialog box will appear. Make sure to choose "JPG" as your file type and select the folder where you want to save the converted file. Click "Save" to confirm.

5. The conversion may take a few seconds, depending on the size of the file. Once it is done, you will find the JPG version of your image in the selected folder.

There you have it! With just a few clicks, you can convert any HEIC image to JPG using the Microsoft Photos app. This method is perfect if you are not frequently converting HEIC files, or if you prefer to use native Windows software.

But what if you need to convert multiple files at once? You may want to consider another tool.

## Method 2: Use a Third-Party Software

There are several third-party applications designed to deal with HEIC files, but one of the most popular is CopyTrans HEIC for Windows. This is a free program that enables you to convert HEIC files to JPG in bulk.

Here is how to use it:

1. Download the tool from the CopyTrans HEIC for Windows website and install it on your computer.

2. Once installed, select any number of HEIC files you want to convert.

3. Right-click on the selected files and choose "Convert to JPEG using CopyTrans."

4. A new window will pop up. Here, you can adjust various conversion settings, such as the output folder, image quality, and resizing options.

5. Click on "Start" to begin the conversion process.

6. When it is done, you will find the converted JPG files in the chosen output folder.

CopyTrans HEIC for Windows is a great option if you need to batch-convert several HEIC files to JPG regularly. However, keep in mind that it is not the only alternative out there. Do your own research to find the best tool that suits your needs.

##   Why Convert HEIC Files to JPG  
 

If HEIC files are better than JPG files, why convert them?

 
For security reasons, it's recommended you don't use it for private family photos. The website states it deletes files after an hour, but uploading anything should always be approached cautiously. 
 

Via your web browser, go to https://heic2jpeg.com

 

Select Upload Files, then choose the file you want to convert.

 

Wait for the file to finish converting.

 

Compatibility is a big part of the reason here. Not all image editing software is compatible with HEIC files (including Adobe Photoshop) and it's far easier to manipulate JPG files.

 

Some web browsers also can't view HEIC files, favoring traditional JPGs. Similarly, older operating systems, as well as different ones such as Chrome OS, don't play well with HEIC files. It's best to be able to convert these files to something everyone can see and use. 

 
Emailing files through the iOS Mail app will automatically convert HEIC files to JPG. It's often the easiest way of doing it.
