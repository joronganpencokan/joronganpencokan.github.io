# Gamers Beware! Halo MCC Multiplayer Crashes & Burns - Here's the Ultimate Fix!

Are you a fan of Halo games? Do you constantly face multiplayer crashes and issues while playing the Halo Master Chief Collection (MCC)? It can be frustrating and ruin your gaming experience. But, worry not! We've got the ultimate fix for you!

The Halo MCC is a remastered compilation of the earlier Halo games. It is a popular game among players worldwide. However, many users encounter multiplayer crashes and glitches that make playing the game difficult.

There is no one specific issue that is causing the problem. It could be due to outdated drivers, graphic card issues, or network problems. However, there are some solutions that can help you fix the problem.

## Update Drivers and Operating System

One of the issues you might face during multiplayer games is outdated drivers. It is essential to keep your graphics card and other hardware up to date. You can check your manufacturer websites for the latest drivers and updates.

Similarly, it would help if you also kept your operating system updated. The latest updates may fix some bugs and glitches that affect your gaming experiences.

## Check Your Network Settings

Another reason for multiplayer crashes could be network issues. Check your internet connection and speed. Low internet speed and high latency can cause lags and disconnections. If you're playing on Wi-Fi, try switching to a wired connection for better stability.

## Repair or Reinstall the Game

If the above steps fail, try repairing or reinstalling the game. Many gamers found that the issues were resolved by repairing the MCC files.

To repair the game, open the Microsoft Store, and click on the three dots on the upper right corner. Select "Downloads and updates" and click on Halo MCC. Select the "Advanced options" and click on "Repair."

If repairing doesn't work, uninstall the game and reinstall it.

## Investigate the Game Files

The next step would be to investigate the game files. One possible issue is that the game files are corrupted. To check this, you need to open the MCC files and verify them.

To do this, go to the Microsoft Store, and click on the three dots on the upper right corner. Select "Downloads and updates" and click on Halo MCC. Select the "Advanced options" and click on "App settings." Click on the "Reset" button under "Reset the app."

## Conclusion

With the above solutions, you can fix the Halo MCC multiplayer crashes and glitches. Don't let technical problems ruin your gaming experience. Stay up to date with the latest drivers and operating systems, check your network settings, repair or reinstall the game, and investigate the game files.

Happy gaming!


Halo Infinite’s multiplayer is out but MCC is still going strong and it will be like that for a long time to come. Players who grew up with these games refuse to part ways with it and with such a large player base and so many maps and modes to choose from, the game is pretty much a one-stop-shop for everything Halo., So, naturally it can get annoying if you feel like throwing down in classic maps and game modes and the game suddenly decides to not work. Let’s take a look at some of those reasons and find potential fixes for the Halo Master Chief Collection multiplayer not working issue.
 
## Halo Master Chief Collection (MCC) Multiplayer Not Working Fix
 
Just like every other multiplayer game, one of the primary reasons for MCC Multiplayer to not work can be a server-side issue or server maintenance. 343 Industries are pretty quick in fixing server-side issues and keeps the community posted with updates. In the case of maintenance, they inform the players well in advance when and for how long the maintenance will take place.
 

 
With that out of the way, here are a few other reasons –
 
- There could be some problems with your network so try restarting your router and see if it fixed the issue, if not then try contacting your ISP.
 - Your NAT type may be Strict and that’s a no-no for any and every online game in most cases. Try getting your NAT to Open and if that doesn’t work on your own then contact your ISP once again.
 - Try restarting your game, your console, or your router and see if it brings any change.
 - Matchmaking is mostly region-based(servers in your area) at first then it expands into the grander scale, so there may be a possibility of not many active players playing the game on your server and that causing delays and you not being able to find matches. You can use a VPN to fix that issue.
 - Finally, Xbox Live itself may be facing some problems and that could be the reason behind your bad multiplayer experience. You can check the status of Xbox Live on Microsoft’s website and see for yourself if there are any issues.

 
These have been some of the potential issues that plague the multiplayer land of Halo Master Chief Collection. Problems are situational and so are their solutions so I hope some of the fixes come in handy in your case. If so, then you can check out other articles here at GamerTweak.
