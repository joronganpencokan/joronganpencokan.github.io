Shocking Secret Revealed: HBO Go and HBO Now Aren't the Same Thing?! Discover the Game-Changing Differences Now!

Have you ever found yourself confused about the difference between HBO Go and HBO Now? If so, you're not alone. The two streaming services are often thought of as interchangeable, but in reality, they are quite different. If you're a fan of HBO programming and you're not quite sure which service is right for you, read on to discover the game-changing differences between the two.

HBO Go: A Service for Cable Subscribers

HBO Go is an authenticated streaming service that is only available to cable subscribers who have an HBO subscription. In other words, if you pay for HBO as part of your cable package, you can access HBO Go. The service allows you to stream all of HBO's original programming, along with a selection of movies, documentaries, and sports programming. You can access HBO Go on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, computers, and smart TVs.

HBO Now: A Stand-Alone Streaming Service

HBO Now, on the other hand, is a stand-alone streaming service that is available to anyone, regardless of whether or not they have a cable subscription. It offers the same selection of programming as HBO Go, but without the need for a cable subscription. Instead, you pay a monthly fee directly to HBO for access to the service. Like HBO Go, you can access HBO Now on a variety of devices.

So, What Are the Key Differences Between HBO Go and HBO Now?

The most obvious difference between the two services is that HBO Go is only available to cable subscribers, while HBO Now can be accessed by anyone. However, there are a few other differences you should be aware of.

Firstly, HBO Go allows you to access live programming, while HBO Now does not. If you want to stream live events like sports games or awards shows, you'll need to use HBO Go. Additionally, HBO Go is slightly more versatile when it comes to device compatibility. While HBO Now is available on most of the same devices as HBO Go, there are a few exceptions. For example, HBO Now is not currently available on gaming consoles like Xbox or PlayStation.

Finally, there is the issue of cost. If you already have an HBO subscription as part of your cable package, then HBO Go is technically free. However, if you don't have a cable subscription or you want access to HBO programming on the go, then HBO Now is generally the more cost-effective option.

The Bottom Line

HBO Go and HBO Now are not the same thing. If you're a cable subscriber who wants access to HBO programming on the go or on a variety of devices, then HBO Go is the service for you. However, if you don't have a cable subscription and you want to access HBO programming, then HBO Now is your best bet. Regardless of which service you choose, you can't go wrong with HBO's incredible selection of original programming.

It's possible to stream movies, series, and specials from the HBO content library on any app-enabled device, be it a phone, laptop, smart TV, streaming stick, or set-top box. All you need is one of HBO's two streaming services: HBO NOW or HBO GO.

 
HBO Go and HBO Now have been discontinued. HBO Max replaced HBO Go. HBO Now is now called HBO. HBO Max offers all the same content as the HBO app, plus a massive library of content from other Warner Media properties. This article exists for archival purposes.
 
##   Overall Findings  
 
- A standalone streaming service.
 - Access all HBO content.
 - Recalls watch history and continues play where you left off.

 
- Requires an HBO cable or satellite subscription.
 - Access all HBO content.
 - Recalls watch history and continues play where you left off.

 

If you have an HBO subscription, you can use HBO GO to watch HBO shows and movies on your phone, tablet, computer, or another app-enabled device. If you don't have a subscription, there is no way to get HBO GO. That's why HBO NOW is ideal for cord-cutters.

 

One problem for cord-cutters is that there are many services, including cable replacements like Sling TV and general streaming services like Netflix, that it's easy to pay as much, or more, for streaming services than for cable.

 
##   Price: Depends on Cost of Cable Package  
 

A bit more expensive than Netflix, HBO NOW costs $14.99 per month. That may save you money when compared to the cost of a premium cable subscription. However, you need to factor in the benefits of cable TV (and the other channels and DVR features available with it) when assessing the overall value of HBO NOW vs. HBO GO.

 
- $14.99 per month.

 
- Included with a premium cable or satellite subscription.

 
##   Access: Anyone, Anywhere vs. Cable Subscribers  
 
- A standalone streaming service that doesn't require an existing cable or satellite package.

 

HBO GO can also be viewed on any device with the app, but it only exists for paid cable subscribers. It is only available to people who subscribe to HBO through a cable or satellite package. If you have an HBO subscription, HBO GO is free. If you don't have an HBO subscription, HBO GO isn't an option.

 
##   Content: Same Content, Different Subscription  
 

HBO NOW and HBO GO include the same content. That includes all of HBO's original shows, from The Sopranos to Game of Thrones. It also includes all the movies that HBO currently has the rights to broadcast and stream.

 
- Same content as HBO, but with no live feed.

 

HBO NOW and HBO GO don't include a live feed of the HBO channel. Most shows become available to stream on the service around the time a show is broadcast on the HBO channel, but there is no option to watch a live stream of the channel.

 
##   Final Verdict: Get HBO NOW if You Don't Have Cable  
 

Since HBO NOW only provides access to HBO content, it falls into a category similar to streaming services like Paramount+. These kinds of single-channel subscriptions can build up your entertainment bills. The appeal comes down to your taste and preference. For many cord-cutters, HBO is worth paying $15 a month.

 
HBO adds new movies and rotates out older movies every month throughout the year. Along with recently released movies that aren't available on other streaming services, HBO regularly includes older movies in its rotation.
