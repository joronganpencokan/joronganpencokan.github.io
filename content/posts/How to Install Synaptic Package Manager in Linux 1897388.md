Synaptic Package Manager was once the default package manager for nearly all Debian-based Linux distributions. To date, it remains one of the most versatile package managers. Although it remains dated, many users still prefer it because of its simplicity.
 
In this tutorial, we show you how to install and use Synaptic Package Manager on Linux.
 
## Why Use Synaptic Package Manager?
 
The Synaptic Package Manager is a graphical package manager based on Advanced Package Tool (APT). It is one of the most popular graphical front-ends for the APT package management system used in Debian and its derivatives. 
 
Synaptic Package Manager is a great alternative to the Ubuntu Software Center, or any similar software center, for two reasons. First, Synaptic gives you access to all the software that you would find in your software center, plus extra software. Second, it gives you much more control over what you install on your computer. Choose to install specific versions of packages, select which dependencies should be installed, and more.
 
Tip: if your Ubuntu Software Center is not working, we have the fixes here.
 
## How to Install Synaptic Package Manager
 
For this guide, we are installing Synaptic Package Manager on Kali Linux, though the steps will work for all Debian-based Linux distros too.

If you are new to the terminal, this Linux commandline cheatsheet is all you need.

## Using Synaptic Package Manager
 
Installing, removing and upgrading packages are some of the basic capabilities of Synaptic. You can also upgrade your system, view installed packages, edit the list of used repositories and fix broken package dependencies.
 
### Installing New Packages
 
Synaptic Package Manager offers one of the easiest ways to install new packages. (Make use of these methods to determine if a package is already installed.)
 
- Launch the Synaptic Package Manager from the Applications menu.
 - Click on “Search” to search for the package you wish to install.

 
- Enter the name of the package you want to install. For illustration purposes, we are installing BrewTarget, a simple GUI calculator for estimating ingredients when brewing beer.

 
- Click on “Search” to initiate the search. The app will list potential search results. Right-click on the package you wish to install and select “Mark for Installation.” Click “Apply.”

 
- You will be asked to confirm that you want to apply the marked changes. Click “Apply.”

 
The installation will take a few minutes, then you will be presented with a pop-up that says, “Changes applied.”
 
### Removing Packages
 
Like the installation process, removing packages is also pretty simple with the Synaptic Package Manager.
 
- Under the Status Tab, choose the “Installed” option. This will display all installed packages.

 
- Scroll over to the package you wish to uninstall. Right-click it and select “Mark for Removal.”

 
- Click on “Apply.”

 
- Synaptic will ask you to confirm that you want to apply the changes. Click “Apply.”

 
The process will take less than a minute, and you will receive a success message.

### Upgrading Packages
 
- The first step to upgrading all of your packages using Synaptic is to click on the “Reload” button. Essentially, this button reloads all package information.

 
- Click on “Mark All Upgrades.”

 
- The package manager will ask whether you want to apply the changes. Click “Apply.” The upgrading process will take anywhere between a few seconds to half an hour, depending on your Internet speed and update size.

 
### Fixing Broken Dependencies
 
Compared to the tasks outlined above, this is the simplest.
 
- On the Edit tab, select “Fix Broken Packages.”

 
Synaptic Package Manager will automatically fix all broken dependencies. If successful, you should get a “Successfully fixed dependency problems” at the bottom of Synaptic’s window.
