Yahoo Mail Secret Revealed: Learn the Simple Trick to Inserting Images in Your Emails!

If you’re a Yahoo Mail user, you might have found it frustrating to try to add images to your emails. It’s not as intuitive as it seems, and you might have even given up and just sent the image as an attachment. But fear not, because there is a simple trick to inserting images in your Yahoo Mail emails.

Step 1: Find the image you want to insert

The first step is to find the image you want to insert. This can be from your computer or from your phone. Just make sure you have the image saved to a location you can easily find.

Step 2: Open your Yahoo Mail composer

Next, you’ll want to open your Yahoo Mail composer. This is where you’ll type up your email and insert your image. If you haven’t done so already, log in to your Yahoo Mail account and click “Compose.”

Step 3: Insert the image

This is where the trick comes in. Instead of clicking on the “Insert Image” button, which might not work, you’ll want to drag and drop the image file into the body of the email. Simply find the image file on your computer or phone and drag it into the email where you’d like it to appear.

Step 4: Confirm and send your email

Once the image is inserted where you want it, you can check to make sure it looks good by previewing your email. If everything looks good, you can hit “Send” and your email with the inserted image will be on its way.

In conclusion, inserting images into Yahoo Mail emails doesn’t have to be a frustrating experience. By simply dragging and dropping the image into the email body, you can add visuals to your messages in a snap. Give it a try and see how much faster and easier it is to add images to your Yahoo Mail emails!

While you can send any image as an attachment using Yahoo Mail, it's also possible to insert inline images into a Yahoo Mail message using the rich text editor. That way, the image appears alongside your text, and recipients don't have to download any files to view the images.

 
##   Copy and Paste an Inline Image Into Yahoo Mail  
 

The easiest method is to copy the image and paste it into your message.

 
Instructions in this article apply to the standard web version of Yahoo Mail and the Yahoo Mail mobile app for iOS and Android.
 
- Right-click the image and select Copy.
 - Alternatively, click the image and press Ctrl+C (for Windows) or Command+C (for Mac) to copy it.
 - Right-click inside the Yahoo Mail message where you want the image to go and select Paste.
 - Alternatively, click where you want the image to go, then press Ctrl+V (for Windows) or Command+V (for Mac) to paste it.
 - Hover the mouse over the image and select the ellipses (...) located in the upper-right corner of the image to adjust the size of the image.
 - Enter text before or after the image to add context.

 
##   Drag-and-Drop an Inline Image Into Yahoo Mail  
 

You can also drag-and-drop an image from the web or your computer into your Yahoo Mail message.

 

Right-click the image and select Copy.

 
Alternatively, click the image and press Ctrl+C (for Windows) or Command+C (for Mac) to copy it.
 

Right-click inside the Yahoo Mail message where you want the image to go and select Paste.

 
Alternatively, click where you want the image to go, then press Ctrl+V (for Windows) or Command+V (for Mac) to paste it.
 

Hover the mouse over the image and select the ellipses (...) located in the upper-right corner of the image to adjust the size of the image.

 

Enter text before or after the image to add context.

 
You can include as many inline images as you want so long as your message is less than 25 MB in total size.
 
- Open the website or folder where the image is located, and position the page side-by-side with Yahoo Mail.
 - Drag the image into the body of the message.
 - Release the mouse button to paste the image inside the message. Then, adjust the image size and add text.

 
##   Use Inline Images in the Yahoo Mail App  
 

Adding inline images to messages you send from the Yahoo Mail mobile app is even easier. While composing a message:

 

Open the website or folder where the image is located, and position the page side-by-side with Yahoo Mail.

 

Drag the image into the body of the message.

 

Release the mouse button to paste the image inside the message. Then, adjust the image size and add text.

 
- Tap the plus (+) located in the lower-right corner.
 - In the toolbar that appears, tap the picture icon.
 - Tap your image to select it, then tap Attach.
 - Even though you are selecting Attach, the image will appear inline.
 - While you can't adjust the size of the image, you can add text before or after it.

 
##   Why Use Inline Images?  
 

Using inline images can make your messages easier to understand. For example, when you share several pictures and write descriptions for each photo in the body of the text and send the pictures as attachments, the recipient could be confused about which text refers to which image. With inline images, you can add text before and after each picture to give it context, and the images display as the reader scrolls through the message.

 

Tap the plus (+) located in the lower-right corner.

 

In the toolbar that appears, tap the picture icon.

 

Tap your image to select it, then tap Attach.

 
Even though you are selecting Attach, the image will appear inline.
 

While you can't adjust the size of the image, you can add text before or after it.

 

Another benefit is that the recipient doesn't have to download anything, so they don't have to save the file to their computer. If they want to download the images, they can right-click the inline image and choose Save image as.
