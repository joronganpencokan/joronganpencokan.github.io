# Transform Your USB Drive Into a Powerhouse: Install VirtualBox and Run Any OS on the Go!

Do you travel a lot or need to use multiple operating systems? Do you want to be able to test software on different OSs without having to buy multiple computers? VirtualBox is a free and open source software that allows you to run multiple operating systems on one computer, and it can be installed on a USB drive so you can take it with you wherever you go.

## What is VirtualBox?

VirtualBox is software that allows you to run multiple operating systems on one computer. It is developed by Oracle and is available for free on their website. VirtualBox creates a virtual environment on your computer, allowing you to run another operating system without affecting your current one.

VirtualBox is great for developers who need to test their applications on different operating systems, or for people who need to use a specific operating system for a specific task. Additionally, it allows you to run older operating systems that may no longer be supported on your current hardware.

## Installing VirtualBox on a USB Drive

To install VirtualBox on a USB drive, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of VirtualBox from the Oracle website.

2. Insert your USB drive into your computer and format it as NTFS.

3. Open the VirtualBox installer and select "Custom Installation".

4. Choose "Install USB Support" and select your USB drive as the installation location.

5. Follow the prompts to install VirtualBox onto your USB drive.

## Running an OS on VirtualBox

Once you have installed VirtualBox on your USB drive, you can run any operating system you want. Here are the steps to run an OS on VirtualBox:

1. Open VirtualBox from your USB drive.

2. Click "New" to create a new virtual machine.

3. Choose the operating system you want to install and set the parameters for the virtual machine, such as how much RAM and hard drive space to allocate.

4. Insert the installation media for the operating system you want to install, such as a CD or USB drive.

5. Follow the prompts to install the operating system onto the virtual machine.

6. Once the operating system is installed, you can use it just like you would on a regular computer.

## Benefits of Running VirtualBox on a USB Drive

There are many benefits to running VirtualBox on a USB drive. These include:

1. Portability: You can take your virtual machines with you wherever you go.

2. Cost-effective: You don't need to buy multiple computers to run different operating systems.

3. Flexibility: You can run any operating system you want, regardless of whether it is supported on your current hardware.

4. Safety: Running an OS on a virtual machine is much safer than running it on your actual hardware.

## Conclusion

VirtualBox is a powerful tool that can help you run multiple operating systems on one computer, and installing it on a USB drive makes it even more powerful. Whether you're a developer who needs to test applications on different operating systems, or you just need to run a specific operating system for a specific task, VirtualBox on a USB drive is a great solution. So the next time you're on the go, don't leave home without your VirtualBox USB drive!

As we walk in the year 2010, Operating systems are not machine specific anymore. Google chrome OS has launched which marks a new era in the beginning of cloud based Operating system. But sometimes the cloud can be a little difficult to maintain, especially when you prefer using a USB stick for doing your day to day tasks with the computer, taking backups, moving files and working in multiple computers like in Office, home or may be some other place.
 
Thus sometimes you may need an operating system that would be portable, so that you can run it from your removable drive and from any computer. We have covered Mojopack earlier, which lets you carry a “self made system environment” in your USB drive. But Mojopack is not any operating system and it depends upon the host computer where you would be using it.
 
What if we could install and carry an operating system of our choice from the USB drive?
 
The answer: Virtual box made portable. The idea here is to install Virtualbox in your USB drive and use it to install a guest operating system. With this portable virtual disk, you can use this system in any computer you want.
 
## How to Make VirtualBox Portable
 
1. To install Virtualbox in your removable drive, go to vbox and download the package (957 Kb). Choose the version 3.0 as shown below.
 
2. Run the set up and it will ask you for a location to unzip the files. Extract all the files to your USB drive.
 
3. The setup will extract all the files required to set up virtualbox in your USB drive. Now open the “Portable-Virtualbox” folder from the removable drive and double click the set up file as shown below.
 
4. Now you will be shown something like this
 
5. Select the checkboxes “Extract the files for a 32 bit system” and “Extract the files for a 64 bit system“. You can also choose to compress the files to save some precious space in your removable drive.
 
6. That’s it. Click the “Download Installation file for Virtualbox” button.
 
7. Immediately after that, you will see that the application has started downloading the setup files required to install portable Virtualbox. Wait for the download to finish. You will see a notification right in the middle of the screen and also in the system tray.
 
8. It would take some time to download the Virtualbox files. After the download is over, you will see a prompt as shown below
 
9. Now open your removable drive again and you would see a new icon named as “Virtual Box” (not to be confused with Portable Virtualbox icon). Double click it and you will see the usual Virtualbox wizard.
 
Complete the wizard and you are done with the installation part of portable Virtualbox in the removable drive.
 
### Install a Portable Operating System in your Removable Drive
 
Now that Virtualbox is in your removable drive, you can easily create a virtual hard disk and install any operating system such as Windows XP, Windows Vista, Linux etc. Start the virtual Box program and you can create a virtual hard disk. Save this hard disk in your removable drive as you would be using it from the USB drive only.
 
Once you are done with the installation part you can carry the Operating system in the removable drive and use it on multiple computers. That concludes the tutorial on installing a portable operating system in your USB stick.
 
## Advantages
 
There are a lot of advantages of using a portable Virtualbox hard disk and running an operating system with it. The biggest advantage is that you can run the OS on any computer which does not have virtual box installed. Another major advantage is keeping your hard disk free from virtual hard disks or you may even copy the virtual hard disk from one computer to another.
