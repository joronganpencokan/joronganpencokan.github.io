If you own a Redmi Note 8 Pro, you probably know how frustrating it can be to constantly charge your phone. With its large display and powerful processors, it's no surprise that the battery life can be lacking. However, there are hidden settings that can help you extend your battery life and keep your phone running for longer. In this article, we will show you how to unlock the secret to boosting your Redmi Note 8 Pro's battery life!

1. Turn on battery saver

The first step to improving your Redmi Note 8 Pro's battery life is to turn on battery saver. This is a built-in feature that can help prolong the life of your battery by limiting background app refresh and reducing screen brightness. To turn on battery saver, go to Settings > Battery & performance > Battery saver. From here, you can choose to turn on battery saver automatically when your battery reaches a certain percentage, or you can manually turn it on.

2. Disable auto-sync

Another way to save battery life is to disable auto-sync for apps that you don't need to be constantly updated. This includes apps like weather, stocks, and news. To do this, go to Settings > Accounts & sync > Auto-sync data. From here, you can choose to turn off auto-sync for specific apps, or you can turn it off altogether.

3. Reduce screen timeout

Having your screen on for extended periods of time can quickly drain your battery. To avoid this, reduce your screen timeout to the shortest amount of time possible. To do this, go to Settings > Display > Sleep. From here, you can choose the length of time before your screen turns off. We recommend setting it to 30 seconds or less.

4. Disable vibrations

Vibrations are a nice feature to have, but they can use up a lot of battery power. To conserve battery life, disable vibrations for notifications, calls, and touch feedback. To do this, go to Settings > Sound & vibration > Vibrate on touch. From here, you can choose to turn off vibrations for different features on your phone.

5. Use the "Battery usage" feature

The Redmi Note 8 Pro has a useful battery usage feature that can help you identify which apps are using the most battery power. To access it, go to Settings > Battery & performance > App battery usage. From here, you can see which apps are using the most battery, and you can choose to force stop or disable apps that are using too much battery power.

By implementing these tips, you can significantly improve the battery life of your Redmi Note 8 Pro. Don't let a lack of battery power bring you down - unlock the secret to boosting your phone's battery life today!


The smartphones today come equipped with batteries of high capacity. But people are still complaining about the poor battery life of their smartphone. The battery might be faulty, but that is rarely the case on new smartphones. Most of the time the interface is the culprit. If you have a 4500 mAh (like Redmi Note 8 Pro) or bigger capacity battery in your device and you’re still getting poor battery life, then its time to tweak some things up. Here’s how to improve battery life of Redmi Note 8 Pro.
 
## Improve Battery life of Redmi Note 8 Pro
 
There can be multiple factors that might be affecting the phone’s battery life. In the case of MIUI powered devices, the top culprit is the lack of ROM optimizations. Software updates usually fix the battery drainage so make sure the software is up to date and then try the following troubleshooting steps.
 

 
- When not actively using, turn off Wi-Fi and mobile data. The same goes for other networking tools like GPS. The apps that require GPS might be accessing it from the background. So if you are not actively using the app that requires it, it is wise to disable it. You may not realize but these tools silently drain a lot of battery even when you’re not using it actively.

 
- If you need to go online, use WiFi over mobile data if possible. WiFi uses less battery than mobile data does.
 - Do not use Face Unlock.
 - Disable the apps that you rarely use from starting automatically. To do so, go to Settings > Apps > Manage Apps > select the app that you do not want to auto-start.
 - Disable auto-brightness. Make the habit of manually adjusting the brightness.

 
- Make sure the charger you’re using came out of the box and is not some cheap replica or a 3rd party charger.
 - You can also turn the battery saver on to prolong the battery life. To turn on the battery save in Redmi Note 8 and Note 8 Pro, go to Settings > Battery Options > tap on the toggle next to Battery Saver. You can also configure it to automatically enable when the battery level reaches a certain percentage.

 
- Scan for viruses. If there are malware or viruses on your phone, that could be the reason behind poor battery life. Xiaomi has a security app preinstalled. Find it on the app drawer and use it to look for malware and viruses.
