Google Slides is a powerful tool for creating presentations, and with the addition of transparent images, your presentations are about to get a whole lot better.

Once you have your image in your slide, click on it to open the image options. You'll see a toolbar appear at the top of the screen, with options like Crop, Rotate, and Mask.

Step 3: Adjust the Transparency

Click on the Mask option, and you'll see a dropdown menu with options for a rectangle, circle, and mask. Choose the mask option, and you can adjust the transparency of the image by dragging the slider or typing a percentage into the box.

Step 4: Customize the Mask

If you want to further customize the mask, you can do so by clicking the "Custom shape" option. From there, you can create a custom shape for your mask by dragging the points on the shape, or you can choose from a library of preset shapes.

Step 5: Save Your Transparent Image

Once you're happy with your mask, click "Apply mask" and your image will now be transparent. You can also click "Save as Picture" to save the transparent image as a separate file.

In conclusion, creating transparent images in Google Slides is a simple and effective way to make your presentations more visually appealing and professional.
