IO Interactive will announce a new project tomorrow, November 19th, 2020 at 6 AM PT. Since you should keep an eye on the company’s YouTube channel, at least one first trailer seems to be in the pipeline.
 
There we have it again: the announcement of an announcement of a game. This time it’s a new project from IO Interactive. There is also Hitman 3, which is scheduled to release in January 2021.
 
The announcement of the new game is to be made tomorrow, November 19, 2020, at 6 AM PT, which could take a backseat due to the launch of the PS5. Details were initially not given. It is at least unlikely that this new project will be another “Hitman” title.
 
A new project in collaboration with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment was confirmed last year. At that time it was explicitly stated that we are not dealing with another title of the Hitman series.
 
“We’re very pleased to continue our relationship with the talented team at IO Interactive,” said David Haddad, President of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, in the press release at the time. “IO Interactive has a longstanding legacy of creating iconic games, and we’re looking forward to partnering on this next endeavor to bring a new console and PC gaming experience to players globally.”
 
The secret game will be revealed tomorrow. Since IO Interactive refers to its own YouTube channel in the tweet for the upcoming announcement, at least one trailer seems to be in the pipeline.
