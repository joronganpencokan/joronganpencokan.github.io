Password security is a serious concern for any cautious web user. Although browsers offer ways for us to adjust how they remember passwords, it’s not always an option that’s easily seen, making us forget that it’s there in the first place.
 
Firefox is no exception to this predicament. Its password manager is buried under the Security tab on the Options page, which is something not everyone would know how to find.
 
A great way to keep track of your saved passwords – right where you can see them – is a Firefox add-on called Saved Password Editor. It allows you to save, edit, delete and manage saved passwords in Firefox by simply right-clicking on a web form. A web form, in this case, is any form of login page where a user name and a password is required.
 
The add-on is free and available for download from Firefox’s Add-On website. At the time of writing, it has 167 user reviews with an average rating of 5 stars. Although it’s free to use, the developer welcomes a $5 contribution for his work.
 
The add-on is very simple to use. On a web form, right-click on a field (either the user name or password field) and select one of three options: “Save login info,” “Edit login info,” and “Delete login info.”
 

 
This would, of course, depend on what action you want to take in a specific web form.
 
If this is the first time you are logging in to a page, which means Firefox’s default password manager hasn’t saved the information yet, then you can click on “Save login info.”
 
A new window will appear showing you the details of the web form. No further action is required here, except clicking on “OK.”
 
On the other hand, if you recently changed your user name and password, you can select “Edit login info” and make the changes necessary on the new window that appears. You can click on the “Show” button beside the password field to check if you are changing the correct password. When done, click “OK.”
 
The “Delete login info” will apply when you don’t want the browser to save the password for that specific website and will not delete all other saved logins.
 
Whenever you take an action, whether saving or deleting login information, you will notice a pop-up bar on the bottom right corner of the browser confirming the action.
 
Some minor tweaks can be applied to the way this add-on works. One of them is whether to show or hide passwords in their fields. There are several options and you can select one that you’re most comfortable with.
 
In addition to its ease of use and accessibility, this add-on makes site-specific password management quicker than having to sort it out on Firefox’s default password manager.
 
Because the function lives in the context menu, it creates an awareness for the user to take action on whether to keep the password saved or delete it right then and there. This way, users have more control on their passwords and their security on the web.
