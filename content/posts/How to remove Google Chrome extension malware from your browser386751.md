# WARNING: Is Your Google Chrome Infected? Learn How to Remove the Dangerous Malware in Just 3 Easy Steps!

If you're a Google Chrome user, you may not realize that your browser could be infected with dangerous malware that slows down your computer, displays unwanted ads, and even steals your personal information. Fortunately, there are easy steps that you can take to remove any malware from your Chrome browser and ensure that your computer is safe from harm.

Here are three simple steps that you can take today to remove any malware from your Google Chrome browser:

## Step 1: Scan Your Computer for Malware

The first step in removing malware from your Chrome browser is to scan your computer for viruses and other malicious software. There are several free antivirus programs that can help you with this task, including Avast, AVG, and Malwarebytes.

To get started, visit the website of your preferred antivirus program and download the software. Once the software is installed, run a full scan of your computer to detect any malware that may be lurking on your device.

## Step 2: Remove Any Suspicious Chrome Extensions

The next step in removing malware from your Chrome browser is to remove any suspicious extensions that may be installed on your browser. Malware often disguises itself as legitimate browser extensions, so it's important to review your extensions and remove any that you don't recognize.

To do this, open Chrome and click on the three-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner of your screen. From the drop-down menu, select "More Tools" and then "Extensions". This will bring up a list of all the extensions that are currently installed on your browser.

Review the list and look for any extensions that you don't recognize or that look suspicious. If you find any, click on the "Remove" button next to the extension to remove it from your browser.

## Step 3: Reset Your Chrome Browser Settings

The final step in removing malware from your Chrome browser is to reset your browser settings. This will erase any unwanted settings or preferences that may have been changed by the malware and restore your browser to its default state.

To reset your Chrome browser settings, click on the three-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner of your screen and select "Settings". From the left-hand menu, click on "Advanced" and then "Reset and clean up". Finally, click on "Restore settings to their original defaults" and then click on "Reset Settings" to confirm.

By following these three simple steps, you can remove any malware from your Google Chrome browser and enjoy a safer, more secure browsing experience. Don't wait until it's too late – take action today to protect yourself and your computer from harm!

The best example here would be Google Play, which is notorious for lackluster moderation and sketchy software offerings. Just recently, 116 new malicious apps were found to be hosted on the platform, along with millions of downloads. Tap or click to see how bad the malware was.
But now, a new batch of malware was discovered on Google Chrome’s extension marketplace. More than 500 extensions were found to contain malicious software and users around the world may have already installed several of them. Don’t worry, we’ll show you how you can remove the offending programs.

 
## New malware outbreak at Google: Will it ever end?


Security researchers at Cisco have discovered a new trove of malicious software floating around on a Google marketplace. This time, it’s Chrome extensions that are affected, with more than 500 of them containing malicious codes. 
Speaking to reporters at ZDNet, the researchers concluded the malicious code in these extensions could be used to potentially steal information in phishing attacks. Many of them also randomly inject pop-up ads without users knowing what was responsible.
The researchers at Cisco believe these extensions are part of a much larger malware operation due to coding similarities.
Upon reporting their findings to Google, the search engine giant remotely disabled any affected extensions. This means they’re no longer active and working or available to download; however, users who downloaded them previously will need to manually remove them from their browsers. 

 
## How do I get malicious extensions off my Google Chrome browser?


In one of its most proactive security moves yet, Google automatically disabled malicious extensions across the web. Even if you made the mistake of downloading one of these programs, Google’s actions made sure you wouldn’t be negatively affected. 
Now that the extensions are disabled, this means they can no longer impact your browsing experience unless you turn them back on willingly; however, it’s in your best interest to clean the programs out. Fortunately, every malicious extension will now read Malicious next to their names if flagged by Google.
 To find the extensions installed on your browser, open Chrome on your computer. On the upper right of the browser, click the three-dot hamburger menu and then More Tools, followed by Extensions. Here, you can turn them on/off. If you find one an add-on with the malicious label, delete it.
If you don’t see any with a malicious label, it means you were lucky enough not to download any in the past.
Despite our usual haranguing of Google for its lax moderation, we’ve got to give the company kudos for its quick-thinking move to deactivate all the extensions remotely. Not only does this solve a major compromise problem, it also prevents less tech-savvy people from getting into trouble.
If only we could convince Google to care as much about the Google Play store. Remotely disabling malicious apps would be a lifesaver for unlucky Android users who may have stumbled onto malware without knowing it. Tap or click to see how many Android users may be affected by malware.
