Windows 10 is an operating system that has continued to evolve since its first release in 2015. The latest development build, Windows 10 Build 17704, has brought about some notable changes that have left many users excited. In this video review, we discovered some incredible features that users will love.

Firstly, the new build has a polished visual experience. Windows 10 Build 17704 brings Fluent Design, a design language that Microsoft introduced last year. In this build, Microsoft has expanded the Fluent Design system to make it more consistent throughout the operating system, and it feels very modern and sleek.

The start menu is also more customizable in this build. Users can now group items into folders, and the "All Apps" list now displays even if you don't have any pinned items on your Start menu. This change will be particularly useful for users who want to access all their apps quickly.

Microsoft has taken a completely fresh approach to setting up a PC with Windows 10 Build 17704. When you set up a new PC with this build, you'll be presented with five straightforward questions that you must answer. These questions will help personalize Windows to suit you.

Microsoft also gave attention to notifications. The Action Center now uses the Fluent Design System, which makes it easier to distinguish between the notification types. Additionally, the "Clear all notifications" button now animates with a flourish when you hover your mouse over it.

With this build, the Edge browser has also received some updates. There's a new Web Payment API that makes online transactions much easier. Edge now also comes with InPrivate browsing by default, which ensures that your browsing history is not recorded. Finally, Microsoft added the ability to mute audio and video within Edge. Simply right click on the tab to access this feature.

Conclusion:

Windows 10 Build 17704 is a significant update from Microsoft. It comes with many new features that improve the user experience in Windows 10. We hope our video review has given you a sneak peek of what to expect. The build is expected to roll out to users later in the year, and it's worth keeping an eye out for it.
