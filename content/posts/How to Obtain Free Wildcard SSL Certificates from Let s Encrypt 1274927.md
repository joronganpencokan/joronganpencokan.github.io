Unveiled: The Ultimate Hack to Score Free Wildcard SSL Certificates from Let's Encrypt in Minutes!

The world of the internet is all about security, and SSL certificates play a crucial role in keeping websites secure. Let's Encrypt is an authority in providing free SSL certificates. But, obtaining wildcard certificates from Let's Encrypt can be a bit tricky. However, this article will guide you on how to score free wildcard SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt in just a few minutes.

First off, let's understand what SSL certificates are and why they are important. An SSL certificate is a digital certificate that authenticates the identity of a website and encrypts the communication between the website and the end-user. It ensures that sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card details, and other personal data, transmitted between the website and the user, remains secure from hackers and cybercriminals.

Wildcard SSL certificates, on the other hand, secure multiple subdomains of a domain using a single certificate. For instance, if you have a website with multiple subdomains such as blog.yourdomain.com, shop.yourdomain.com, and so on, then a wildcard SSL certificate will secure all the subdomains with a single certificate.

Now, let's move on to the ultimate hack for obtaining free wildcard SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.

Step 1: Set up an API key with Cloudflare

Cloudflare is a popular Content Delivery Network (CDN) that offers a free plan for websites. It provides HTTPS encryption, DDoS protection, and many other security features. You will need to sign up for a free account with Cloudflare and set up an API key.

Step 2: Install Certbot and Cloudflare plugin

Certbot is a free, open-source software tool that automates the process of obtaining and installing SSL certificates. You can install Certbot on your web server using the command line.

The Cloudflare plugin for Certbot allows you to generate wildcard SSL certificates and verify them automatically with Cloudflare's API. You can install the plugin using the command line.

Step 3: Generate your wildcard SSL certificate

Once you have installed Certbot and the CloudFlare plugin, you can generate your wildcard SSL certificate using the command line. You will need to provide your domain name, email address, and Cloudflare API key to generate the certificate.

Step 4: Verify the certificate with Cloudflare

After generating the certificate, Certbot will automatically verify it with Cloudflare's API. The verification process will take a few minutes. Once the certificate is verified, it will be installed on your web server automatically.

Step 5: Enjoy the benefits of a free wildcard SSL certificate

Congratulations! You have successfully generated and installed a free wildcard SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt using the ultimate hack. Your website is now secure, and all the subdomains are protected by the same certificate.

In conclusion, obtaining free wildcard SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt is a crucial step in securing your website. Using the ultimate hack, you can score free wildcard SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt in just a few minutes. So, go ahead, secure your website, and enjoy the benefits of a secure online presence.

Nowadays, a large portion of Web traffic is encrypted using HTTPS. It is becoming increasingly prevalent, especially since the introduction of Let’s Encrypt, a Certificate Authority (CA) supported by major companies in the industry. Let’s Encrypt provides SSL/TLS certificates completely free of charge with 90-day validity.
 
Generally, certificates are tied to one or more specific domain names, so if you have a certificate for “www.example.com,” you can only use it with this exact domain name. On the other hand, wildcard certificates are issued for a parent domain name and can be used with any subdomain of the parent domain. For instance, a wildcard certificate for *.example.com can be used for “www.example.com,” “account.example.com,” “mail.example.com,” etc. Wildcard certificates, hence, bring the benefit of only having to obtain and renew a single certificate for all your present and future subdomains.
 
Here’s how to obtain a wildcard certificate for a registered domain name from Let’s Encrypt on Ubuntu, Debian and other Debian-based distributions.
 
## 1. Installing acme.sh
 
Let’s Encrypt uses the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol to verify that you own your domain name and to issue/renew certificates. Acme.sh is a popular ACME client implemented in shell script. To install it, you will first need to install git:
 
Download the repository from github:
 
Enter the cloned directory and start the installation script:
 
Reload your shell session to start using acme.sh:
 
## 2. Using acme.sh to issue wildcard certificates.
 
In order for Let’s Encrypt to issue a wildcard certificate, you must solve a DNS-based challenge known as Domain Validation (DV). Acme.sh conveniently integrates with the APIs of many major DNS providers and completely automates this process.
 
### Cloudflare
 
If you are using Cloudflare’s DNS service, log in to your account and copy your global API key. Save it as an environment variable on your system:
 
You can now request a wildcard certificate:
 
### NameCheap
 
If you are using NameCheap nameservers, follow their instructions on enabling API access, then export the required variables:
 
Request a wildcard certificate:
 
### DigitalOcean
 
If your domain uses DigitalOcean’s DNS, follow their instructions on creating a personal access token with read and write permissions. Export your API key/token:
 
### GoDaddy
 
If your domain uses GoDaddy’s DNS, copy your API key and secret. Export them to your environment:
 
### Vultr
 
If you are using Vultr’s DNS, you will need your personal access token or a sub-profile with “Manage DNS” privileges.
 
### RackSpace
 
If you are using RackSpace, you will need your username and API key. Export them as shown below:
 
### Manual Process
 
If you do not want or are unable to use the API provided by your DNS vendor, you can manually create a DNS record to complete the domain validation challenge, though you will also have to repeat this manual process regularly to renew your domain.
 
This command will display a verification token which you will have to add as a DNS TXT record.
 

 
Copy the token and log in  to your DNS control panel. Create a new DNS record of type TXT for the _acme-challenge subdomain and paste the token.
 
Wait a few minutes for the new record to become accessible, then request the certificate:
 
## File Locations
 
You will find your certificate and other relevant files in the “.acme.sh” directory in your home folder.
 
- The certificate itself is saved as “~/.acme.sh/*.example.org/*.example.org.cer.”
 - The certificate key is saved as “~/.acme.sh/*.example.org/*.example.org.key.” This file should be kept private and never shared.
 - The fullchain certificate file, which is what you will most likely use, is saved as “~/.acme.sh/*.example.org/fullchain.cer.” This file combines your certificate with that of the issuing authority (known as the intermediate certificate).

 
Follow the steps above, and you will be able to get a Let’s Encrypt wildcard domain certificate.
