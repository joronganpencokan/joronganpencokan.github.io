# Unlock the Secrets of Minecraft with This Incredible Observer Tutorial!

Are you tired of playing Minecraft the same way over and over again? Do you want to learn how to create complex systems that automate processes? Then you need to learn about the Observer. This incredible Minecraft block is a game-changer, and with this tutorial, you'll unlock its secrets and revolutionize your gameplay.

## What is the Observer?

The Observer is a redstone-powered block that detects changes in the block it faces. When the Observer detects a change, it emits a redstone signal that can be used to activate other redstone components. The Observer is a relatively new addition to Minecraft, first appearing in version 1.11.

## How to Make an Observer

To create an Observer in Minecraft, you'll need six cobblestones and one piece of redstone dust. Arrange the cobblestones around the redstone dust in a "C" shape, with the redstone dust in the middle. This will create an Observer block.

## How to Use the Observer

Now that you have an Observer, it's time to put it to use. The Observer has three sides: an input side, an output side, and a back side. When the block in front of the input side changes, the Observer sends a redstone signal out the output side. The back side is used for powering the Observer with redstone.

One of the most useful things you can do with the Observer is create automatic farms. For example, you can create a wheat farm that automatically harvests and replants the wheat. Simply place an Observer facing down toward the wheat, with a piston and a block above the wheat. When the wheat grows, it will push the block up, triggering the Observer and activating the piston to harvest the wheat. The piston will then replace the harvested wheat and reset the system.

Another use for the Observer is creating automatic doors. Simply place an Observer facing the door, and an output wire leading to a piston. When someone walks up to the door, the Observer will detect the player and activate the piston, opening the door.

## Conclusion

The Observer is an incredibly powerful tool in Minecraft that can be used to automate all sorts of processes. With just a little bit of redstone knowledge and creativity, you can create complex systems that revolutionize your gameplay. So try out the Observer today and unlock the secrets of Minecraft!

An Observer is a Block Update detection Block in Minecraft. If there is a Block Update in front of the Observer then it will give a Redstone Pulse. A Block Update is described as a change in Block or Fluid State. Some examples of these can be Plants Growing, Rusting of Copper, Placing or Removing a Block, the flow of Water or Lava, etc. This block helped the Minecraft Redstone Community a lot by reducing their builds to a fraction of the size.
