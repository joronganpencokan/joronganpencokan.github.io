This article explains how to modify text size in Internet Explorer 11.0.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Easiest method: In the command toolbar, select Page > Text Size > select text size.Or go to Settings > Internet Options > Accessibility > Ignore font sizes specified on web pages.Shortcut to increase text: Ctrl+ on Windows, or Cmd+ on Mac. Decrease: Ctrl- on Windows, or Cmd- on Mac.

 
##   Changing the Default Text Size  
 

Use the menus to change the default size so that every browser session reflects the new size. Two toolbars provide text size settings: the command bar and the menu bar. The command bar is visible by default, while the menu bar is hidden by default.

 
Microsoft no longer supports Internet Explorer and recommends that you update to the newer Edge browser. Head to their site to download the newest version.
 
###   Using the Command Toolbar  
 

The easiest way to change text size is using the Internet Explorer command toolbar:

 
- Select the Page drop-down menu on the command toolbar.
 - Then select the Text Size option.
 - Choose from Largest, Larger, Medium (default), Smaller, or Smallest. The current selection displays a black dot.

 
###   Using the Menu Toolbar  
 

Alternatively, use the Internet Explorer menu toolbar:

 

Select the Page drop-down menu on the command toolbar.

 

Then select the Text Size option.

 

Choose from Largest, Larger, Medium (default), Smaller, or Smallest. The current selection displays a black dot.

 
- Open Internet Explorer and press Alt to display the menu toolbar.
 - Select View from the menu toolbar.
 - Choose Text Size.
 - The same options appear here as on the Page menu.

 
##   Using Accessibility Options to Control Text Size  
 

Some web pages have explicitly fixed the size of text, so the methods above don't work to change it. Internet Explorer provides a range of accessibility options that can override a web page's settings. If you try the methods here and your text is unchanged, use Internet Explorer's accessibility options.

 

Open Internet Explorer and press Alt to display the menu toolbar.

 

Select View from the menu toolbar.

 

Choose Text Size.

 

The same options appear here as on the Page menu.

 
- Open Settings by selecting the gear icon to the right of the browser.
 - Choose Internet Options to open an options dialog.
 - Select Accessibility near the bottom of the window to open an Accessibility dialog.
 - Tick the checkbox Ignore font sizes specified on web pages, then press OK.
 - Exit the options menu and return to your browser.

 
##   Temporarily Change Text Size Using Keyboard Shortcuts  
 

Most browsers, including Internet Explorer, support common keyboard shortcuts to increase or decrease the size of the text. These affect the current browser session only, in fact, if you open another tab in the browser, the text in that tab reverts to the default size.

 

Open Settings by selecting the gear icon to the right of the browser.

 

Choose Internet Options to open an options dialog.

 

Select Accessibility near the bottom of the window to open an Accessibility dialog.

 

Tick the checkbox Ignore font sizes specified on web pages, then press OK.

 

Exit the options menu and return to your browser.

 
- To increase text size: Press Ctrl + (the plus sign) on Windows, or Cmd + on a Mac.To decrease text size: Press Ctrl - (the minus sign) on Windows, or Cmd - on a Mac.

 

Note that these keyboard shortcuts actually zoom in or out, rather than increasing only the text size. This means that they increase the size not only of text but also images and other page elements.

 
##   Zoom In or Out   
 

A zoom option is available in the same menus that have a text size option, i.e. the Page menu on the command toolbar and the View menu on the menu toolbar. This option is the same as using the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl + and Ctrl - (or Cmd + and Cmd - on a Mac).
