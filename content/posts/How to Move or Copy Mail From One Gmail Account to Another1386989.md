# Unlock The Ultimate Gmail Hack: Learn How To Instantly Move or Copy Your Mail to a New Account!

Are you tired of juggling multiple email accounts? Do you wish there was an easy way to transfer all your important messages to a new Gmail account? Look no further than this simple Gmail hack that will save you time and hassle.

With just a few clicks, you can instantly move or copy your entire mailbox from one Gmail account to another. This is particularly useful when you're switching to a new email address or consolidating multiple accounts into one.

So, how do you do it? Follow these simple steps:

Step 1: Create a new Gmail account

The first step is to create a new Gmail account to transfer your messages to. If you're already setting up a new account, great, you can skip this step.

Step 2: Enable IMAP in both accounts

In order to transfer your messages between Gmail accounts, you'll need to enable IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) in both accounts. This can be done by navigating to the "Settings" menu in your Gmail account, selecting "Forwarding and POP/IMAP", and then enabling IMAP.

Step 3: Add your old Gmail account to the new one

Next, you'll need to add your old Gmail account to the new one. To do this, go to the "Settings" menu in your new Gmail account, select "Accounts and Import", and then click on "Import mail and contacts".

From there, enter the email address of your old Gmail account and follow the prompts to allow access. This will automatically begin the process of transferring your messages to your new account.

Step 4: Choose your transfer options

You can choose to move or copy your messages to your new account. Moving your messages will remove them from your old account and place them in your new one, whereas copying your messages will create duplicates in your new account without deleting the originals in your old one.

Step 5: Sit back and relax

Once you've chosen your transfer options, sit back and let Gmail do the work! Depending on the number of messages you're transferring, this process may take some time. However, you can close your browser window and allow the transfer to continue in the background.

Congratulations! You've learned how to easily transfer your Gmail messages to a new account. This hack can save you time and hassle, particularly if you're managing multiple email addresses or need to consolidate your messages into one account.

Remember, you can always repeat this process in reverse if you ever need to transfer your messages back to your original account. Give it a try and enjoy the freedom and convenience of a freshly consolidated inbox.

This article explains how to configure POP access and then use one of two methods to migrate messages between Gmail accounts: fetch emails using Gmail, or manually transfer emails with an email program like Outlook. Also included are instructions to stop importing mail.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- In Gmail, go to Settings > See All Settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP. In POP Download, select Enable POP for all mail.See All Settings > Accounts and Import > Add email account > email address > Import emails from my other account (POP3).POP Server = pop.gmail.com and Port = 995. Select Yes, I want to be able to send mail. Select Treat as an alias. Verify account.

 
##   Configure POP Access for Your Old Account  
 

You must have your old account configured to allow access using Post Office Protocol. If you already set it up, make sure all email programs or services you have configured to download mail from your old Gmail account using POP are closed or set not to check mail automatically. Then skip to the next section.

 

If you haven't yet activated POP:

 
- From your Gmail account, select the Settings gear icon in the accounts toolbar.
 - Select See All Settings.
 - Choose Forwarding and POP/IMAP.
 - In the POP Download section, select Enable POP for all mail as the status.
 - You do not have to move messages to the old account's inbox for the new account to pick them up. Archived mail will be fetched and copied to the new account automatically.
 - From the When messages are accessed with POP menu, you have several options:
 - Select archive Gmail's copy to clear your old account's inbox while keeping them in the Archive folder in case you want to access them later.
 - Select delete Gmail's copy to move mail instead of copying it. This option moves old messages to the trash, so you won't be able to get them later.
 - Select keep Gmail's copy in the Inbox to leave the original message untouched.
 - Choose mark Gmail's copy as read to leave the original email in the Inbox and mark it as read. This shows you what Gmail has forwarded and what it hasn't.
 - If you do want to retain some messages at the old account, they will be available in the Trash label for 30 days.
 - Select Save Changes.

You can always add your old address as a sending address later. If you do select No, click Finish right away and skip the following steps that add the old address to the new account.

 
##   Make Your Gmail Accounts Recognize Each Other  
 

To make sure your old Gmail address is recognized by the new Gmail account as one of yours — and available for sending:

 

After you've logged into the account, select the Settings gear icon.

 

Select See All Settings from the menu.

 

Go to the Accounts and Import tab.

 

Select Add a mail account under Check mail from other accounts.

 

Enter the email address of the Gmail account from which you want to import under Email address.

 

Select Next.

 

On the next screen, select the Import emails from my other account (POP3) option.

 

Type the password for the Gmail account from which you import under Password.

 
If you have enabled two-factor authentication for the old Gmail account, create and use a Gmail application password instead.
 

Select pop.gmail.com under POP Server.

 

Select 995 under Port.

 

Verify Leave a copy of retrieved messages on the server is not checked.

 

Verify Always use a secure connection (SSL) when retrieving mail is checked. Select Label incoming messages and pick the label corresponding to the old Gmail account's email address, an existing label, or a new label. Select Archive incoming messages (Skip the Inbox), so imported emails do not show up your new Gmail account's inbox.

 

Select Add Account.

 
If you see an access error, you have two options: With 2-step authentication enabled especially, you may have to authorize Gmail to access itself. If you do not have 2-step authentication turned on, make sure "less secure" applications are allowed to access Gmail.
 

Select Yes, I want to be able to send mail as username@gmail.com under Would you also like to be able to send mail as username@gmail.com?

 
Having your old address set up as a sending address in the new account lets Gmail recognize your old sent messages and place them in the Sent Mail label. You can always add your old address as a sending address later. If you do select No, click Finish right away and skip the following steps that add the old address to the new account.
 
- Continuing from Yes, I want to be able to send mail as username@gmail.com, select Next.
 - Enter your name under Name.
 - Leave Treat as an alias checked.
 - Select Next Step twice.
 - Select Send Verification.
 - Click Close window.
 - Select the account icon in the top right corner of Gmail.
 - Select Sign out from the sheet that comes up.
 - Log in to Gmail using the address from which you import.
 - Open the message from Gmail Team with the subject Gmail Confirmation - Send Mail as username@gmail.com.
 - Highlight and copy the numeral confirmation code under Confirmation code. It is better not to follow the verification link and instead login with the correct account in your browser first, then use the code there.
 - As an alternative to the somewhat convoluted process that follows, you can wait for your new Gmail account to import the verification message and follow the confirmation link from there.
 - Select your account's icon in the top right corner.
 - Select Sign out.
 - Log in to Gmail again, this time with the account to which you're importing.
 - Select the Settings gear icon.
 - Click See All Settings.
 - Open the Accounts and Import tab.
 - Select Verify for the old Gmail account's address under Send mail as.
 - Paste the verification code under Enter and verify the confirmation code.
 - Select Verify to finish connecting the accounts.

 

Gmail will not fetch all messages in one go. It will download mail from the old account in batches of approximately 100 to 200 emails at a time instead. Typically, importing will start with the oldest messages.

 

Continuing from Yes, I want to be able to send mail as username@gmail.com, select Next.

 

Enter your name under Name.

 

Leave Treat as an alias checked.

 

Select Next Step twice.

 

Select Send Verification.

 

Click Close window.

 

Select the account icon in the top right corner of Gmail.

 

Select Sign out from the sheet that comes up.

Open the message from Gmail Team with the subject Gmail Confirmation - Send Mail as username@gmail.com.

 

Highlight and copy the numeral confirmation code under Confirmation code. It is better not to follow the verification link and instead login with the correct account in your browser first, then use the code there.

Select your account's icon in the top right corner.

 

Select Sign out.

 

Log in to Gmail again, this time with the account to which you're importing.

 

Select the Settings gear icon.

 

Click See All Settings.

 

Open the Accounts and Import tab.

 

Select Verify for the old Gmail account's address under Send mail as.

 

Paste the verification code under Enter and verify the confirmation code.

 

Select Verify to finish connecting the accounts.

 

Gmail will download messages in your old Gmail account's Sent Mail label along with messages you've received. Sent mail will appear under the new account's Sent Mail label, too.

 

After importing, you can use the old address with your new Gmail account, effectively combining the two accounts.
