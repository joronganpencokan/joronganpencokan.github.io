Discover the Ultimate Amazon Shopping Hack to Keep Your Gifts a Secret - Your Loved Ones Will Be Shocked!

The anticipation of receiving a gift is always exciting, but the excitement fades if you know what you'll be receiving. Often, finding the perfect gift can be tricky, but once you find it, keeping it a secret is an essential part of making it special. With the internet making shopping more accessible, it can be challenging to keep a surprise from nosy loved ones. Fortunately, there are ways to shop for gifts online that will help to keep them a surprise.

Amazon is the largest ecommerce platform, with countless products and gifting options. Shopping on Amazon can be a hassle-free experience, but it also comes with a downside: your loved ones may find out what you have bought for them. Fortunately, there is an Amazon shopping hack that can keep your gifts a secret until it's time to unwrap them.

The hack is to create a private wishlist for your loved ones. This mode allows you to keep all your purchases a secret. It’s the perfect solution to ensure that nobody sees what you're buying. You can sort products by preference, prioritize them, and add multiple items to the wishlist. No one else will be able to see it, not even the recipient. However, if you want to share your list with someone, such as your partner or your mother, you can invite them to view it through a private link.

Here's how to create a private wishlist on Amazon:

1. Log into your Amazon account.
2. Browse and select the items you want to purchase for your loved one.
3. Click the "Add to List" button next to each item.
4. Select "Create a list" and choose "Wishlist."
5. Set the privacy level to "Only Me" using the drop-down menu under "Privacy" on the left-hand side.
6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 until you've added all your desired items to your private wishlist.

That's it! You’ve now created a secret list of items you want to buy for your loved ones. This method ensures that the surprise isn’t ruined before you get to give the gift to them. Plus, if you ever want to add or delete items from the list, you have complete control. 

In conclusion, Amazon shopping can be fun and stress-free, but it’s only enjoyable if you can maintain the surprise of your gifts. Creating a private wishlist is an excellent hack for online shoppers who want to keep their purchases a secret. It's easy to use, and it’s a fool-proof solution to keep your loved ones guessing until the big reveal. So, let this ultimate Amazon shopping hack be your guide, and enjoy the satisfaction of keeping the surprise element alive in your gifting game.

But early gift shopping poses a common problem – how do you NOT ruin that holiday surprise?
Most of the time, you just don’t want to reveal spoilers for gifts you’ve bought for your loved ones.
The two adult accounts can also manage the household’s child profiles.

 
### Archive an order


One is archiving an order. Not only will this action hide gift purchases from your order history, it can also hide items that you no longer want to reference or simply embarrassed to reveal.
This will remove the item from immediate viewing within your order history. Note: Archived orders can still be viewed by going to “Your Account” page and selecting “View Archived Orders.” These items can also be restored by selecting “Unarchive Order.”

 
### Remove items from browsing history


To avoid revealing your potential gift ideas to your household, you can remove an item from your browsing history or even clear it out entirely.
Note: You can also turn off your account’s Browsing History entirely by selecting “Turn off browsing history.”

 
### Remove items from your Recommendations




 
### Ship to a different address


You can also ship to a different address by visiting the “Manage Addresses and 1-Click Settings” in Your Account.
Just click “Enter a new address” and put in the details. For security reasons, you will be asked to confirm your credit card each time you place an order using a new or edited address.
Note: You can also delete or edit any saved address you have in this section.

 
### Bonus tip: Make a list and check it twice


Anyone can benefit from a little organization when it comes to shopping online, especially when you’re trying to be spoiler-free.
So, start with a list to track all your gifts. A spreadsheet like Excel will work well.
List everyone who will be getting a present. Then, list the item you intend to purchase. Make columns for the online store, the date ordered, and the expected arrival date. Add a column to check off arrivals. For good measure, include a column for tracking numbers.
This list will help you track your purchases, hidden or otherwise. If something doesn’t arrive on time, you can investigate.
