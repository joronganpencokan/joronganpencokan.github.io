Introduction

Windows 8 is a great operating system but one of its downsides is its limited storage space. For many users, this can be frustrating as files and programs accumulate over time. However, there are ways to maximize your storage space without having to purchase an external hard drive. In this article, we will explore the secret to maximizing your Windows 8 storage space and how you can become a pro in just a few clicks.

Step 1: Uninstall Unused Programs

The first step towards maximizing your storage space is to uninstall any unused programs. Every program installed takes up space on your hard drive, and it is good practice to regularly remove programs you no longer use. To do this:

1. Click the Start button and select Control Panel.

2. In the Control Panel, click on Programs and Features

3. Select the program you want to remove and click on Uninstall.

Step 2: Delete Temporary Files

Temporary files can quickly accumulate and take up valuable storage space on your computer. Deleting these files is a simple process and can be done in just a few clicks.

1. Click the Start button and type "Disk Cleanup" in the search bar.

2. Select the drive you want to clean up and click the "OK" button.

3. Select the files you want to delete and click "OK."

Step 3: Use Windows Built-in Storage Spaces

Another way to maximize your storage space in Windows 8 is to use the built-in storage spaces feature. This allows you to pool multiple hard drives together to create one larger virtual drive. To use this feature:

1. Click the Start button and type "Storage Spaces" in the search bar.

2. Click on the Storage Spaces option in the search results.

3. Click on the "Create a new pool and storage space" option and follow the prompts.

Step 4: Move Files to External Storage

If you have files that you don't need to access regularly, consider moving them to an external storage device such as a USB drive or external hard drive. This will free up space on your computer's hard drive and ensure that your important files are safe.

Conclusion

By following these simple steps, you can maximize your Windows 8 storage space and become a pro in just a few clicks. Uninstalling unused programs, deleting temporary files, using Windows built-in storage spaces, and moving files to external storage are all effective ways to free up valuable space on your hard drive. By maintaining a clean and organized computer, you can ensure that your computer runs smoothly and efficiently.

Once you’ve created a storage space, your media library: music, movies, photos, and files, will continue to expand, and although virtualizing the ever-growing collection of USB drives will help you, not only to prevision available capacity and to keep files organized, but also to keep your precious memories protected from hardware failure. And for all this to work, you still need to know the basics on how to manage Storage Spaces and pools.
 
If you need more information on this new disk pooling feature in Windows 8 visit this previous article.
 
Now, you already connected one or more drives to your PC and created a pool with one or more spaces, next is to learn how mange the new feature, and there are various aspects that you can control with Storage Spaces. We are going to start with “Storage Pool” and its options:
 
## Managing Storage Pool
 
The new storage virtualization technology in Windows 8 allows you to create one or many Storage Pool (This is the way in which we group different physical drives together, but they are not yet usable by the operating system), and then inside you can create as many Storage Spaces as you need (virtual disks that behave just like physical disks) — to create a new storage pool and space, check our previous article.
 
The first thing you’ll notice in the Manage Storage Spaces page is that all the options are grayed-out or unavailable, to make the options available again you need to click the Change settings button in the top-right corner.
 

 
From the Storage pool, you also have the option to add more capacity when needed with the Add drives link. Additionally at anytime you can change the name of the each pool by clicking Rename Pool.
 
Finally you’ll see the green status bar displaying free space available. Here don’t get confused, the status is only for the total capacity on the physical drives, not for the total capacity of all or each individual spaces (virtual disks). If you want to know how much free space there is in each space, you can do that like you would with any media, through the Windows Explorer.
 
## Managing Storage Spaces
 
The options to manage spaces are limited, but they are enough to what you need to do. You can View files, which essentially is the same as accessing a drive via Windows Explorer. With the Change option, you can change the name, drive letter and the maximum size of the storage space. Here you can also expand the maximum capacity, but remember that you cannot reduce the size of it — When you are done making all the changes, simply click the Change storage space button.
 
If you need to change the size of a space to a lower capacity, one way to do this would be deleting and recreating the space, for this or just to get rid of it, you have the option Delete, which is the third option in each virtual disk.
 
In the event you start running out of capacity or a physical disk fails, a notification like the image below will appear.
 
 Just click on the notification to see information about the problem and how to fix it.
 
Or you can check for problems in the Windows Action Center under Maintenance section.
 
That is all there is to it. 
 
## Things you need to know
 
- Storage Spaces doesn’t use defrag or CHKDSK tools. If a physical disk becomes corrupt, you’ll need to  treat like a failed disk — remove from the pool, try to repair it and if the disk is OK, you can re-add it to the pool.
 - If you have configured two-way mirrored space, you have two copies of all files. If you configured three-way mirrored space, you have three copies of all files.
 - Decreasing the logical size of a space is not supported. But you can increase at anytime.
 - Yes, you can move a storage pool from one PC to another — simply connect the physical disks that are part of the group in the new Windows 8 PC but not in a Windows 7 PC, and you can plug them in any order.

 
## Last note
 
As you can see from the image below, the new virtual drives behave as if they were normal drives, you can take them offline, format, partition, shrink or delete volumes, just like you would expect from any storage media. The exception is that you cannot boot from a space. And you can even encrypt a storage space by using BitLocker.
