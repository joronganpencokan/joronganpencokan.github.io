Are you struggling to create professional and effective flowcharts for your office tasks? Look no further than Google Docs! With its easy-to-use interface and powerful range of features, Google Docs is the perfect tool for creating high-quality flowcharts that will help you stay organized, focused, and productive while working on important projects.

In this article, we'll take a look at some of the key features of Google Docs that make it the ideal choice for creating flowcharts or diagrams quickly and easily, and we'll explore some essential tips to ensure that your flowcharts are professional and easy to understand.

## Why Use Google Docs for Flowchart Creation?

There are several reasons why Google Docs is the ultimate tool for creating flowcharts or diagrams. Here are just a few of the standout benefits:

- **Collaborative Editing:** Google Docs is a collaborative editing platform, which makes it ideal for creating flowcharts in a team setting. You can invite other team members to edit the document in real-time, making it incredibly easy to work together and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

- **Ease of Use:** Google Docs is incredibly user-friendly, even for those who have little experience with flowchart creation. The intuitive interface makes it easy to add shapes, text, and other elements to your flowchart, without any confusing menus or complicated settings.

- **Range of Features:** Google Docs comes equipped with a range of useful features that can be applied to flowchart creation, including custom shapes, templates, and the ability to easily move and resize all elements. And, because Google Docs is a cloud-based platform, your team can access your flowcharts from anywhere, at any time.

## How to Create a Professional Flowchart in Google Docs

So, how do you create a professional flowchart in Google Docs? Here are some essential tips to keep in mind:

**1. Determine the Purpose of Your Flowchart**

Before you begin creating your flowchart, it's important to have a clear understanding of its purpose. Are you using it to illustrate a business process? To document a workflow? Make sure you have a clear understanding of what you hope to achieve with the flowchart before you begin.

**2. Choose the Right Shape for Each Element**

When it comes to creating a flowchart, choosing the right shape for each element is crucial. There are several different shapes to choose from in Google Docs, each of which has its own specific purpose. For example, you might use a rectangle to represent a process, a diamond to represent a decision point, or a circle to represent a start or end point.

**3. Use Lines to Connect Your Shapes**

One of the key features of any flowchart is the lines that connect the various shapes. Make sure to use appropriate line styles to make it clear which shapes are connected and what the relationship between them is.

**4. Keep It Simple and Organized**

When it comes to creating a professional flowchart, it's important to keep things simple and organized. Avoid cluttering the chart with unnecessary elements or over-complicating the design. Instead, focus on making it easy to follow and understand with clean lines, sharp colors, and clear labels.

## Conclusion

Creating a professional flowchart in Google Docs is simpler than you might think. With the right tools and knowledge, you can easily create a flowchart that will help you stay organized, focused, and productive while working on important projects. So why wait? Try your hand at creating a flowchart in Google Docs today, and take your office productivity to the next level!

This article explains how to create flowcharts in Google Docs and Google Drawings from scratch and using an add-on. You can only make flowcharts on the desktop version of Google Docs.

 
### 
What To Know
 
- Go to Insert > Drawing > New > choose options > Save and Close.
 - Another way is through Google Drawings. When finished, go to Insert > Drawing > From Drive in Docs.

 
##   Create a Flowchart Manually  
 

Google Docs provides direct access to Google Drawings, which is where we'll be making the flowchart. The options are basic but should be fine for most people.

 
- Select where in the document you want the flowchart to go. You can always change this later.
 - Go to Insert > Drawing > New.
 - You might notice the Chart menu option here. As much sense as it'd make to go there to create a flowchart, the Chart menu is for making other charts like pie charts and bar graphs.
 - Use the menu to add lines, shapes, text, etc. to create the flowchart.
 - What you're doing here is accessing Google Drawings. If you'd rather work there instead (there are more tools, including flowchart templates), go to the Google Drawings page.
 - Select Save and Close to import it into your document. If you worked on the flowchart from Drawings, find it in the Insert > Drawing > From Drive menu.

 

With the flowchart now in the document, you can move the flowchart around the page like you would an image and adjust the text wrap options depending on how you want it to sit with the page’s text.

Select Save and Close to import it into your document. If you worked on the flowchart from Drawings, find it in the Insert > Drawing > From Drive menu.

 

To edit the flowchart, either double-click it or select it once to find the Edit button.

 
##   Use a Flowchart Template  
 

Google's flowchart tools are fine, but if you want a method that provides more options or a template to start off with, use an add-on.

 
- Go to Extensions > Add-ons > Get add-ons.
 - Use the search bar to find and install a flowchart maker. We used Lucidchart Diagrams for the rest of these steps.
 - Return to the Add-ons menu and choose Lucidchart Diagrams > Insert Diagram.
 - Select Sign in with Google and follow the prompts.
 - Choose the plus sign at the bottom of the Lucidcharts side window, and then select Flowchart. You'll immediately be redirected to the Lucid.app website to build the flowchart.
 - Edit the diagram using the tools from the menu on the left. This flowchart designer supports drag-and-drop, so you can easily insert squares and other shapes, lines, and text boxes.
 - To use a template instead, open Lucidchart's File > New > From Template menu. The first few are free.
 - When you're finished, name it something unique by editing the title, and then select Back to Docs at the top left.
 - Select the flowchart from the side panel (you probably have to choose My Diagrams first).
 - Use the INSERT button to add it to Google Docs.

 

Any edits we'd want to make to this flowchart would be done through Lucid.app. To have them reflected in the document, go to Extensions > Add-ons > Lucidchart Diagrams > Update Inserted Diagrams in Google Docs.
