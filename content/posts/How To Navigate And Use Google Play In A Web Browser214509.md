# Unlock The Secret To Mastering Google Play on Your Web Browser - The Ultimate Guide!

If you're an Android user, you're probably well aware of Google Play, your go-to destination for downloading apps, games, music, movies, TV shows and more. Whether you're navigating through the web or the app, Google Play has become an essential part of the Android experience. However, there's still a whole world of features and possibilities that many users may be missing out on. In this article, we'll reveal some of the best tips and tricks to help you master Google Play on your web browser.

### 1. Access Google Play from any web browser

Did you know that you can access Google Play from any web browser? By visiting the website play.google.com, you can browse, download and install Android apps and games directly from your computer. This feature comes in handy when you want to install an app on your phone, but it's out of reach or not in front of you. Simply log into your Google account and start browsing!

### 2. Filter and sort search results

Google Play has millions of apps and games to choose from, making searching and discovering new apps a challenge. Fortunately, you can filter and sort search results to find exactly what you're looking for. On the left-hand side of the page, you'll find a filter panel where you can select app type, rating, price, and more. You can also sort the results by relevance, ratings, alphabetically, or by the latest updates.

### 3. Manage your devices

Do you have multiple Android devices linked to your Google account? You can manage and keep track of all your devices on Google Play. From your web browser, navigate to your account settings, and scroll down to the "Your Devices" section. You can see all your connected devices and manage their settings, including disabling unwanted apps or remotely installing apps.

### 4. Share app links

If you've found an app that you want to share with your friends or family, you can easily share the app link from Google Play. Click on the app you want to share, and look for the "Share" button located at the top of the page. You can share the link via Facebook, email, or other messaging apps. Sharing links is also an excellent way to recommend apps to others.

### 5. Check updates for your apps

Keeping apps updated is important, but it's effortless to forget to check for updates manually. Fortunately, Google Play automatically checks and notifies you when new updates are available for apps you've installed. However, you can also review updates manually from the web browser. Click on "My apps & games" located in the left-hand menu, and you'll find any available updates.

### 6. Add reviews and ratings

If you've used an app or game, leaving a review and rating is helpful for both the developer and other users. From the app's page, scroll down until you see the "Ratings & Reviews" section. Click on "Write a review" to add your thoughts and rating about the app. This small gesture helps developers create better apps and introduces potential new users to the app.

### 7. Control your subscriptions

If you've subscribed to apps or services through Google Play, you can manage your subscriptions from your web browser. Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select "Payments & subscriptions." From there, you can review all subscriptions, cancel, or renew them.

Google Play is a vast platform with endless possibilities, and mastering it requires effort, time, and experience. However, with the help of these tips and tricks, you can make the most of your Google Play experience from your web browser. Enjoy exploring the vast collection of apps, games, music, movies, and TV shows that Google Play has to offer!

Google Play is the most comprehensive app store available for Android, filled with apps and other forms of content for you to consume on your mobile device. But how do you find that content? Here’s what you need to know.
 
## Introduction
 
Google Play is Google’s one-stop shop for content to enjoy on your Android device. The store typically comes pre-installed on Android products, but it’s also accessible via a web browser. The shop’s primary departments are all listed on the left-hand side: Store, Apps, Movies & TV, Music, Books, Newsstand, and Devices. “Store” covers everything, and it’s the default page when you visit the site. The others are self-explanatory.
 

 
## Finding Apps & Content
 
Inside each of these top level departments, you have the option to filter through content by category. Though the categories change depending on whether you’re looking at apps, books, music, etc., the option to filter is located in the same spot for each. Here we see the list of categories available for Android apps and games.
 
Some categories make this list twice. Widgets, for example, is listed both under apps (on the left) and games (on the right). Clicking on either will show the appropriate apps, but there will be nothing on the page to signify this. Take a look at the screenshot below. You can tell these are game widgets, as opposed to app widgets, purely by recognizing that the results are related to games.
 
Here is the full list of app and game categories available:
 
Apps
 
- Books & Reference
 - Business
 - Comics
 - Communication
 - Education
 - Entertainment
 - Finance
 - Health & Fitness
 - Libraries & Demo
 - Lifestyle
 - Live Wallpaper
 - Media & Video
 - Medical
 - Music & Audio
 - News & Magazines
 - Personalization
 - Photography
 - Productivity
 - Shopping
 - Social
 - Sports
 - Tools
 - Transportation
 - Travel & Local
 - Weather
 - Widgets

 
Games
 
- Action
 - Adventure
 - Arcade
 - Board
 - Card
 - Casino
 - Casual
 - Educational
 - Family
 - Live Wallpaper
 - Music
 - Puzzle
 - Racing
 - Role Playing
 - Simulation
 - Sports
 - Strategy
 - Trivia
 - Widgets
 - Word

 
Some of these categories are fairly ambiguous. “Libraries & Demos,” for example, refers to supplementary software, such as additional filters and effects for a camera app, extra languages for a dictionary, or plugins for a home screen launcher. “Live Wallpaper” may make sense under apps, but what about games? As it turns out, some games come with live wallpapers, and this category highlights those that do.
 
## Installing Apps
 
Getting apps onto your device is fairly straightforward. Just click on any app that interests you, and on the next page, you will see a big green “install” button at the top (if the app isn’t free, you will see the price along with the word “buy” instead).
 
Below it you see a notice of whether the app is compatible with any or all of your devices. Clicking on this sentence will bring up a list of which of your devices are supported.
 
When you click on the install/buy button, it will then prompt you for payment (if necessary) and ask which device you want to install the software on. It will then appear on your device automatically.
 
## Rating & Reviews
 
The most popular and well-received apps make their way to the top of the page. This is convenient, but it also depends on user feedback in order to be useful. You can take part in this yourself by going to an app’s page and scrolling down to view its rating along with a number of comments.
 
At the top right-hand side of this area, there is the option to “write a review.” Here you can give an app or item a 1 through 5 rating and leave a short blurb summarizing your impressions. To the right of that option is a right-facing area that will let you view more reviews that others have left. You have the option to filter these reviews by newness, rating, helpfulness, device, or version.
 
## Settings & Finances
 
Back on the home “Store” page, there are five additional options for managing your account.
 
The first, “My Play activity,” shows your most recent app ratings and reviews. “My wishlist” shows a list of the apps, books, albums, and other content you want to purchase in the future. “Redeem” is where you go when someone’s given you a Google Play gift card. “Buy gift card” is where you go to buy a gift card yourself, whereas “Buy Google Play credit” is what you hit up to add credit directly to your account. In the US, options range from $5 to $50.
 
In the top right corner, there’s a settings cog where you can view your orders, determine which devices have access to the Play Store under your account, and use the Android Device Manager.
 
## Conclusion
 
That’s the gist of how Google Play’s web interface works. Sometimes having a full browser to work with can make discovering software an easier task than dealing with a small touchscreen.
