Title: You Won’t Believe How Tall Kratos, Tyr, Thor, and Odin Will Be in God of War Ragnarok - Mind-Blowing Heights Revealed!

The gaming world has been eagerly waiting for God of War Ragnarok, the upcoming action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio. The game is the sequel to God of War (2018), which was a massive hit among gamers worldwide. As the release date of God of War Ragnarok draws closer, fans are getting more excited and curious about what to expect from the game.

One of the most talked-about aspects of the game is the height of the characters. In the previous game, we saw Kratos, the protagonist, and his son Atreus interact with Norse gods like Baldur and Freya, who were of considerable height. However, in the upcoming game, we will see even more towering figures. The latest reports suggest that Kratos, Tyr, Thor, and Odin will be mind-blowingly tall in God of War Ragnarok.

Kratos, the god of War, not only has incredible strength but also an impressive height of 6’6” (198cm). However, he will be dwarfed by other gods who will appear in the next game. Tyr, the Norse god of war, who was mentioned but never seen in the last game, will make his debut in God of War Ragnarok. According to reports, Tyr will be taller than Kratos, standing at 7’2” (218cm). His height will make him one of the most impressive characters in the game.

But the tallest god in God of War Ragnarok will be none other than Thor, the god of Thunder. Thor is known for his immense size in mythology, and it seems Santa Monica Studio has taken inspiration from those myths. According to leaks, Thor will have a height of a staggering 8’3” (251cm), making him almost twice as tall as Kratos. Thor's design in the game has also been inspired by WWE wrestler, Braun Strowman, who stands at 6’8”.

However, even Thor's height will be overshadowed by Odin, the Allfather, and the most powerful Norse god in the game. Odin's design has been kept under wraps, but reports suggest that he will be the tallest character in God of War Ragnarok, towering over all the other gods, including Thor. According to leaks, Odin will have a height of 12’5” (381cm), making him one of the tallest video game characters ever designed.

In conclusion, God of War Ragnarok promises to be an epic game for many reasons, and the towering heights of the Norse gods is just one of them. Fans can expect to see impressive character designs that will leave them in awe. Kratos, Tyr, Thor, and Odin will be larger than life, and facing them in the game will make for an unforgettable experience. Gamers will have to wait until the game's release to truly appreciate the mind-blowing heights of these gods.
