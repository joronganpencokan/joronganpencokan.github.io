Prepare to Steal the Crown Jewels with Hood Outlaws And Legends – The Ultimate Multiplayer Heist Game Coming to Xbox Series X, PS5, PC, Xbox One, and PS4!

Are you ready to take on the ultimate heist? Do you have what it takes to assemble a team of outlaws and thieves, plan and execute the perfect robbery, and get away with the greatest treasure in all of England? If so, then you're going to love Hood Outlaws And Legends, the upcoming multiplayer game that puts you in the shoes of a master thief.

Set in a dark and dangerous medieval world, Hood Outlaws And Legends is a game that tasks you with stealing the Crown Jewels of England. But you can't do it alone. You'll need to assemble a team of skilled and cunning thieves, each with their own unique abilities, to help you get past the formidable guards and other obstacles that stand in your way.

One of the most exciting aspects of Hood Outlaws And Legends is the multiplayer gameplay. You and your friends can team up and work together to plan the perfect heist. Each player can choose their own character, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. You'll need to communicate effectively, coordinate your movements, and use all of your skills and tools to get the job done.

Of course, the guards won't make it easy. They are heavily armed and highly trained, and they will stop at nothing to protect the Crown Jewels. You'll need to use stealth, distraction, and your own weapons and abilities to get past them. If you do manage to get caught, you can fight your way out, but it won't be easy. The guards are tough, and they will swarm you if you're not careful.

But the rewards are great. The Crown Jewels of England are some of the most valuable treasures in the world, and you'll be able to sell them for a fortune. Of course, you'll need to get away first. The escape is just as important as the theft itself, and you'll need to plan your route carefully.

Hood Outlaws And Legends is coming to Xbox Series X, PS5, PC, Xbox One, and PS4 in 2021. It promises to be one of the most exciting and innovative multiplayer games of the year, with stunning graphics, intense action, and plenty of opportunities for cooperation and competition.

So get ready to plan the heist of a lifetime. Gather your friends, choose your characters, and prepare to steal the Crown Jewels with Hood Outlaws And Legends. It's time to become the ultimate thief and claim your place in history. Are you ready to take on the challenge?


In Hood: Outlaws & Legends you will carry out raids in the dark Middle Ages. You can decide whether you will go down in history as an outlaw or as a legend.
 
Focus Home Interactive and Sumo Digital used yesterday’s State of Play to unveil the multiplayer action game Hood: Outlaws & Legends. In the course of the coming year, the release for the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam) will be published.
 
In Hood: Outlaws & Legends you will fight for a place among the legends in a merciless, uncontrolled state with rebels and villains. Rival gangs try to gain influence among the oppressed people by perpetrating dangerous robberies on the rich.
 
There is also immense wealth to be gained by assembling a team of outlaws to wreak havoc on the oppressive government in this dark and violent medieval world. Players can expect a PvPvE multiplayer action game where two teams of players compete against each other to carry out the perfect heist.
 
However, deadly AI guards are also waiting for the players in the area to protect the riches. You will have to use the unique skills and mystical abilities of each character in order to achieve success either quietly and secretly or by force of weapons.
 
After the release, the developers would also like to regularly offer new maps, characters, game modes, and events. As soon as more details are revealed, we will update you. Check the first trailer of the game below.
