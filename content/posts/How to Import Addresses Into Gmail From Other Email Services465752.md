Gmail is one of the most popular email services in the world, and it offers a lot of features that other email services lack. One of its most useful features is the ability to quickly and easily migrate all your email contacts to your Gmail account.

Here’s how to do it:

## Step 1: Export Your Contacts From Your Current Email Service

The first step in the process is to export your contacts from your current email service. You can do this by logging into your email account and finding the option to export contacts.

Depending on your email service, this option may be available in different places. For example, in Gmail, you can find this option in the "Contacts" section of your account. In Yahoo Mail, you can go to the "Contacts" tab and click "Actions" and "Export."

Once you've found the option to export your contacts, follow the instructions to download your contacts as a CSV file.

## Step 2: Import Your Contacts Into Gmail

The next step is to import your contacts into your Gmail account. To do this, log into your Gmail account and go to the "Contacts" section.

In the "Contacts" section, you'll see an option to "Import." Click on that option and select the CSV file that you downloaded in Step 1.

Follow the instructions to upload your CSV file and import your email contacts into your Gmail account.

## Step 3: Clean Up Your Contacts

After importing your contacts into Gmail, you may notice that some contacts are duplicated or contain outdated information. To clean up your contacts, click on "More" in the "Contacts" section and select "Find and merge duplicates."

This will automatically find any duplicate contacts and allow you to merge them into one contact. You can also manually edit each contact to update their information if necessary.

This article explains how to export contacts from Yahoo Mail and Outlook.com and how to import them into Gmail.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Before importing contacts, you must export them from their current location to a CSV file.To import, go to Gmail, open Contacts, select Import > Select File, find the CSV file, and select Import.

 
##   Exporting Your Contacts  
 

When you send an email, Gmail automatically remembers every recipient. These addresses show up in your Gmail Contacts list, and Gmail auto-completes them when you write a new message.

 

Still, you have to enter the email address at least once. With all your contacts already in an address book at Yahoo Mail, Outlook, or Mac OS X Mail, is this really necessary? No, because you can import addresses into Gmail from your other email accounts.

 

To import addresses into Gmail, you first need to get them out of your current address book and in CSV format. Although it sounds sophisticated, a CSV file is really just a plain text file with addresses and names that are separated by commas.

 
###   Exporting Yahoo Mail Contacts  
 

Some email services make it simple to export your contacts in a CSV format. For example, to export your address book in Yahoo Mail:

 
- Open Yahoo Mail.
 - Click the Contacts icon at the top of the right side panel.
 - Place a checkmark in front of the contacts you want to export or place a checkmark in the box at the top of the list to select all contacts.
 - Select Actions at the top of the contact list and select Export from the menu that appears.
 - Select Yahoo CSV from the menu that opens and click Export Now.

 
###   Exporting Outlook.com Contacts  
 

To export your address book in Outlook.com:

 

Open Yahoo Mail.

 

Click the Contacts icon at the top of the right side panel. 

 

Place a checkmark in front of the contacts you want to export or place a checkmark in the box at the top of the list to select all contacts.

 

Select Actions at the top of the contact list and select Export from the menu that appears.

 

Select Yahoo CSV from the menu that opens and click Export Now.

 
- Go to Outlook.com in a web browser.
 - Select the People icon at the bottom of the left panel.
 - Click Manage at the top of the contacts list.
 - Select Export Contacts from the drop-down menu.
 - Select either All contacts or a specific contacts folder. The default format is Microsoft Outlook CSV.

 

Some email clients make it a little more difficult to export to a CSV file. Apple Mail doesn't supply a direct export in CSV format, but a utility called Address Book to CSV Exporter allows users to export their Mac Contacts in a CSV file. Look for AB2CSV in the Mac App Store.

 

Go to Outlook.com in a web browser.

 

Select the People icon at the bottom of the left panel.

 

Click Manage at the top of the contacts list.

 

Select Export Contacts from the drop-down menu.

 

Select either All contacts or a specific contacts folder. The default format is Microsoft Outlook CSV.

 

Some email clients export a CSV file that lacks the descriptive headers Google needs to import the contacts. In this case, you can open the exported CSV file in either a spreadsheet program or a plain text editor and add them. The headers are First Name, Last Name, Email Address and so on.

 
##   Import Addresses Into Gmail  
 

After you have the exported CSV file, importing the addresses into your Gmail contact list is easy:

 
- Open Contacts in Gmail.
 - Select Import from the left panel.
 - In the Import dialog box, click Select File, then find the CSV file holding your exported contacts.
 - Choose Import.

 

Open Contacts in Gmail.

 

Select Import from the left panel.

 

In the Import dialog box, click Select File, then find the CSV file holding your exported contacts.

 

Choose Import.
