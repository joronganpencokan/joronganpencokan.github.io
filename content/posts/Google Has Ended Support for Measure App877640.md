Attention all tech wizards! Say goodbye to Google's Measure App with its unexpected end of support - Here's the scoop!

For those who don't know, Google Measure is an app developed by Google that allows you to use augmented reality technology to measure lengths, areas, and volumes of objects in the real world using your smartphone camera. It was first introduced in 2014 but was re-released as an ARCore app in 2018.

Unfortunately, Google has recently announced that they will no longer support the Measure App. This news has shocked many tech enthusiasts who have enjoyed using the app to measure various objects and spaces with ease.

The announcement was made on December 21, 2020, through Google's support page, which stated that the Measure App will no longer receive any updates or support, and will be removed from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store on June 30, 2021.

This sudden discontinuation has left many users wondering why Google decided to terminate the Measure App. Google has not provided any official statement as to why they have decided to end support for this app. However, it is speculated that Google may have stopped supporting the app because they are focusing on other technologies that are more profitable.

This announcement has also brought about questions regarding Google's commitment to developing ARCore technologies as a whole. Some people are worried that if Google can suddenly discontinue a popular app like Measure, they may do the same to other ARCore apps in the future.

What does this mean for users of the Measure App? Well, for starters, it means that you will no longer be able to download or update the app after June 30, 2021. This will also mean that users will have to find alternative AR measurement apps to use.

There are many other AR measurement apps available on the market that you can use instead of the Measure App. Some popular ones include AR Ruler, EasyMeasure, and AirMeasure. These apps offer similar features to the Measure App, such as measuring lengths, areas, and volumes using AR technology.

In conclusion, Google's sudden discontinuation of the Measure App has left many tech enthusiasts disappointed. However, it is essential to remember that there are many other AR measurement apps available that can be used instead. It remains to be seen what Google's plans are for ARCore technologies in the future. Nonetheless, for now, tech wizards will have to bid a farewell to Google's Measure App and look for another alternative.

Measure, Google’s augmented reality-based measurement application, is the latest casualty in the company’s history of killing off apps.

 

It is not unusual for companies the size of Google to cancel apps and features, especially as technology continues to advance. The latest app to take the fall is Measure, an AR-based app that Google originally released as part of its Tango AR platform in 2016. Android Police was the first to spot Measure’s demise, reporting that the app no longer appears in the Play Store. Additionally, Android Police also reports that users who already have the app will see a message in the app stating that support for it has ended.

 

Despite being released in 2016, Measure has had a shaky go of things over the past several years. In 2018, Google killed off Tango, making Measure work as a standalone app on any device that utilized ARCore, the company’s primary AR development kit. That same year also brought vertical measurements to the application, though development appeared to slow shortly after.

 

The idea behind Measure was simple. Users could use their camera to point and measure different items by drawing lines on the screen. Unfortunately, Measure was not the most accurate measurement system ever, which led to poor ratings on the Google Play Store.

 

Android Police says that the app should continue to work if users already have it installed, though no additional fixes for crashes or bugs will be released.
