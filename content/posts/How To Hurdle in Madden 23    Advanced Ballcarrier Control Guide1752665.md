Unleash Your Inner Football Pro with This Insane Trick to Hurdle Defenders like a Champ in Madden 23!

If you're looking to take Madden 23 to the next level, you'll want to master the art of hurdling defenders. Hurdling is a move that allows you to jump over defenders, leaving them in your dust and giving you an advantage in the game.

To become a pro at hurdling, you need to know the right techniques and tactics. Here's a guide on how to master this move and unleash your inner football pro on the virtual field.

Timing is key:

Timing is crucial when it comes to hurdling. You need to time your jump just right to make the move effective. Don't be too early or too late, or you'll miss the opportunity to jump over the defender.

To time your jump, you should hold down the "LT/L2" button to activate the hurdle animation when you see a defender coming towards you. You'll want to release the button right before you reach the defender. This will give you enough momentum to jump over them.

Master the art of juking:

Juking is an essential move that works hand in hand with hurdling. Juking makes it easier for you to avoid defenders and position yourself for the jump.

To juke, use the right stick on your controller to quickly move left or right. This will cause your player to change direction and dodge the defender. Once you've juked, get ready to hurdle.

Use player attributes to your advantage:

Different players have different attributes that affect their ability to hurdle. For instance, players with higher jumping and agility stats will be more successful at hurdling than others.

When playing Madden 23, make sure you choose the right players to execute the move. Look for players with the highest jumping and agility stats to ensure success.

Practice, practice, practice:

Like any other skill, hurdling takes practice. The more you practice, the more you'll perfect the move and become a pro at it.

To practice hurdling, set up a single-player game in Madden 23 and practice the move over and over again. Try different techniques, practice timing and juking, and develop your own unique style to make the move work for you.

In conclusion, hurdling is a move that can give you a significant advantage in Madden 23. By mastering the timing, juking, and player attribute techniques, you can become a pro at the move and unleash your inner football pro on the virtual field. So, practice hard, choose the right players, and get ready to launch yourself over those pesky defenders like a champion!
