# Unleash the Power of Helios Flare in God of War Ragnarok with This Simple Guide!

The God of War series has been one of the most popular video game franchises for years. The latest installment, God of War Ragnarok, has been eagerly awaited by fans all over the world. One of the most powerful moves in the game is the Helios Flare, an ability that can decimate any enemy in your path. This guide will take you through the steps to unleash the full power of Helios Flare and dominate God of War Ragnarok.

## Step 1: Unlock Helios Flare

Before you can harness the power of Helios Flare, you must unlock it. This move is unlocked by completing one of the game's main missions, titled "The Light of Alfheim." Once you have completed this mission, you will have unlocked the move and can begin practicing its execution.

## Step 2: Upgrade Your Skills and Equipment

Upgrading your skills and equipment is crucial if you want to use Helios Flare to its full potential. Investing in certain skill branches, such as the Light Arrows branch, will increase the effectiveness of Helios Flare. Upgrading your weapons and armor will also make you stronger, giving you a better chance of taking down tougher enemies.

## Step 3: Build Up Your Runes

Runes are special items you can equip on your weapons and armor to add new abilities to your character. Building up your runes can drastically increase the power and versatility of your attacks. Some good runes to equip for use with Helios Flare include the Eye of the Winged Chosen and the Tale of the Nine Realms.

## Step 4: Practice Makes Perfect

There is no shortcut to mastering Helios Flare – it takes practice. The move is executed by performing a certain button sequence on your controller, and it can be tricky to get the timing just right. Spend some time in the game's training area practicing the move until you can execute it with ease.

## Step 5: Unleash the Power of Helios Flare

Once you have unlocked Helios Flare, upgraded your equipment, built up your runes, and perfected your execution, it's time to unleash the power of the move. Helios Flare is an area-of-effect attack that can take out multiple enemies at once. To use the move, perform the button sequence on your controller while in combat. The move will create a huge explosion of light that damages enemies and stuns them for a short time, giving you an opening to land even more devastating attacks.

In conclusion, mastering Helios Flare in God of War Ragnarok requires a combination of unlocking the move, upgrading your skills and equipment, building up your runes, practicing your execution, and finally unleashing the move in combat. With these steps, you will be able to take down any enemy that stands in your way and dominate the world of God of War Ragnarok.
