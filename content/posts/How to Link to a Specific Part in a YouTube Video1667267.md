#Unlock the Hidden Secret to Directly Linking to a Specific Moment in Any YouTube Video!

If you are a YouTube fanatic, you might have come across a situation where you want to direct someone to a particular moment in a video. For this, you may have given lengthy instructions on where to skip or fast forward to get to that specific moment of the video. Well, there is a hidden secret that can save you time and frustration while navigating through YouTube videos.

The good news is that you can directly link to a specific moment in any YouTube video by using a simple URL structure. This trick works for both desktop and mobile versions of YouTube.

Below is the structure of the URL that you can use to directly link to a specific time in any YouTube video:

```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEOID&t=TIMEINSECONDS
```

Replace the "VIDEOID" with the actual ID of the video you want to share. You can find the video ID by checking the URL of the video. For instance, the video ID in the URL below is "dQw4w9WgXcQ"

```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

The "TIMEINSECONDS" should be replaced with the number of seconds you want the video to start playing at. For instance, if you want the video to start playing at the 1:35 minute mark, you would use the number of seconds equivalent to that time (1 minute and 35 seconds) which is 95.

Below is an example of how the complete URL would look like if we wanted to directly link to a specific time in the video with ID "dQw4w9WgXcQ," starting at 1 minute and 35 seconds:

```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&t=95
```

Now that you know how to use the URL structure to directly link to a specific moment in any YouTube video, you can make things easier for yourself and for others. You can easily share the exact moment in a video with your friends, family or clients. This is especially useful for video tutorials, how-to videos, or even to share a funny moment in a video.

In conclusion, the hidden secret to directly linking to a specific moment in any YouTube video is simple and easy to use. Don't waste time navigating through lengthy videos or giving instructions on where to fast forward; use the tip above and save time.

This article explains how to link to a specific part of a YouTube video using the Share feature or by adding a timestamp. These steps pertain to desktop users only. All browsers are supported.

 
### 
What To Know
 
- Easiest: Open the YouTube video > cue it to the point you want to share > press Share > copy the URL, and send it.Manually: Open the YouTube video, and copy the URL. Then, add &t= with the time, like &t=1m30s. For shortened URLs, use ?t= instead.

 
##   Create a YouTube Link With a Timestamp Using the Share Feature  
 

The simplest method is to add a timestamp using YouTube's sharing options.

 
- Open the YouTube video you want to share and play it or move through the timeline until you reach the exact moment you want to use in the timestamp.
 - Stop the video.
 - Click the Share button to open the sharing pop-up.
 - Select the checkbox under the URL that says Start at, and optionally adjust the time if it isn't correct.
 - Lifewire
 - Copy the updated shortened URL with the timestamp appended.
 - Share this new URL, and anyone who clicks it sees the video beginning at the timestamp you specified. For example, in The Goonies video, the URL might look like this: https://youtu.be/5qA2s_Vh0uE?t=38s.

 
##   Manually Add a Timestamp to a YouTube URL  
 

To add a timestamp manually, open the YouTube video in your browser, then locate the URL for this video in your browser's address bar. This is the URL that shows near the top of the browser window when you're watching a video on YouTube.

 

Open the YouTube video you want to share and play it or move through the timeline until you reach the exact moment you want to use in the timestamp.

 

Stop the video.

 

Click the Share button to open the sharing pop-up.

 

Select the checkbox under the URL that says Start at, and optionally adjust the time if it isn't correct.

 

Copy the updated shortened URL with the timestamp appended.

 

Share this new URL, and anyone who clicks it sees the video beginning at the timestamp you specified. For example, in The Goonies video, the URL might look like this: https://youtu.be/5qA2s_Vh0uE?t=38s.

 

Depending on the URL, there are two ways to add a timestamp to the video:

 
- &t=1m30s or?t=1m30s

 

Use the ampersand example if the URL includes a question mark, like if it ends in

 

watch?v=Sf5FfA1j590.

 

Short URLs that are listed as youtu.be don't have a question mark, so those would need to use the second example above.

 

Here are two examples that jump to the same point in the video (using the two different timestamp options from above):

 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf5FfA1j590&t=1h10shttps://youtu.be/Sf5FfA1j590?t=1h10s

 

The time you choose can be anything: hours, minutes, or seconds. If the video should be started at 56 minutes in, t=56m is all you need to include. If it should be 12 minutes and 12 seconds, t=12m12s is how you'd write it. A 2-hour, 5-second timestamp can skip the minute field altogether: t=2h5s.
