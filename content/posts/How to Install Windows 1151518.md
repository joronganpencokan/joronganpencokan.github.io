Before proceeding with the installation, it is recommended to back up all your personal files and data. You can use an external hard drive or cloud storage services to create a backup of your important files. This will ensure that you don't lose any data during the upgrade process.

Select the option to boot from the USB drive and follow the on-screen instructions to start the installation process.

Step 5: Install Windows 11

Once you have booted from the USB drive, the Windows installation process will begin. You will be prompted to select the language, time zone, and other settings.
