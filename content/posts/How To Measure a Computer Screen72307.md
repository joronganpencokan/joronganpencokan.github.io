# Measure Your Computer Screen Like A Pro In Just 3 Easy Steps!

As more and more people are adopting a work-from-home setup or engaging in online classes, having a computer screen that suits your needs is just as important as owning a reliable computer set. But before you can upgrade your computer screen, it is crucial to measure it properly. In this article, we will walk you through the process of measuring your computer screen like a pro in just three easy steps using the Hugo writing format.

## Step 1: Find the diagonal measurement of your screen

The first step in measuring your computer screen is to find its diagonal measurement or its screen size. To do this, measure the distance from one corner of your screen to the opposite corner, using a measuring tape or a ruler. Ensure that you measure the screen only and not the border surrounding it. 

Once you have the measurement, write it down and make sure it is in inches. Most computer screens come in standard sizes, so be sure to check online which size category your screen falls into. This information will be useful when you shop for a new computer screen.

## Step 2: Determine your screen's aspect ratio 

The aspect ratio of a computer screen refers to its proportional relationship between its width and height. Two of the most common aspect ratios are 4:3 and 16:9. Determining your computer screen's aspect ratio is important, especially when selecting a new screen or when you are working on projects with specific resolutions.

To determine the aspect ratio of your computer screen, measure the width and height of your screen, again omitting the border. Write down these measurements and then divide the width by the height. If the result is close to 1.33, then your screen has an aspect ratio of 4:3 or a similar ratio. If the result is close to 1.78, then your screen has a 16:9 aspect ratio. 

## Step 3: Check your computer's display settings

The last step is to check your computer's display settings to confirm the screen size and aspect ratio you obtained. Different operating systems have varying ways to check display settings but typically you can find this option under display settings. Double-checking these settings is crucial, as it will ensure that the computer is using the correct resolution and aspect ratio for your screen. 

Now that you have your computer screen's correct measurements, you can confidently look for a new screen that perfectly fits your needs or customize your computer settings to take advantage of your screen's abilities. Remember to follow these easy steps whenever you measure your computer screen, and you'll feel like a pro in no time!

This article explains how to measure a computer screen using a tape measure or a simple mathematical equation.

What To Know
 
- Screen size is the diagonal length from the top corner to the opposite bottom corner. It is measured in inches and is different from screen resolution, which is in pixels.Do not include the bezel around the screen when measuring the size.

 
##   How To Measure Monitor Size With a Measuring Tape  
 

Desktop computers and laptops come in different screen sizes. It is as essential as screen resolution as it is critical to productivity. The correct measurement can also help you figure out the size of a screen filter you need to buy.

 

Screen size is the actual physical size of the screen and is in inches. The simplest method to measure a computer monitor is with a measuring tape or a ruler. 

 

The computer or the laptop manual will mention the monitor size. Manufacturers sometimes display it on a sticker on the device. But if you can’t spot it anywhere, you can measure the size of your existing monitor or a new one you are interested in buying with the help of a measuring tape. 

 
- Use a measuring tape of sufficient length.
 - Start at the top-left corner and extend it along the diagonal to the opposite bottom-right. If you start from the top-right corner, pull it straight to the bottom-left corner.

 - Measure only the screen and not the bezel or the casing around the screen.
 - The diagonal measure is the screen size.

 
##   How To Measure Monitor Size With Simple Math  
 

The Pythagorean theorem is an alternative method to measure a computer monitor. It states in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides. In a computer monitor, the hypotenuse is the diagonal measure that gives you the screen size. 

 

Use a measuring tape of sufficient length.

 

Start at the top-left corner and extend it along the diagonal to the opposite bottom-right. If you start from the top-right corner, pull it straight to the bottom-left corner.

 

Measure only the screen and not the bezel or the casing around the screen.

 

The diagonal measure is the screen size.

Note:
 
An online search is the fastest way to find the precise size of the computer monitor. Type the make of your computer monitor or laptop and any model number that tail them in a search engine, and you will get the detailed specifications with the screen size. You can also get these details from the manufacturer’s website.
 

Measure the width and height of the screen, square the screen’s width and the height, and add the two numbers together. Calculate the square root of this sum to get the diagonal measurement and the screen size. 

 

For instance, a Dell XPS 13 has a screen width of 11.57 inches and a height of 6.51 inches. 

 

Multiply the width by itself to get 133.8. Then multiply the height by itself to get 42.38. Add the two numbers together (133.8+42.38 =176.18). Find the square root of the sum (√176.18 = 13.27). 

 

13.3 inches is the advertised size of a Dell XPS 13 laptop monitor.

Tip:
 
There are online calculators like Omni Calculator that quickly estimate the dimensions with the diagonal, width, or height. Enter one, and it will automatically calculate the other two measurements.
