A virtual machine always starts with a default window size on VirtualBox, which is small and not ideal for navigating an operating system.
 
Usually, in the case of Windows 10, you would go to the “Display” settings to change the resolution to make the screen bigger or full screen, but you will quickly find out that the “Display resolution” option does not include many settings.
 
However, if you want to make a virtual machine running Windows 10 full screen, you have a couple of choices. You can use the “Full-screen Mode” option or use the “Auto-resize Guest Display” option. The first option will make the guest operating system full screen, meaning that the VM will take the entire screen as if it was the primary system. The second choice only stretches the virtual machine resolution based on the size of the window.
 
In this guide, you will learn the steps to stretch or full screen a virtual machine running Windows 10 on VirtualBox.

- Open VirtualBox.
