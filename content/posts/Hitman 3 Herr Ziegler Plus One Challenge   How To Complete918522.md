In this article, we'll give you some tips and tricks to help you complete this difficult challenge and become the ultimate assassin.

## What is the Herr Ziegler Plus One Challenge?

The Herr Ziegler Plus One Challenge is a mission in Hitman 3 that will put your assassination skills to the test. This challenge takes place in the "Berlin" level, and your goal is to eliminate the targets while wearing the Herr Ziegler outfit. The twist? You can only take out one target at a time. That means you'll need to plan your moves carefully and use all of your skills to eliminate all of the targets successfully.

## Expert Tips & Tricks for the Herr Ziegler Plus One Challenge

Here are some expert tips and tricks to help you complete the Herr Ziegler Plus One Challenge and prove that you have what it takes to be the ultimate assassin:

### 1. Use the Environment to Your Advantage

The Berlin level is full of opportunities to use the environment to your advantage. For example, you can lure one of your targets to a secluded area by throwing a coin, then take them out quickly and quietly. Look for opportunities to use weapons like propane tanks and fire extinguishers to create accidents that take out your targets.

### 2. Plan Your Moves Carefully

As mentioned earlier, you can only take out one target at a time in this challenge. That means you'll need to plan your moves carefully to avoid getting caught by the other targets or guards. Use your instincts to get a feel for the movements of the targets and the guards and plan your moves accordingly.

### 3. Be Creative with Your Kills

One of the most fun aspects of Hitman is coming up with creative ways to take out your targets. In this challenge, you'll need to be even more creative since you can only take out one target at a time. Look for opportunities to use poison, disguise yourself as a guard, or find other unique ways to take out your targets.

### 4. Use the Disguises to Your Advantage

The Herr Ziegler outfit is just one of the many disguises available in the Berlin level. You'll need to use the other disguises to your advantage to take out the targets. For example, you can dress up as a member of the band to get closer to one of your targets, or disguise yourself as a bartender to get access to a locked room.

### 5. Practice, Practice, Practice!

The Herr Ziegler Plus One Challenge is not an easy one, and it will likely take you a few tries to complete it successfully. Don't get discouraged if you fail the first time. Practice your moves and tweaks your strategy until you feel confident enough to take on the challenge.

## Final Thoughts

The Herr Ziegler Plus One Challenge is a fun and challenging addition to Hitman 3's already exciting gameplay. With these expert tips and tricks, you'll be well on your way to completing the challenge and proving that you are the ultimate assassin. Happy hunting!
