With the rise of social media and messaging apps, WhatsApp has become an essential communication tool in our daily lives. However, one thing that annoys most users is being added to a group without their consent. Whether it's a family group chat or a work-related discussion, sometimes you just want out. But exiting a group can be tricky, especially if you don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. 

That's why we've come up with some revolutionary hacks to exit a WhatsApp group without causing a scene. These hacks are so simple, you won't believe you haven't thought of them before!

**HACK 1: Create your own WhatsApp Group**

The easiest way to exit a WhatsApp group is to create your own group and invite the members you want to stay connected with. This way, you can control who is part of the group, and you won't have to deal with unwanted messages anymore. Plus, you'll have a smaller group of people, making it easier to have meaningful conversations. 

**HACK 2: Mute notifications**

If you don't want to leave the group but want to stop receiving notifications, you can mute the group. This way, you won't receive any notifications, and the group won't appear on your home screen. To do this, you can simply press and hold on the group, select mute notifications, and choose the time period you want to mute them for. 

**HACK 3: Turn off read receipts**

If you're worried about hurting someone's feelings by not responding to their messages, you can turn off read receipts. This way, the members won't know whether or not you've read their messages, giving you more time to respond. To turn off read receipts, go to settings, select privacy, and turn off the toggle switch for read receipts. 

**HACK 4: Leave silently**

If you want to leave a group without drawing attention to yourself, you can do so silently. To do this, you can simply go to the group, click on the three dots in the top right corner, and select Exit Group. Then, select the option to "Leave silently," and no one will know that you've left the group. 

In conclusion, these hacks will make your WhatsApp experience more enjoyable and give you more control over your conversations. Remember, communication is essential, but so is respecting each other's boundaries. So if you want to exit a group, do it with these revolutionary hacks without causing a scene.
