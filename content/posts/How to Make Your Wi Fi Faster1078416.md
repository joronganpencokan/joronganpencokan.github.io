Transform Your Slow Wi-Fi into Lightning Fast Internet with These Simple Tricks!

Are you tired of buffering, slow downloads, and poor Wi-Fi connections? Do you struggle to get your work done or enjoy streaming your favorite shows because of a poor internet connection? Thankfully, there are several simple tricks you can use to quickly transform your slow Wi-Fi into lightning-fast internet. In this article, we will explore some of these tricks that can help you improve your Wi-Fi connection.

1. Check Your Router Placement

The position of your router can significantly affect the strength and speed of your Wi-Fi connection. Ideally, you should place your router in a central location that is free from obstructions such as walls, furniture, and appliances. Also, avoid placing it near other wireless devices, including cordless phones, baby monitors, and Bluetooth speakers. These gadgets can interfere and weaken your Wi-Fi signal.

2. Update Your Router's Firmware

Your router's firmware acts as the software that manages your Wi-Fi network. Like most software, firmware updates are required to improve your router's speed, security, and stability. Check your router manufacturer's website or the manual that came with the router to find out how to update your firmware. It's important to note that firmware updates are different from updating your router's password or SSID.

3. Install Wi-Fi Range Extenders

If you work or live in a large space or a multi-story building, you may need more than one router to get adequate Wi-Fi coverage. Wi-Fi range extenders can help improve signal strength by amplifying your router's signal. They work by repeating your router's signal and relaying it to areas that have poor signal strength. Ensure that the Wi-Fi extender is compatible with your router and that it's placed in an area with a weak signal.

4. Optimize Your Wi-Fi Settings

Your router's settings can also affect your Wi-Fi speed. Some settings, such as the type of encryption and the channel used, can affect the speed and stability of your Wi-Fi connection. Use your router's administrator console to check your Wi-Fi settings and ensure they're optimized for speed. For example, switch to the 5GHz band, enable Quality of Service (QoS), and disable any unused features.

5. Use Ethernet cable

If you need a more stable and direct connection than Wi-Fi can offer, use an Ethernet cable to connect your device to your router. An Ethernet cable can offer faster speeds, lower latency, and a more reliable connection than Wi-Fi. Ideally, you should use a cat 5e cable or higher for optimal performance.

Conclusion

By following the above simple tricks, you can significantly improve your Wi-Fi speed and signal strength. You'll enjoy faster downloads, smoother streaming, and better coverage. Though, you may also want to consider upgrading to a newer router, especially if your current one is more than four years old. A newer router can offer better Wi-Fi coverage, faster speeds, and improved security features. With these solutions, you can now enjoy lightning-fast internet speeds from the comfort of your home or workspace.

This article explains how to reposition your router, change the router channel, and install a Wi-Fi extender to speed up your home wireless network.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- The quickest way to speed up a Wi-Fi network is by moving the router to a central, unobstructed location.Switch between channels 1, 6, and 11 to find one that's not congested.Still no improvement? Get a range extender if moving the router or switching channels doesn't work.

 
##   Speed Things Up by Repositioning the Router  
 

It sounds almost too simple to be true but the placement of your router can make all the difference between fast Wi-Fi and lousy Wi-Fi. Consider the quality of the signal and how hard it is for that to reach the devices requiring Wi-Fi access. Always place a router in an unobstructed location.

 

If a router is in a closed cabinet, in the corner of a room, or several walls away from your computer, for example, the signal will be immediately degraded, even if it's in a central location. Here's how to reposition a router:

 
- Disconnect the router from its current location.
 - Move the router to a central location to improve the Wi-Fi signal.
 - Use temporary wiring to see if it helps before tidying up the cables as a more long-term solution.
 - Turn on the router then move from room to room with your smartphone, tablet or laptop to see the number of Wi-Fi bars on the device. If they've improved, your connection is better than before and you should make the new placement a more permanent solution.
 - Another helpful way of boosting the signal is to place your router somewhere raised. Routers typically spread their signal downwards so it's best if the device is on a raised surface to begin with.

 
##   Get Faster Wi-Fi By Changing the Channel on the Router  
 

Routers divide up Wi-Fi signal into different channels. By default, they tend to pick out what's considered the best and most popular option but that can be a disadvantage. If your neighbors are also using their Wi-Fi on the same channel, the channel can become congested and things begin to slow down.

Before getting started, you might want to do an internet speed test to find out where you're starting before performing the actions below.

 
Some newer and more advanced routers automatically choose the least crowded channel. Check your router manual to see if your router already does this.
 
- On your router, log into the router administration page and look for something referring to wireless channels.
 - Typically, 2.4GHz routers use channels 1, 6 and 11. You can use an analyzer tool to find out whether those channels are congested before changing them accordingly.
 - Some routers offer dual-band technology where you can also choose to use the 5GHz spectrum which is often less frequently used so tends to be faster than 2.4GHz.
 - The 5GHz frequency is more susceptible to physical objects slowing it down. Only use the 5GHz frequency if your router has a clear path to all your devices.
 - Once you've changed channels or spectrum, use an internet speed test site to check your connection has actually improved.

 
##   Improve the Signal With a Range Extender  
 

Notice how the location of your router makes a huge difference to the connection speed of your Wi-Fi? If it's not possible to easily move your router or your home is still too large, you can use a range extender to expand the coverage in your home. Wi-Fi range is a key component to making your Wi-Fi work more smoothly. Here's a quick overview of how to extend the range.

- Buy a Wi-Fi range extender. There are many different devices out there covering different budgets and requirements. It's important you buy the right one for your situation.

 - Place the Wi-Fi range extender at a location in your home that's halfway between the current Wi-Fi router and the area with the weakest signal.
 - Log into the extender and follow the instructions that come with it to make it work with your existing router.
 - If you prefer a more advanced solution, you can replace your extender with a mesh network, which would most likely solve your problem with better coverage.
