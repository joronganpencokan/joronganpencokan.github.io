The keyboard is an essential part of any computer, and Apple has always been known for its premium quality keyboards. However, not everyone is aware of the hidden powers of a Mac keyboard. In this article, we’ll reveal a quick command key hack that can unlock a whole new set of powers on your Mac keyboard.

Before we dive into the hack, let’s first understand the command key. The command key, also known as the “Apple key," is a modifier key on Apple keyboards. It is denoted by the ⌘ symbol and is used in combination with other keys to execute specific commands. Most Mac users are already familiar with basic command key shortcuts, such as ⌘+C to copy, ⌘+V to paste, ⌘+X to cut, etc.

Now, let's reveal the hack and how it can unlock hidden powers on a Mac keyboard. The trick is to hold down the command key for a few seconds until a drop-down menu appears. The menu displays a list of keyboard shortcuts for various functions, some of which are not commonly known or used.

For instance, did you know that you could take a screenshot of a specific area of the screen using the keyboard? Simply hold down the command key and select Shift+4 from the drop-down menu. The cursor will turn into a crosshair, and you can drag it across the screen to select the area you want to capture.

Another hidden power of a Mac keyboard is the ability to quickly lock the screen. Hold down the command key and select Control+Shift+Power from the drop-down menu, and the screen will lock immediately, preventing anyone from accessing your computer.

The list of hidden powers that can be unlocked using the command key hack is vast, ranging from accessing hidden menu options to searching for specific functions on your computer. Once you become familiar with the command key and its hidden powers, you will save time and increase your productivity.

In conclusion, the Mac keyboard is packed with powerful features that most users aren’t aware of. By using the command key hack, you can unlock a treasure trove of capabilities that can increase your productivity and make your life easier. So go ahead, try the hack, and explore the hidden powers of your Mac keyboard!

Also: This free utility is so simple and useful, it should be shipped with every Mac
It was the fact that, for years, I had gotten so used to reaching over to the bottom-left corner of the keyboard for the Control key in order to select all (Ctrl+A,) copy (Ctrl+C,) paste (Ctrl+V,) and do all the other useful Windows-based shortcuts, that by the time I was presented with the MacBook's repositioned Control key alternative, the Command key, my muscle memory was beginning to question itself.
So what if I told you you can remap the Apple keyboard so that the Globe key, which is situated where the Control key is typically found on a Windows layout, serves as the Command key instead? Here's the lowdown.

(Even if you've always been a Mac user, and everything I just wrote meant nothing to you, you'll still want to read this. There's a good chance that the following remapping feature will benefit you just as much, too.)

## How this helps


From a Windows user perspective, being able to still access my usual keyboard shortcuts -- and by usual I mean ones I use dozens of times a day -- without searching for the right combination of keys increases my productivity. It's also a more natural and effortless action to shift my pinky downward to press and hold the new Command key versus tucking my thumb underneath my hand to hit the old one.
You can also access this menu by clicking the Apple icon on the top left of the status bar > System Preferences > and then Keyboard.
Note: There is a "Control key" on the Mac keyboard but it doesn't function the same as that on Windows. The Command key is the direct alternative.
