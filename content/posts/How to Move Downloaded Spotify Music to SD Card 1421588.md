Title: You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Transfer Your Spotify Music to an SD Card! Find Out Now!

Are you someone who loves to listen to music on the go? Chances are you own a device that doesn't allow you to store all the music you want. This is where SD cards come into play, and with Spotify's offline feature, moving your music to an SD card has never been easier. 

Here are the simple steps to follow:

Step 1: Insert your SD card into your device

Your device should have an SD card slot. Check your device's manual if you're not sure. Then, insert the SD card and wait for it to be recognized by the device.

Step 2: Set Spotify to download music to your SD card

Spotify allows you to set where you want to download your songs. To do this, open the app and go to settings. Scroll down to "Storage" and select "SD Card" as your preferred download location.

Step 3: Download music to your SD card

Now comes the fun part! Find the songs or playlists you want to download and tap the "Download" icon (the down arrow with a horizontal line underneath it) next to the song or playlist. Wait for the download to complete, and voila! Your favorite songs are now stored on your SD card.

Step 4: Play your music

Eject your SD card from your device and insert it again into your device where you intend to play your music. Now, open the music app on your device and find the SD card. After this, search for the name of the playlist or song you downloaded to start playing it.

Conclusion

There you have it, the simplest steps to transfer your Spotify music to an SD card. This is a great way to save on storage space on your device and still have access to your favorite tunes. With Spotify's flexibility, it's now easier to enjoy your music wherever you go. Give it a try!

If you have a Spotify Premium subscription, you can download your favorite tracks to play offline. While this is useful, it can quickly eat up your phone’s storage. From time to time, it’s well worth reviewing your downloaded music and deleting any tracks you no longer listen to. This can help free up space on your mobile device. Here we show you how to manage your downloads using the Spotify mobile app for iOS and Android. 
 
If you’re an Android user, your device may support an external SD card, which gives you more options for storing your favorite tunes. If you have an Android smartphone or tablet with an external SD, we also show how to move your playlists onto this external SD card. This enables you to free up a ton of space without having to sacrifice any of your music.
 
## How to Delete Downloaded Spotify Songs on iPhone and Android
 
If you’ve downloaded songs via the Spotify app, it’s easy to delete these songs from your phone’s storage:
 
1. Launch the Spotify app on your mobile device.
 
2. Tap the “Your Library” tab.
 
3. Tap either “Playlists” or “Albums,” depending on the content you want to delete. All downloaded items will be displayed with a little green icon.
 
4. Tap the playlist or album you want to remove from your device’s internal storage.
 
5. Find the little green “Download” icon and give it a tap.
 
6. When prompted, tap “Remove.”
 
This album or playlist will now be deleted from your mobile device. Rinse and repeat for any additional music you want to remove from your internal storage. 
 
## Android Users: Move Your Music to an SD Card 
 
For Android users, it’s possible that Spotify may have saved your offline music to Android’s internal storage rather than your external SD card. In this scenario, you can move your Spotify music to an external SD card.  
 
Note: for Spotify to save music to an external SD card, the only requirement is that the remaining storage space in the SD card must be more than the phone’s internal storage. For example, if your SD card only has 4GB of space left and your phone’s internal storage has 5GB, Spotify will still save the offline music to your phone’s internal storage.
 
First, you have to clear all cached and offline music from your phone’s internal storage. To do that, open the Spotify app on your Android phone and tap the cog icon. This will launch Spotify’s Settings page.
 
Scroll all the way to the bottom of the screen. Here you should see the option “Delete cache and saved data.” Tap this option and select “OK.” This will delete all cached and saved data from the phone’s internal storage and log you out of Spotify.  
 
Using a file manager, navigate to the “Android -> data” path. Find the “com.spotify.music” folder and delete it.
 
Lastly, log back into the Spotify application on your phone and resume downloading your favorite playlists and albums ready for offline use. Using the file manager, you should see that your offline music is now saved to your external SD card (in the folder “Android -> data -> com.spotify.music -> files”).
