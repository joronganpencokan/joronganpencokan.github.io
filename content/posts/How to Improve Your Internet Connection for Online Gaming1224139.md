# Unleash Your Inner Champion: Master These Tips To Boost Internet Speed For Unstoppable Gaming Experience!

It's no secret that internet speed is crucial when it comes to gaming. Slow internet connectivity can result in lag time, game crashes, and lost matches. However, with the ongoing pandemic and increasing number of people working and studying from home, online traffic has surged, causing network congestion and reducing internet speeds.

But don't let this stop you from achieving your gaming goals. With these tips, you can unleash your inner champion and boost internet speed for an unstoppable gaming experience.

## Tip 1: Upgrade Your Internet Plan

The first step to improving internet speed is to upgrade your internet plan. Internet service providers (ISPs) typically offer different plans that accommodate various internet speeds, and you might not be subscribed to the best plan for your gaming needs. Check with your ISP to determine if a higher-tier plan is available in your area as this can provide a significant boost in speed.

## Tip 2: Optimize Your Router Placement

Where you place your router affects the quality of the internet connection. Place the router centrally in your home or gaming room to reduce signal interference and improve coverage range. Additionally, ensure that there are no barriers, such as walls or furniture, that could block the signal. 

## Tip 3: Check Your Wi-Fi Network for Lag

Wi-Fi speeds can be inconsistent due to interference from other wireless networks or physical obstructions such as walls. To reduce lag, try reducing the number of devices that are connected to the Wi-Fi network at one time. If possible, connect your gaming device directly to the router using an ethernet cable. This reduces signal interference and can provide more reliable and stable connectivity. 

## Tip 4: Use A VPN to Improve Speed

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a great tool that improves internet speed by reducing network congestion. VPNs work by redirecting your internet traffic through a secure private network, bypassing internet traffic from other users. This can greatly improve your online gaming experience, and most VPNs come with a significant reduction in lag time.

## Tip 5: Optimize Your Gaming Device Settings

Finally, optimizing your gaming device settings can impact internet speed. Ensure that gaming devices are updated with the latest software, and close down programs running in the background that are not being used. A good way to prioritize resources and streamline the process is through task manager. 

In conclusion, with these tips, you can unleash your inner champion and experience unstoppable gaming. Upgrading your internet plan, optimizing router placement, checking your Wi-Fi network, using a VPN, and optimizing gaming device settings can significantly improve your internet speed and provide a seamless gaming experience. So what are you waiting for? Level up your game today!

For almost two decades lag has been the killer of online gaming. You’ll have a strong streak where you are beating or gunning down your opponents and everything is going great. Then you suddenly can’t move your character, your shots are missing, and your team ends up losing a match because of your lag.
 
You may grumble about how you need to buy a stronger Internet connection, but that may not be true. Here are some key ways to know whether your connection is effective enough to play online and what you can do to improve things whether you are playing on a PC or your phone.
 
## The importance of Ping
 
Internet providers like Comcast advertise with their upload and download speeds, but those speeds actually are not that important for gaming. Most online games do not need more than one megabyte per second, and three will suffice for anything on the higher end.
 
Instead, gamers need to check their ping. Ping measures how quickly your computer can respond to data requests through the Internet. If you have a very high ping of 1000 ms (milliseconds), it means you are essentially playing a full second behind what everyone is doing. In games like Counter-strike or Call of Duty, that is catastrophic.
 
Furthermore, online servers will often boot people whose ping passes a certain threshold. While that threshold varies from server to server, 100 ms is a common number. If you have a high ping, then playing online games will be difficult regardless of what your download or upload speeds are.
 
## Finding out your Ping levels
 
You won’t find ping numbers located on any Internet subscription plan, meaning you will need to find it yourself.
 
The easiest method is to just use Speedtest.net. Click the “Test” button, let it run, and see what your ping is. A ping below 20 ms is ideal, while above 100 ms indicates that you need to change things to properly game online.
 

 
If you want to test your computer’s connectivity while playing a game, a lot of games, particularly first-person shooters, will show you your ping while you are playing. Even if it does not, the presence of overwhelming lag almost always indicates that your ping is too high to play that game, especially if you can play the game just fine offline. If you cannot play it well offline, your computer may not be advanced enough to play it.
 
## Fixing online connectivity
 
If you have confirmed that your ping is too high, how do you fix it? There are many things you can do for both your phone and computer.
 
The first step is to remove other programs or factors which may be burdening either your device or Internet connection in addition to the game. For a computer, close down any unnecessary background processes such as Internet browsers and torrent or streaming software. For a smartphone, close down background apps. And if you live with anyone else, their Internet usage can cut into bandwidth and degrade your ability to run online games. If multiple people are streaming or playing online games at the same time, the result can be that no one is actually having a good time playing them.
 
If cutting these programs does not work, you may have to look at cutting down on what the game is demanding for your computer. Lowering the visual settings means that your computer is sending less information to a server, which should reduce the amount of time it needs to get data back.
 
The second step is to take a look at your Wi-Fi router. As the Huffington Post notes, you should avoid surrounding your router with metal objects and should keep it away from concrete or brick walls. Also, try to place your gaming device near the router – or better yet, use an Ethernet cable to connect your computer directly to the router.
 
If this doesn’t work, then you can look at other programs, both for your phone and computer, which can give a boost. One of these programs is GameBooster.
 
However, such programs should be used only as a last resort. The first problem is that such programs can boost your computer past its limits which can have bad long-term results. But the bigger problem is that there are plenty of programs out there which promise to boost your computer but really plant malware. Knowing which boosting programs are legitimate and which are not can be difficult.
 
Lag is a killer, and it can be incredibly frustrating buying a new online game only to be unable to play it thanks to high ping. But using each of these above steps can help you play better without lag and ensure you actually enjoy yourself.
