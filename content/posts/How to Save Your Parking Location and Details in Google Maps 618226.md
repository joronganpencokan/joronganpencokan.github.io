Unlock The Secret To Never Losing Your Car Again: Here's How To Save Your Parking Details In Google Maps!

Losing your car in a parking lot is one of the most frustrating experiences. It can make you late for appointments or meetings, cause anxiety and leave you wandering around aimlessly. The good news is that with Google Maps, you can now save your parking location and never lose your car again.

We all know how difficult it can be to find your car in a large parking lot or crowded city street. With many cars of the same make and model parked in the same vicinity, it can take you hours to find your car, and by then you might have given up hope altogether.

Fortunately, Google Maps has an easy-to-use feature that helps you save your parking location, making it easy to find your car again. By following the steps below, you can save your parking location and never waste time looking for your car again.

Step 1:

Before you leave your parking spot, open Google Maps on your smartphone or tablet. Ensure that you have location services turned on.

Step 2:

Tap the blue dot that represents your current position on the map. A blue dot will appear in the center of the map, indicating your current location.

Step 3:

Tap on the blue dot, and a menu will appear giving you the option to "Save your parking." Tap that option, and Google Maps will save your parking location, which will show up as a small blue P icon on the map.

Step 4:

In addition to saving your parking location, Google Maps also allows you to add notes and photos to help you remember where you parked. For example, you can add the floor level or section of the parking lot where your car is parked or a picture of a nearby landmark that would help you identify it later.

Step 5:

When you are ready to find your car again, open Google Maps and tap the blue P icon, followed by "Directions." Google Maps will guide you directly to where your car is parked.

In conclusion, Google Maps can be your best friend when it comes to finding your parked car. By saving your parking location and adding notes and photos, you can make the process of finding your car hassle-free. No need to waste your time wandering around a parking lot again, as the solution is right at your fingertips.

To overcome this, Google Maps recently, in a beta rollout, received the ability for the user to manually feed in the parking location and not blindly rely on the service to automatically make note of this. Here’s how you can use it.


 
## Steps to Manually Save Parking Location on Google Maps
 

First and foremost, head over to this link and sign up for Google Maps’ beta program. Next, update the app from the play store for downloading the version 9.49.
Now, launch the app, and tap the current location white icon present on the bottom left. Click the blue icon on the map.
A menu will pop up revealing four options. Tap “Save your parking”.
Your parking has been added. For adding further details, touch the white bar which showed up or swipe up from the bottom.
Here, you can add notes such as the parking number, time left for the parking meter, and even photos if you’d like to store the spot or just capture the receipt. Additionally, you can also share the location with someone else.
You’re done. Google Maps will add a notification whenever you are near that location or you can find that entry by tapping the search bar in the app.
If you want to delete the parking location, head over to the app and click the search bar. Select the “Parking location” and press “Clear”. That’s it.



That’s about it for this quick tip. This is definitely a long overdue addition for Google Maps as I personally never found the automated feature to be precise. We hope this will exit beta and make it to the full version very soon. As always, if you’re stuck at some point, drop a comment down below so that we can take a look and help you out.
