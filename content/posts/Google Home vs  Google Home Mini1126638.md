Google Home Vs Google Home Mini: The Ultimate Showdown for Smart Speaker Supremacy!

In recent years, smart speakers have taken the market by storm, with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home being two of the most popular options. When it comes to Google Home, there are two main models available: the standard Google Home and the compact Google Home Mini. Both devices have their own unique features and strengths, but which one will reign supreme as the ultimate smart speaker?

Design and Size

The first noticeable difference between the two devices is their size. While the original Google Home is a larger device with a cylindrical shape, the Google Home Mini is a more compact and budget-friendly option. The Mini measures just 98mm in diameter and stands at only 42mm tall, making it an ideal choice for those with limited counter or shelf space. The standard Google Home is 142mm in height and 96mm in diameter.

Sound Quality

When it comes to sound quality, both devices have their own unique features. The Google Home Mini is designed to provide 360-degree sound and is equipped with a single 40mm driver. On the other hand, the standard Google Home has a better, fuller sound than the Mini with its dual speakers and subwoofer. The device also has a feature that allows it to adjust its sound quality based on its placement in the room.

Smart Features

Both the Google Home and the Google Home Mini have access to the Google Assistant, a powerful AI assistant that allows you to control your smart home devices, play music, and answer questions using voice commands. However, the only noticeable difference is that the standard Google Home has a built-in Chromecast, allowing you to stream video content onto your TV.

Price

One of the most significant differences between the two devices is their price. The Google Home Mini is priced at $49, making it a budget-friendly option for those who want to test the waters with smart speakers. Meanwhile, the standard Google Home is priced at $99, making it a more expensive option for those who want the full range of features that the Google Assistant has to offer.

Conclusion

Both the Google Home and the Google Home Mini have their own unique capabilities and advantages. But, if you're looking for a smaller device with a budget-friendly option, the Google Home Mini is your best bet. Still, if you're willing to spend more for better sound quality and the ability to stream video content on your TV, the standard Google Home is the way to go. Perfectly, both are great devices for your tabletop needs!

Google Home and Google Home Mini are part of Google's legacy lineup of smart speakers. In 2019, Google replaced the Home models with the Nest Mini. If you still have the older devices or are looking to buy used models, here's a comparison of Google Home and Google Home Mini.

 
##   Overall Findings  
 

The choice between Google Home and Google Home Mini comes down to a few characteristics: sound quality, customization options, and size. Google Assistant is the same on both smart speakers.

 
- Tuned for music.
 - Customization options.
 - 5.6 inches tall.

 
- Tuned for voice.
 - Limited customization options.
 - 1.6 inches tall.

 
##   Sound: Google Home Has an Obvious Edge  
 

The biggest difference between the Google Home and the Google Home Mini is the sound they produce. The Google Home Mini is primarily a voice-enabled assistant for your home; the larger Google Home is designed to add music to the equation. In our opinion, Google Home's better speaker is worth its higher price.

 
- 2-inch driver and dual 2-inch passive radiators.
 - Impressive sound quality for a small device.

 
- Single 1.6-inch speaker.
 - Google Assistant is easy to hear and understand.

 
##   The Controls: Google Home's Fun Controls Win  
 

Google put a fun spin on the smart speaker by including touch controls on the Google Home and the Google Home Mini.

 
- Several touch controls for volume, play/pause, and asking questions.
 - As you adjust the volume, the top of the Home lights up to show the volume level.
 - Touch controls don't work as well as buttons.

 
- Glitch at launch led Google to disable some touch controls.
 - The controls are awkward compared to Google Home's smooth touch controls.
 - The lack of buttons gives Home Mini a sleek look.

 

The controls on top of the Google Home allow you to perform gestures such as moving your finger clockwise to turn the volume up or counterclockwise to turn it down. Tap the top of the speaker to play or pause music, and hold your finger down to ask Google Assistant a question without prefacing it with "Hey Google" or "OK Google." The Google Home touch controls might be gimmicky, but they work well.

 

The Google Home Mini was designed to have a touch control on the top, too, but a glitch that caused the Mini to inadvertently record everything it heard forced Google to disable the functionality. The Google Home Mini still allows you to control the volume by touching the sides of the speaker, and if you hold your finger on the side of the speaker, it acts as a play/pause button.

 
##   Aesthetics: It's a Tie  
 

The obvious difference between the Google Home and the Home Mini is size, but there are a few other differences in appearance.

 
- Customization options to match decor.
 - Metal bases look fantastic.
 - Can change the color of only the base.

 
- Comes in chalk, charcoal, or coral.
 - No customization options after purchase.
 - Smaller size fits in places the Google Home can't.

 

The Google Home stands 5.6 inches tall and comes with a mesh base that is designed to be easily replaced. Google sells a coral fabric base and metal bases in carbon and copper.

 

The smaller Google Home Mini is only 1.6 inches tall, and while slightly wider than the Home, the difference is minimal (3.86 inches versus 3.79 inches).

 

The Google Home has more customization options, but the Home Mini looks cooler.

 
##   Google Assistant: The Same on Both Devices  
 

Google Assistant is exactly the same on both smart speakers. Google Assistant ties into the knowledge graph used by the Google search engine, which makes it the best smart speaker interface this side of IBM Watson for answering questions.

 

Here are a few things you can do with Google Assistant:

 
- Ask questions ranging from "What are the best pizza places in Dallas?" to "Why do cats have fur?"
 - Play Music from Google Play, YouTube Music, Spotify, Pandora, and other streaming music services.
 - Add events to your Google Calendar.
 - Place phone calls.
 - Control your home through compatible smart devices

 
##   Final Verdict  
 

Google Home is the better buy, particularly if you are going to listen to music. If you mainly will be asking Google Assistant questions, controlling your smart home devices, or shopping, the Google Home Mini saves you a little money.
