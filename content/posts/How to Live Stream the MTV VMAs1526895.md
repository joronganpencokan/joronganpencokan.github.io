Live streaming the VMAs requires a stable and fast internet connection. You don't want to miss out on any of the action due to a poor internet connection. Check your internet speed and connectivity before the event begins to avoid any issues.

4. Give Your Device the Boost It Needs

Whether you’re streaming the VMAs on your smartphone, tablet, or laptop, you want to ensure that your device has enough battery and storage to last the full event. Charge your device before the event and clear some space on your device to ensure the best viewing experience.

5. Join the Conversation

Finally, don't forget to join the conversation on social media! Share your thoughts on the performances, fashion, and winners using hashtags like #VMAs, #MTV, and #VMA2021. Be sure to tag your favorite artists and celebrities to join the conversation and show your support.
