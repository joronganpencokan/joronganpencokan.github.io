TITLE: Unlock Insane Speeds! Learn How To Supercharge Your Windows 10 Virtual Memory Today!


Introduction:

Windows 10 is an efficient operating system that has been designed to provide excellent performance on almost any hardware configuration. However, sometimes, it can still become slow and laggy, which can impede productivity significantly. Fortunately, there is a quick and easy fix that can help you speed up your Windows 10 machine without costly upgrades to hardware. Supercharging your Virtual Memory is the answer you have been looking for. In this article, we'll show you how to optimize Windows 10 Virtual Memory so you can unlock insane speeds almost immediately.

Body:

The Virtual Memory is a feature in the Windows operating system that allows your computer to use hard drive space as RAM (Random Access Memory). This feature was designed to allow users to run multiple applications and programs simultaneously, even if the computer's physical RAM is already running at maximum capacity.

However, Virtual Memory has a significant drawback: it can slow down your computer if not optimized correctly. The default settings in Windows 10 are configured to use an automatic paging file size, which means that the operating system manages the Virtual Memory for you. This isn't always the best option because Windows 10 may set the Virtual Memory size too low, which can cause your PC to become slow and unresponsive.

To optimize Windows 10 Virtual Memory, you need to make a few adjustments to the settings. Here's how to do it:

1. Click on the Start Menu and type "Control Panel." Select "System and Security," then "System" from the list of options.
2. Click on "Advanced system settings" on the left-hand side of the window.
3. Click on the "Settings" button under the "Performance" section.
4. Select the "Advanced" tab and click on the "Change" button under the "Virtual Memory" section.
5. Uncheck the box that says "Automatically manage paging file size for all drives."
6. Select the drive where Windows 10 is installed (usually the C drive) and select "Custom Size."
7. In the "Initial size (MB)" box, type in the amount of MB you want to allocate for Virtual Memory. Windows 10 usually recommends roughly 1.5 to 2 times the amount of RAM installed in your machine.
8. In the "Maximum size (MB)" box, type in the amount of MB you would like to be allocated for Virtual Memory. Windows 10 will usually recommend a higher number than the "Initial size" but try to keep it reasonable. Microsoft usually recommends keeping the amount of Virtual Memory allocated to your computer at around 2GB but this will depend on your specific use-case and the amount of RAM you have available.
9. Click on the "Set" button, then click on "OK" to save the changes and close out the window.

Conclusion:

By optimizing your Windows 10 Virtual Memory, you can unlock insane speeds that will make your computer significantly faster and more responsive. The process is relatively easy and requires no additional hardware upgrades. However, it's important to note that improper Virtual Memory settings may result in significant performance issues, so remember to follow the steps above carefully. Try these tips today and experience supercharged Windows 10 performance like never before!

This article explains how to increase virtual memory in Windows 10 by adjusting the page file.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Go to Control Panel > System > Change Settings > Advanced > Settings.Under Virtual memory, select Change, then deselect Automatically manage paging file size for all drives.Select Custom size, then set the Initial size and the Maximum size for your paging file.

 
##   Adjusting the Page File in Windows 10  
 

Are you seeing warning messages like, "Your system is low on virtual memory"?

 

This is because your Windows 10 PC doesn't have enough RAM and is trying to write to virtual memory, but the page file that serves as virtual memory has a file size limit that's too low.

 

If you don't want to see these error messages, you need to increase virtual memory on Windows 10.

 
- Open the Control Panel and select System.
 - While you're in the System window, make a note of the size of your currently available RAM. You will need this later. In the example shown here, there is 8 GB of available RAM.
 - In the System window, select Change Settings.
 - In the System Properties window, select the Advanced tab. In the Performance section, select the Settings button to open the Performance Options window.
 - Under Virtual memory, select the Change button to modify the virtual memory settings.
 - In the Virtual Memory window, deselect Automatically manage paging file size for all drives. Select Custom size. Now you can set the Initial size and the Maximum size for your paging file.
 - As a rule of thumb, the paging file should be a minimum of 1.5 times the size of your installed RAM, and a maximum of 3 times your RAM size. For example, if you have 8 GB RAM, your minumum would be 1024 x 8 x 1.5 = 12,288 MB, and your maximum would be 1024 x 8 x 3 = 24,576 MB.

 

Keep in mind that if you set your paging file size at the upper limit, you could experience significant system slowdown, since data reads and writes to the hard drive where the paging file is stored are much slower than normal RAM. The minimum recommened size is usually enough of an increase to meet your needs. This is often double the amount that the system automatically sets.

 

Open the Control Panel and select System.

 
While you're in the System window, make a note of the size of your currently available RAM. You will need this later. In the example shown here, there is 8 GB of available RAM.
 

In the System window, select Change Settings.

 

In the System Properties window, select the Advanced tab. In the Performance section, select the Settings button to open the Performance Options window.

 

Under Virtual memory, select the Change button to modify the virtual memory settings.

 

In the Virtual Memory window, deselect Automatically manage paging file size for all drives. Select Custom size. Now you can set the Initial size and the Maximum size for your paging file.

 
As a rule of thumb, the paging file should be a minimum of 1.5 times the size of your installed RAM, and a maximum of 3 times your RAM size. For example, if you have 8 GB RAM, your minumum would be 1024 x 8 x 1.5 = 12,288 MB, and your maximum would be 1024 x 8 x 3 = 24,576 MB.
 
##   Should You Change Virtual Memory in Windows 10?  
 

Increasing the virtual memory in Windows 10 should only be used as a temporary fix to remove the errors. However, since performance when the system uses the paging file is always slower than when it uses RAM, it's not a good idea to keep your system running under these conditions.

 

You can use the increased virtual memory solution so that you can continue using your computer until you have time to purchase additional RAM memory cards and upgrade your system. You shouldn't use this as a permanent solution.

 
##   What Is Virtual Memory in Windows 10?  
 

Two terms you may hear used interchangeably are "virtual memory" and "paging file."

 

Both of these refer to a file on your hard drive where Windows temporarily moves information that it would normally store in RAM. Whenever you no longer have enough RAM memory available, Windows uses this paging file instead.

 

The configured size and capacity of this file is referred to as virtual memory. While it isn't an actual hardware memory card like RAM, it serves the same purpose.

 

There are a lot of reasons why your Windows 10 PC might slow down. One of the most common is a combination of two things: not having enough RAM and not having enough virtual memory. This combination can lead to poor performance and error messages. The easiest way to fix both of these issues is to increase virtual memory in Windows 10.

 
The biggest difference between RAM and virtual memory is that the paging file used for virtual memory is stored on your hard drive. Reading and writing to the hard drive is much slower than reading and writing to RAM memory cards. So while using virtual memory allows you to do more than you could without it, you'll still notice a performance slowdown if your computer has to use virtual memory a lot.
