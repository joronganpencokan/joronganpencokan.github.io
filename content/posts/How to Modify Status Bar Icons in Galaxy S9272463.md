Open the app and tap on Quick Star on the main screen. This will take you to another screen where you can download the selected addon. Tap on the Install button and wait for it to install. It will be enabled automatically after installation.
 
Get back to the main screen and tap on Quick Star again. This time, you will get into the addon’s tweak screen. Tap on Simple Indicator and enable it by switching the toggle. Now, you can simply use the toggles next to each entry to either enable or disable them. Find the entries you do not want to see and disable it to remove their corresponding icons form the status bar.
 
Quick Star does more than just clearing up the status bar. You can heavily modify the notifications and Quick Settings panel. Play around with it.
