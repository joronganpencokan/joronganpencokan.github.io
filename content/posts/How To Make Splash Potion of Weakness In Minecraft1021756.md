Unleash the Power of Splash Potions in Minecraft with This One Shocking Trick!

Minecraft has become one of the world's most popular games, and it's no wonder why. With its expansive world, endless possibilities and numerous challenges, the game has captured the imagination of millions of gamers worldwide. And one of the most exciting features of the game is the use of splash potions.

If you're a Minecraft player, you know that splash potions are incredibly powerful items. With just one throw, they can provide you with a range of benefits, including healing, speeding up or slowing down mobs, and creating temporary invisibility. But what you might not know is that there's one shocking trick that can make your splash potions even more powerful.

The trick is to use redstone. Yes, that simple little red dust that can be found in caves and other underground spaces can elevate your splash potions to the next level.

Here's how it works: normally, when you throw a splash potion, it will have an immediate effect on any creature or player within its radius. However, if you add redstone to the mix, the potion will become a potion of extended effect. This means that the potion will affect any creature or player within its radius for a longer period of time than if it was just a regular splash potion.

To use redstone to create a potion of extended effect, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Craft a splash potion of your choice using a brewing stand.

2. Craft a redstone dust block by combining nine pieces of redstone in a crafting table.

3. Place the redstone dust block into the top slot of the brewing stand and the splash potion into the bottom slot.

4. Wait for the potion to brew. Once it's ready, you can throw it like any other splash potion.

5. Enjoy the extended effects of your potion!

By following these simple steps, you can turn an ordinary splash potion into a potent potion of extended effect, making it even more useful and powerful. So the next time you're playing Minecraft and need to use a splash potion, remember to use redstone and unleash its true potential.

Minecraft is an amazing Sandbox game that brings the 2D Pixels aesthetic to a 3D game. You can play in Singleplayer and create magnificent builds like Monuments, various Realms, Redstone Machines, etc. Aside from building, Minecraft also has a PvP aspect to it. As such, Players will try to find ways to have an edge over their opponents. One way of doing that is by crafting Potions like the Splash Potion of Weakness. In this guide, I will show you how to make a Splash Potion of Weakness in Minecraft.
 
## How to Make a Splash Potion of Weakness in Minecraft
 

 
The Potions in Minecraft allow the player to apply a Status Effect on either themselves or on others. These Effects can be good or bad. Splash Potion of Weakness in Minecraft deals with the Weakness Effect. This Status Effect decreases the amount of Melee Damage the victim can do to their Targets. To make a Splash Potion of Weakness, you will need:
 
- Brewing Stand
 - Blaze Powder
 - Sugarcane
 - Spider Eye
 - Brown Mushroom
 - Gunpowder
 - 3 Bottle of Water

 
 
 
Covert Blaze Rods into Blaze Powder, Sugarcane to Sugar, & the Spider Eye into Fermented Spider Eye by combining it with the Sugar & Brown Mushroom. Now access the Brewing Stand & put the 3 Bottles of Water in it and the Blaze Powder as the Fuel source. At the top, place the Fermented Spider Eye and let it brew into the Bottles of Water. This will give you 3 Potions of Weakness. Now at the top, place the Gunpowder and let it brew with the Potions of Weakness. This will give you 3 Splash Potions of Weakness. That’s how you can get this Splash Potion.
 
## What Does the Splash Potion Do?
 
As I have mentioned above, The Splash Potion of Weakness applies the Weakness Status Effect in an AOE area. Players & Mobs affected by it will do less Melee Damage. But there is another use for it. If you can find a Zombie Villager, you will be able to convert it back to a Villager. You will need to have the Splash Potion of Weakness & a Golden Apple. Throw the Potion onto the Zombie Villager and feed it the Golden Apple. After a few minutes, it will convert back into a Villager. But the benefit of doing this is that this Villager will give you Trades at very good discounted rates. This is perfect for a Villager Trading Hall as you can convert the Villagers to Zombie Villagers & back to get better Trades.
