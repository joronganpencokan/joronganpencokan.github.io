You will have to use a YouTube Marketing Service that increases your video content reach. It’s a legit method used by many new and growing channels. Via YT Marketing Service you can via ads market your video to a broader audience. It in return will get you more views and subscribers.

Upon your entry into this program, you will be able to benefit from the ability to earn revenue from your channel. You can do so in the following ways:
 
1. Use Ads to Enable YouTube Monetization
 
Picture this. You click on the video of one of your favorite YouTubers. What happens next? You find yourself looking at a 10-second advertisement. You look to your right, and you find another ad banner next to the video too. How did these advertisements get here? Why are they even a part of the video you originally wanted to watch? Well, that is what YouTube ads are all about. Playing an advertisement before your video, or placing an ad banner on the same page as your video can help you earn revenue. You also have the freedom and ability to place advertisements according to your preference. The platform allows you to choose from a bevy of different ad formats.
 
YouTube offers you the ability to either monetize multiple videos or individual videos. Before enabling advertisements on your videos, you need to make sure the content in the said videos meets advertiser-friendly content guidelines set by YouTube.
 
2. Affiliate Marketing
 
When making YouTube videos, you may notice the use of certain products. These could range from camera gear and equipment to even personal care products or clothing (depending on the content you create). You’ll be surprised to know you can actually earn quite a decent revenue by helping sell these products through affiliate marketing.
 
In order to enable affiliate marketing, you need to sign up for an affiliating marketing program with a website or an e-vendor. There are plenty of websites that allow you to sign up for affiliate marketing programs. While the amount of money you earn from this medium may vary across websites, you can still manage to earn a decent amount, depending on the quality of your content.
 
3. Merchandise
 
Feel like your YouTube channel has been growing steadily for quite some time with a decent fanbase too? Well, then it’s time to explore the wonderful world of merchandising. Merchandising is a great way of monetizing your YouTube channel. There is absolutely no limit on the types of merchandise you can create. As long as you put effort into the design and have a good base of subscribers and viewers, you should be able to make a decent amount of money.
 
4. Paid Sponsorships
 
Imagine getting the chance to collaborate with your favorite mobile brand for no cost while also being paid! Well, that is just an example of what paid sponsorships can be in YouTube. These types of deals offer you the ability to make money while also getting the opportunity to endorse and use a certain product or service.
 
Such partnerships are usually a win-win affair, with both, the brand as well as the content creator benefitting monetarily.
 
5. Memberships
 
Additionally, you can also use channel memberships as an opportunity to offer discounts on merchandise and interaction opportunities.
 
6. Making use of Super Features
 
If you are the kind of YouTuber that spends a good chunk of time live-streaming content, you can take a look at Super Features. With the help of elements like Super Chat and Super Stickers, supporters of your channel can show their appreciation for your content monetarily. The world of Super Chats, Stickers, and Thanks is quite vast, so we recommend you explore it for yourself.
 
7. YouTube Premium for Channel Monetization
 
While not necessarily the most popular way of monetizing your content, YouTube Premium offers viewers the ability to view videos without ads. Additionally, you can also download videos and play them without keeping the app open. YouTube pays channel owners who create content for Premium in the same manner as they do for ad revenue.
 
8. BrandConnect by YouTube
 
BrandConnect is an initiative by YouTube to help connect content creators with different brands. With the help of this venture, you can collaborate with brands for campaigns. However, this feature is only available in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada at the time of writing this guide.
