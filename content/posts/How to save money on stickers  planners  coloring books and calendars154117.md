# Unlock the Secret to Massive Savings on Fun Stationery Essentials!

Are you a stationery lover? Do you collect pens, sticky notes, notebooks, and all sorts of office supplies for fun or for work? If so, you know that stationery shopping can quickly add up, leaving a dent in your budget. But fear not, because there is a secret to unlocking massive savings on your favorite stationery essentials!

First of all, consider buying in bulk. Many stationery brands offer discounts when you buy a set of items instead of just one. For example, you can buy a pack of 12 pens for a lower price per pen than if you bought them individually. This is a great way to save money on items that you know you will use frequently, such as pens or sticky notes.

Another way to save is to sign up for loyalty programs or newsletters from your favorite stationery stores. Some shops will offer exclusive discounts or coupons to their subscribers, which can add up to significant savings over time. Plus, you may be the first to know about new product releases and sales.

If you don't mind buying slightly used items, you can also check out online marketplaces such as eBay, Mercari, or Amazon Renewed. Many people sell lightly used stationery items that are still in good condition for a fraction of the original price. This is a great option if you want to save money and still enjoy fun and unique stationery items.

Finally, if you're open to trying new stationery brands, consider shopping at discount stores or dollar stores. These shops often carry lesser-known brands at lower prices, allowing you to experiment with different items without breaking the bank. You may even find some hidden gems that become your new favorite stationery essentials!

In conclusion, there are many ways to unlock massive savings on fun stationery essentials. By buying in bulk, signing up for loyalty programs or newsletters, shopping at online marketplaces, or checking out discount stores, you can save money while still indulging in your love for all things stationery. Try out these tips and see how much you can save on your next stationery haul!

Preparation is essential when printing important paperwork, whether it’s for work or a private project. That’s because printer mistakes are expensive. If you randomly print something you need without preparing ahead of time, that’s a waste of ink, time and cash.
That’s why we here at the Komando HQ like to leave our printing templates to the pros. Instead of trying to create our own calendars, spreadsheets and business cards by hand, we like to use some of these free resources to start on the right foot. Here are our favorite templates that you’ll use time and time again, brought to you by our sponsor Epson.

## 5. Use this comprehensive spring cleaning checklist for a squeaky clean home


Get your rooms all spic and span with this detailed cleaning list. It covers everything, from your kitchen and bathrooms to the porches and entryway. If you tend to get distracted when deep cleaning, this well-organized paper will keep you accountable.

## 6. Kids color for free, thanks to Crayola

Whether your kids want to color Disney characters or their favorite animals, this free collection has many coloring pages. Crayola’s coloring collection even has resources for adults who wish to wind down and enjoy some art. 

 
## BONUS: Make your own door hanger


Maybe the locks in your house aren’t working. You try to put socks on the door when you’re sleeping, but they fall off, and people barge in your room anyway. Maybe you want to start your own hotel or even turn your extra room into an Airbnb rental.
Door hangers are a helpful way to send a wordless message. With a simple placement of this hanger over your doorknob, you can let people know to stay out … or if it’s okay to stay in. Your kids might like it, too — and it’s a lot more pleasing to the eye than bold caution tape or a warning sign saying to stay out!
Luckily, Uprinting has what you need. You can download them for Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Acrobat. Or you can find a JPEG template or one that works with Microsoft Publisher.

 
## Now that you know what to print, here’s how to actually, you know, print


We mentioned earlier that printing mistakes can be costly. That’s because traditional ink cartridges cost an arm and a leg. Eventually, Kim got tired of paying way too much for her ink refills.
After looking for a better solution, she discovered the Epson EcoTank, which puts a whole new spin on printing. Instead of relying on clunky cartridges that run out way too quickly, these printers use large jugs of refillable ink. Using this printer can save you a ridiculous amount of money over time.
Epson EcoTank printers come with a ridiculous amount of ink right in the box. You get enough ink to print a whopping 6,000 color pages. So if you want to upgrade your printer, give the Epson EcoTank a go!
Check out Epson EcoTank printers at a Best Buy, OfficeMax or Office Depot near you, or shop online at Epson.com/EcoTankKim.
