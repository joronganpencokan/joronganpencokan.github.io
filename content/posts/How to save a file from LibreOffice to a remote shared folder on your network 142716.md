# Revolutionize Your File Saving System: Discover the Secret to Saving Libreoffice Documents to a Shared Network Folder Effortlessly!

Are you tired of saving your Libreoffice documents one by one to different folders? Do you find it tedious to share your documents with your team or colleagues? Worry no more! In this article, we will tackle a game-changing solution to revolutionize your file saving system.

## The Problem

In most offices or workplaces, sharing files and documents is an everyday task. However, saving them to different folders and directories could be time-consuming and counterproductive, especially if there are multiple files to save. This task could lead to confusion and disorganization, which can negatively affect productivity and workflow.

## The Solution

The secret to saving Libreoffice documents to a shared network folder effortlessly is the use of the "Master Document" feature. This feature allows users to merge multiple documents into one, making it easier to save and share them in one location.

To do this, open Libreoffice and create a new document. Click on "File" then "Master Document." In the "Navigator" window, click on the arrow beside "New" and select "Insert." Choose the document you want to add to the master document, and repeat the process for the other documents.

Once you have added all the documents you need, you can adjust the order by dragging and dropping them in the "Navigator" window. Click on "File" then "Save As" and choose the folder where you want to save the master document.

By saving the master document to a shared network folder, you can easily access and share it with your team or colleagues. And if you need to edit a specific document in the master document, simply double-click on it in the "Navigator" window and make your changes.

## Benefits

Using the "Master Document" feature in Libreoffice offers several benefits, including:

- Organized File Management: This feature allows users to group multiple files into one master document, making it easier to save and share them in one location.

- Time-Saving: Since files are saved in one folder, you can save time and effort by not repeating the process of saving files repeatedly.

- Enhanced Collaboration: Sharing files and documents becomes more comfortable since you only need to share one file – the master document.

- Improved Productivity: By reducing the time spent on file management, you can focus on the essential tasks and improve your productivity.

## Conclusion

Revolutionize your file saving system by using the "Master Document" feature in Libreoffice. This feature offers a convenient and efficient way of saving and sharing multiple documents in one location. By following the simple steps outlined in this article, you can save time, increase productivity, and enhance collaboration in your workplace.

To that end, both services have made it incredibly easy to work with others.
However, there may be times when you don't want to use third-party services for collaboration. You might have highly sensitive data in files that you can't or don't want to trust to a third party. For those instances, you might want to keep that data housed within your network and on your desktops or servers. 
This might lead you to create shared folders that can be accessed from various machines on your network.

One lesser-known feature found in LibreOffice is the Remote Save feature. With this option, you can save a file to a remote service (such as an SSH server or a Windows Share). There are other options (such as Google Drive) but some of them have been broken for a very long time and show no signs of being fixed. However, the Windows Share feature works very well.
Let me show you how to use it.

And that's all there is to configuring LibreOffice to save files to a remote Windows share. If you only have that one remote service configured, every time you go to do a Remote Save, you'll automatically be prompted to enter your credentials for the remote share, and the save will work seamlessly. 

 
Host: The IP address of your Windows Share on the remote machine.Share: The name of the share on the remote machine.User: Your valid username on the Windows Share host.Password: The password for your user on the remote machine.Label: A human-readable name for the share.Root: Leave blank.


After configuring the share, click OK and you're ready.

One thing to keep in mind is that you can configure multiple remote save services. If you do that, when you go to save remotely, you'll be prompted to select the service you want to use. Other than that, this feature should be as simple as saving a file to your local drive.
