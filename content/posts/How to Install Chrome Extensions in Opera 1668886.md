Do you often feel like Opera browser lacks the extension support that Chrome or Firefox offer? Have you been missing out on using your favorite Chrome extensions in Opera? Well, fret not, because we have found a secret hack which will enable you to use Chrome extensions in Opera. 

Opera is a fast and sleek web browser, but it falls a bit short when it comes to the variety of extensions it supports. Meanwhile, Google Chrome has a vast library of extensions that suited users' every need. Unfortunately, these extensions are exclusive to Chrome and cannot be found on any other browser, including Opera. 

But, what if we told you that you could use your favorite Chrome extension in Opera? You'd be surprised to know that you can use many Chrome extensions in Opera by simply installing an extension. All of this is made possible thanks to a hidden Chrome extension called "Install Chrome Extensions." 

So, here's how you can install Chrome extensions in Opera using this nifty little trick. 

## Step 1: Add the "Install Chrome Extensions" extension to Opera

The first thing you need to do is install the "Install Chrome Extensions" extension on your Opera browser. This extension is available for free from the Opera add-ons store, and you can download it by simply visiting the Opera add-ons store and searching for it. Once you find the extension, click on the "add to Opera" button to install it.

To do this, go to Settings > Advanced > Privacy and Security > Site settings > Extensions in your Opera browser. Look for the "Allow extensions from other stores" option and turn it on. 

## Step 4: Install the Chrome extension in Opera

Now that you have enabled the "Allow extensions from other stores" option, you can install the Chrome extension you want to use in Opera. Simply look for the extension you want to install on the Chrome Web Store, click on the "Add to Opera" button, and the extension will be added to your Opera browser.
