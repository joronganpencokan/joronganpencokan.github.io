# Revolutionary Hack To Keep Your Memorable Text Messages FOREVER While Clearing Up Phone Clutter!

As smartphones have become an inseparable part of our daily lives, we tend to use them for everything- from making calls to taking pictures, storing personal documents, and even texting our loved ones! However, as convenient as it may be, the accumulation of unnecessary texts, pictures, and files can quickly clutter up our phones, creating storage issues and causing us to lose track of the messages that hold sentimental value.

If you're someone who loves holding on to messages that have touched your heart, made you laugh out loud, or simply made your day, you'd know how frustrating it can be to have to delete them to make room for other files. Fortunately, there's a revolutionary hack that can help you keep all your memorable texts without sacrificing storage space on your phone- iCloud!

iCloud is Apple's cloud-based storage service that is designed to help users seamlessly store and access files, pictures, and messages across all Apple devices. Not only is it an efficient way to store your important data, but it also allows you to free up space on your phone while keeping your messages safe and secure.

So, if you're wondering how to use iCloud to keep your memorable text messages forever, here's what you need to do:

## Step 1: Enable iCloud Messages

The first step to using iCloud to store your messages is to enable iCloud Messages on your iPhone. This feature allows you to store all your iMessages and SMS messages in the cloud, ensuring that they are safe and accessible from anywhere. To enable this feature:

- Go to Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud
- Activate the toggle switch next to Messages

Now, all your messages will automatically be stored in iCloud, enabling you to access them from any device logged in to your Apple ID.

## Step 2: Delete Messages from Your Phone

Once you've enabled iCloud Messages, you can start deleting messages from your phone to clear up space. However, instead of deleting them permanently, you can choose to keep them in iCloud by selecting the "Keep Messages" option. To do this:

- Go to Settings > Messages
- Scroll down to "Message History"
- Select "Keep Messages"
- Choose "Forever" from the options provided

By choosing to keep the messages "forever" in iCloud, you can still access them whenever you want, without having to worry about losing them when you delete them from your phone.

## Step 3: Access Your Messages on Any Device

Now that your messages are stored in iCloud, you can access them on any device that's logged in with your Apple ID. Whether you want to view your messages on your iPhone, iPad, or even your MacBook, you can do so seamlessly. All you need to do is:

- Go to Messages on your device
- Sign in with your Apple ID
- Your messages should automatically sync with iCloud, allowing you to access them across all devices

## Final Thoughts

Using iCloud to store your messages is an excellent way to keep your memorable texts and clear up space on your phone. It's easy to use, and once you've set it up, you won't have to worry about losing your messages ever again. By following these simple steps, you can ensure that your messages are safe, secure, and accessible from any device. So, the next time you're looking for a way to hold on to your sentimental texts, remember this revolutionary hack, and never lose them again!

Yet, there is one puzzling fact about text messages that most people can’t figure out: how to save them. If you needed to save your texts, say for a court case, or hold onto cherished memories, would you know how to do it?
Probably not. But, don’t worry. These simple tips walk you through the process of saving text messages for both Android and Apple gadgets.

 
## Saving Android texts


With all the advances in technology, you’d think that saving a text message would be a simple, one-tap step on your phone. As people say, there’s an app for just about everything.
Fortunately there are some apps out there that make saving texts easy. One free app for Android devices that we like is SMS Backup & Restore. 
Once SMS Backup & Restore is installed, you can save text messages (and emails and other messages). You can select which texts to save or set it up to automatically backup your texts at specific times.
There’s also a search feature so you can easily find your saved texts. Plus, you can save your texts to the cloud so you can access them from any internet-connected device.
Here are some feature that you can expect with the app:

 
Backup SMS (text) messages, MMS and call logs in XML format.Choose a recurring scheduled time to automatically back up.Search backups.Restore/transfer backup to another phone. The format is independent of the Android version, so messages and logs can be easily transferred from one phone to another.Free up space on your phone. Delete all SMS messages or call logs on the Phone.Email a backup file.


The app is free from the Google Play Store but does contain ads.

## Saving texts in iOS


When it comes to Apple devices, it won’t be as easy on your pocketbook. The good news is when you do regular backups of your iPhone, a backup of text messages is created. So, if you get a new phone, all of your messages will transfer over. The downside is that you can’t export or see all of your messages on your computer.
To do that, you’ll need a program on your computer like iExplorer. It will set you back $40 for a single license, but if you buy the family pack of five licenses, you’ll get a deal for $70. 
With this program, you can export text messages, voice mails and contacts from your phone’s address book straight to your computer. You’ve also got the option to drag and drop voice memos onto iTunes or another app on your computer.
While it’s easy to bemoan the relative difficulty of saving a text message, you must do it. Just think about this. Have you ever had one of those days where you’re just tired of scrolling through tons of texts? So, you start deleting them.
Or maybe your phone is slowing down, or you’re getting alerts telling you that you’re running out of storage. Delete, delete, delete.
Taking all that off your iPhone may give you a momentary sense of satisfaction. But in no time, you remember the important messages you had in there: photos, texts that included friends’ addresses and phone numbers.
To avoid this, backup your texts to Apple’s iTunes. It takes a little work. But doing this regularly will ensure that you have all your important messages in one location that you can retrieve from any internet-connected device.
