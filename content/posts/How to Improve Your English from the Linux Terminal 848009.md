When it comes to learning English, every little bit helps. While you may have already tried listening to podcasts, reading English books or watching movies with subtitles, have you considered the use of Linux Terminal hacks?

Yes, you read that right! Using the command line interface of the Linux operating system can offer you an innovative and exciting way to learn English. The following hacks offer unique and fun methods of using your Linux Terminal to improve your English skills.

1. Set your computer's language to English
By setting your computer's language to English, you'll need to read and comprehend English every time you use your computer. This is an effective way to integrate English learning into your everyday activities, and also helps to immerse yourself in the English language.

2. Use a command line dictionary
Install a command-line dictionary like Goldendict or dictd and use it while you're using the terminal. This way, you can pick up new words while you learn new commands. Understanding the definitions and usage of new words offers immediate benefits as it improves your vocabulary.

3. Watch subtitled movies or series
You can use the terminal to download movies, series and documentaries in English. By using terminal tools like youtube-dl or p7zip, you will be accessing videos in high quality and subtitles. This will help you with listening comprehension and will also serve as a great way to learn new words, expressions and idioms by watching movies in their original language.

4. Do grammar exercises
Linux terminal offers a vast number of tools that you can use for grammar exercises. Command-line programs like 'Grammalecte' or 'LanguageTool' can help you analyze and correct the grammar of your writing. This will allow you to learn from your mistakes and progress as an English speaker.

5. Write assignments with Linux Terminal
Writing assignments using the terminal can be a very helpful exercise. Try using vim or nano, two text editors installed in most Linux distros, to write short essays or stories. It sharpens your writing skills and allows you to apply what you've learned in a practical way. To go further, you can use online proofreading tools such as 'Hemingway Editor' or 'Grammarly' to correct and improve your writing style.

In conclusion, English learning doesn't always have to be a mundane and repetitive process.

While English may not be the most spoken language in the world, it’s definitely one of the most important ones, especially in the world o business. It is often the language of choice between two parties when both speak and understand only their native languages. Good English skills open new avenues for those aspiring to study abroad or get involved in research activities.
 
There are many ways you can learn English, but the geekiest way has to be from the Linux terminal. If your job involves working on computers (specifically, the Linux command line), and you don’t have much time to devote to any other activity, here’s a nice little way to improve your English. In this article we will discuss how you can do that.
 
Note: all commands and instructions mentioned in this article have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04.
 
## Sudocabulary
 
Sudocabulary is the tool that we will be discussing in this article. It’s basically a script that when executed makes every terminal window that you launch thereafter greet you with a new English word along with its meaning. Basically, you get to learn (or relearn) a new English language word each time you open a command line terminal.
 
Sudocabulary is developed by a guy named B Adarsh, and its GitHub page reveals that the developer is advertising the tool as “a smart way to memorize flash card words for exams like GRE.” Moving forward, there are even plans to add mnemonics for each word to more easily remember.
 
## Installation and Usage
 
Installing Sudocabulary is a fairly easy process. All you have to do is execute the following command:
 
If the above command is successful (which it most likely should), the tool will be active. You can test it by opening a new terminal window or tab. For example, the following is how the terminal window looked in my case.
 

 
Here are a couple more examples.
 
To remove the tool, just open the “.bashrc” file in your Home folder and delete all references to “.vocab” as well as remove the “.vocab” file from your home directory.
 
## Conclusion
 
Sudocabulary may represent a very simple idea, but it could be of great help to those who have a very busy daily schedule – learning one word at a time is neither difficult nor time-consuming. Of course, there is a vast scope for improvement – for example, the output could also have a sentence or two explaining how the word can be used – but it’s an effective first step, I’d say.
