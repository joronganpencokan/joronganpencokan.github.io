Are you constantly typing the same phrases or commands over and over again on your Ubuntu Natty system? Do you often wish that there was a way to automate these repetitive tasks and save yourself some time and effort? If so, then you're in luck because Autokey is here to help!

Autokey is a powerful text expansion and automation tool that can help you supercharge your Ubuntu Natty workflow with just a few clicks. In this article, we'll show you how to get started with Autokey and give you some quick tips to help you automate your most frequent tasks.

Step 1: Install Autokey

The first step to supercharging your Ubuntu Natty workflow with Autokey is to install it on your system. You can easily do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```sudo apt-get install autokey-gtk```

Step 2: Create A New Phrase

Once you have Autokey installed, it's time to create your first phrase. A phrase is essentially a block of text or a command that you want to automate. To create a new phrase, simply click on the Autokey icon in your system tray and select "New Phrase."

From here, you can enter the text or command that you want to automate, specify a shortcut key or hotkey to trigger the automation, and save your new phrase.

Step 3: Test Your Phrase

Now that you've created your first phrase, it's time to test it out. Simply type the shortcut key or hotkey that you specified in step 2 and watch as Autokey automates the text or command that you entered.

If everything works as expected, congratulations! You've just automated one of your most frequent tasks in Ubuntu Natty.

Step 4: Explore Advanced Features

Autokey isn't just limited to simple text expansion and automation tasks. It also offers a range of advanced features, including:

- Regular expressions: Use regular expressions to match and manipulate text in more complex ways.
- Scripts: Write custom Python scripts to perform complex automation tasks that aren't possible with simple text expansion.
- Conditional statements: Use conditional statements to control when your phrases are triggered based on specific conditions.

These advanced features can take your Autokey automation to the next level and help you save even more time and effort in your daily workflow.

Conclusion

Autokey is a powerful tool that can help you automate your most frequent tasks and supercharge your Ubuntu Natty workflow. With just a few clicks, you can create custom phrases and hotkeys to automate repetitive tasks, and explore advanced features like regular expressions and custom scripts to take your automation to the next level.

Autokey is my favorite keyboard shortcut manager in Ubuntu. It is a desktop automation utility for Linux and X11 and it allows you to create scripts and assign hotkeys to these scripts, allowing you to execute them on demand in whatever program you are using.
 
Now, if you have upgraded your Ubuntu to the latest version – 11.04 Natty, you will find that Autokey no longer works. There is either no icon at the system tray or that you can’t create your own shortcut key. In fact, if you check out the Autokey PPA, you will also find that there is no package for Natty. Luckily, there is a simple way to make it work in Ubuntu Natty.

1. In Ubuntu Natty, assuming you are using the Ubuntu Classic (without Unity) desktop, first add the “maverick” version of the autokey PPA.
 
2. Add the following lines to the end of the file.
 
3. Save and close the file. Next, in the terminal, 
 
4. Run Autokey (Applications -> Accessories -> Autokey (GTK)). You should see the Autokey applet in your system tray. Click on it to load the configuration window. 
 
Go to “Edit -> Preferences” and click the “Interface” tab. Select the first choice “X Record – for X.org server v1.5 or v1.7.6 and above”. 
 
5. Restart your computer. It should work correctly the next time you login. 
 

 
## Make Autokey works in Ubuntu Unity
 
If you are using the Unity desktop, Autokey will work but the icon won’t appear in the system tray. 
 
Here’s what you need to do:
 
Open a terminal and type:
 
That’s it. The icon should appear. You can then follow the above steps to change the interface to “X Record – for X.org server v1.5 or v1.7.6 and above“. Restart the computer and it should work.
