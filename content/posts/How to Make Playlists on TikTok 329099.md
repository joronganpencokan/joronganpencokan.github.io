# Secret Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Creating Killer Playlists on Tiktok!

Tiktok has taken the social media world by storm, and it's not showing any signs of slowing down. This video-sharing app has left many of us watching hypnotizing short videos, with catchy tunes and impressive editing, made by creative minds worldwide. As Tiktokers frequently use well-crafted playlists as the foundation of their content, a killer playlist is essential for driving engagement and producing quality content. In this article, we'll reveal the ultimate guide to creating killer playlists on Tiktok!

## Step 1: Choose Your Brand

Before creating a playlist, it's essential to choose your brand or niche on Tiktok. Whether you're making tutorials, comedy sketches, or lifestyle videos, your unique style will shine through. Once you have a clear identity, you can appropriately determine the type of music that fits your brand.

## Step 2: Analyze The Tiktok Sounds

Tiktok is heavily driven by music, with users frequently creating and uploading their soundbites. Therefore, analyzing the most popular sounds on Tiktok is a great starting point. To do so, go to the 'Discover' tab, tap sounds, and sort by the most popular. Analyzing the most popular sounds can guide your selection of trending music that will attract more views and followers.

## Step 3: Incorporate Your Favorite Music

Don't be afraid to add your favorite tracks to the playlist! Adding personal choices can help showcase your musical taste and create a unique soundtrack for your content. For instance, adding current songs, throwback music, and underestimated classics can help you stand out from the rigid norm.

## Step 4: Keep it Consistent

Try to keep the playlists consistent with your brand by sticking to specific genres or themes that align with your content. A consistent theme of music can help viewers identify your videos and create a strong brand identity that resonates with your content. Consistency also ensures that your followers will know what to expect from your brand's audio choices, which strengthens engagement.

## Step 5: Non-Linear Playlists

Finally, consider creating non-linear playlists that work at any part of your content. This technique enables you to mix different genres, familiarity levels, and moods of the song. Incorporating non-linear playlists will ensure that you never run out of options for the right tune to match the video's moment. 

In conclusion, having a killer playlist is as important as having the perfect content for a Tiktok video. By choosing your brand, analyzing Tiktok sounds, incorporating your favorites, keeping it consistent, and creating non-linear playlists, you are taking the first steps to creating killer playlists on Tiktok. By following these pro-tips and having fun with it, you can excel and become a Tiktok legendary in no time!

People are always on the lookout for something never seen before.
