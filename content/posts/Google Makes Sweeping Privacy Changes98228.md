# You Won't Believe What Google Is Doing to Your Personal Data!

It's no secret that Google is one of the most powerful companies on the planet. With popular services like Gmail, Google Drive, and YouTube, the company has access to a staggering amount of personal data. However, what most people don't know is just how much of this data Google is collecting, and what they're doing with it.

## The Data Collection Machine

To understand what Google is doing with your personal data, you first need to know how they're getting it. Every time you use a Google service, the company is tracking what you do, what you search for, and what you click on. They're also collecting information about your location, your device, and even your voice.

This data is then used to build a profile of you, which Google uses to personalize your experience and show you targeted ads. It's this personalized advertising that makes Google so valuable to advertisers and has helped the company become one of the most successful businesses in history.

## The Dark Side of Data Collection

While personalized advertising might seem harmless, the truth is that Google's data collection has some very real and sinister implications. For starters, Google's tracking makes it incredibly difficult to remain anonymous online. It's almost impossible to use Google services without leaving a digital trail behind you.

What's more, Google's data collection practices have come under fire for their invasion of privacy. In 2018, the company was fined $5 billion by the European Union for antitrust violations and for using its dominant position to collect data on users without their consent.

## So What Can You Do?

If you're concerned about what Google is doing with your personal data, there are a few things you can do. First, you can limit the amount of data Google collects on you by using its privacy settings. For example, you can disable location tracking or limit the data Google collects from your searches.

You should also consider using alternative services that don't track your data as much. For example, you might use DuckDuckGo instead of Google Search or ProtonMail instead of Gmail.

At the end of the day, it's up to you to decide how much of your personal data you're willing to share with Google. While there's no denying the convenience of their services, it's important to remember that every search or click you make is being recorded and used to build a profile of you. The choice is yours.

Google just updated its privacy tools across a variety of services including Search, YouTube, and Maps. It's a smart move, especially in the wake of Apple's own re-commitment to privacy and a world where data security is a major topic across the globe.

 
All the Google services you use are changing the way they protect your privacy; knowing what and how they're changing will help you keep your personal information secure.
 

Auto-delete default: Google can already automatically delete your Location, Search, Voice, and YouTube activity data in three or 18-month intervals, but you had to opt-in. Now auto-delete is the default for all core Google activity settings. YouTube will be set to 36 months by default.

 

If you want to keep your history intact, you'll need to do that manually.

 

Easier access: Now you can get to the privacy checkup settings with a simple 'Google Privacy Checkup' in Search.

 

While you're there, Google will offer "proactive recommendations, including guided tips to help you manage your privacy settings."

 

Better yet, Google Incognito mode can now be enabled with a long press on your profile picture in Search, Maps, and YouTube on iOS (with Android coming soon).

 

Check your password: Google's Password Checkup tool, to check if any passwords you save to your Google Account have been compromised, will soon be integrated directly into your Google Account and Chrome. You'll no longer need to install an extension for this important service.

 

Bottom line: Your data is important, and should be kept secure. These tools are just another way to help make that happen, but you have to use them.
