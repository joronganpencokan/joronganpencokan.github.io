In Days Gone, the video game, Big Breaker Zombies are some of the most challenging opponents you'll face. It takes skill, strategy, and determination to take them down. However, with the right method and approach, you can overcome the Big Breaker Zombie and survive another day. 

Here's a two-step method to unlock the ultimate survival guide and take down the Big Breaker Zombie in Days Gone.

# Step One: Spotting the Big Breaker Zombie

Before you can take down the Big Breaker Zombie, you need to find it first. These zombies are huge, and you'll hear them coming from a mile away. They are usually found in Horde gatherings or in abandoned buildings. In the game, you'll get a notification when you're close to one. Once you spot a Big Breaker Zombie, it's time to start planning your attack. 

# Step Two: Taking Down the Big Breaker Zombie

The Big Breaker Zombie has thick armor that can withstand even the most powerful attacks. You need to use a specific weapon to take them down. The best weapon to use is the Napalm Molotov. It's a special type of Molotov cocktail that can burn through the Big Breaker Zombie's armor in just a few seconds. To craft a Napalm Molotov, you need the following:

- One bottle (can be found in most buildings)
- One kerosene (can be found in gas stations)
- One canister (can be found in NERO checkpoints)

Once you have the ingredients, you can craft the Napalm Molotov in your inventory. The next step is to lure the Big Breaker Zombie into an open area where you have enough space to move around. Once the zombie is in place, throw the Napalm Molotov at its feet. The Molotov will burn through the armor, exposing the zombie's weak points. 

Now that the Big Breaker Zombie's weak points are exposed, it's time to go all out with your attacks. Use your most powerful weapons to take down the zombie. You can also use explosives if you have them to add more damage. 

If the Big Breaker Zombie manages to get too close, use the dodge button to avoid its attacks. Keep throwing Napalm Molotovs and attacking the weak points until the zombie is defeated. 

# Conclusion

Surviving in a zombie apocalypse is all about being prepared and having a strategy. With this two-step method, you'll have the ultimate survival guide to take down the Big Breaker Zombie in Days Gone. Remember to stay calm and focused, and you'll come out on top. Good luck, survivor!
