You Won't Believe how Easy it is to Turn Your Website into an App on Microsoft Edge!

Microsoft Edge, the popular web browser from Microsoft, now allows you to turn any website into a standalone app in just a few clicks. This feature has been available for some time now, but it seems that many users are not aware of how easy it is to use.

Turning a website into an app can be particularly useful if you use certain websites frequently and want to access them quickly without having to open your browser and navigate to the site. Additionally, apps run independently of the browser and can even be pinned to the taskbar, making them easier to access.

The best part is that turning a website into an app is incredibly simple. Here's how to do it:

1. Navigate to the website you want to turn into an app in Microsoft Edge.
2. Click on the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the browser and select "Apps."
3. Click on "Install this site as an app."
4. Customize the name and select where you want to save the app, then click on "Install."
5. Your app will now appear on the taskbar, and you can access it like any other app.

It's important to note that not all websites will work well when turned into an app. Some features may not work correctly, such as alerts or notifications, and some sites may not be optimized for use as an app. In such cases, it's best to use your browser to access the site.

Microsoft Edge's feature allows users to take advantage of the benefits of using apps without the need to create one themselves. It's an excellent way to increase productivity, save time, and avoid the clutter of browser tabs.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a fast and straightforward way to turn a website into an app, Microsoft Edge has you covered. With a few easy steps, you can create a standalone app that runs seamlessly on your desktop, giving you quick access to the sites you use most.

The Chromium version of Microsoft Edge comes with Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) support, which makes it possible to install a website as a native app on Windows 10 enabling additional features, such as push notifications, background data refresh, offline support, and more. 
 
If the feature sounds familiar, it’s because in previous versions, Microsoft Edge had a similar functionality known as pins. However, the ability to install web apps from the new version of the browser makes sites available from the Start menu and taskbar. In addition, if the website is capable, you can also use it offline.
 
The most interesting part about web apps for Edge Chromium is that they literally install like normal apps, and you’ll even find them registered in the “Apps & features” settings page.
 
In this guide, you’ll learn the steps to install a website as an app on the new Chromium version of Microsoft Edge.
