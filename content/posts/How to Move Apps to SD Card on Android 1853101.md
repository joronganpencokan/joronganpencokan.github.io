# Revolutionize Your Android Storage- Learn How To Instantly Move Apps To SD Card!

Are you constantly running out of space on your Android phone? Is it becoming a challenge to find enough space to download new apps or save photos and videos? If you're nodding your head, then we have a solution for you. The key to making the most out of your Android phone's storage is by learning how to move your apps to your SD card.

You might be wondering, what is an SD card and how can it help you save space on your phone? An SD card is a small memory device that can be inserted into your phone to provide extra storage space. If you're someone who needs to store a lot of media or files or you like to download a lot of apps, using an SD card can help keep your phone running smoothly.

Now, let's get down to the details on how to move apps to your SD card. Here is a step-by-step guide to get you started:

Step 1: Check if Your Android Phone Supports Moving Apps to SD Card

Not all android phones support moving apps to the SD card – if your phone does not support it, then unfortunately, you won’t be able to transfer apps. However, all phones running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow or later versions do support moving apps to SD card.

To check if your phone supports this feature, go to the settings of your phone and look for 'storage.' On this page, you should see two different sections labeled Internal storage and External storage. If an option to move apps to external storage or SD card is available, then your phone supports this feature.

Step 2: Choose Which Apps to Move

Next, you need to decide which apps you want to move to your SD card. You can move all of your apps or just a few of your most used apps, depending on your preferences.

To choose which apps to move, go to settings on your phone, then click on 'Apps'. This will show you a list of all the apps installed on your device. Choose the apps you want to move and click on their names.

Step 3: Move the App to SD Card

After choosing the app, click on the option 'Storage,' which should show you the different storage options available, including the SD card. Select 'SD card' and then click on 'Move.'

However, not all apps will have the option to move to the SD card. For example, some apps that are fundamental to the phone's operating system, such as pre-installed apps, may not allow you to move them to the SD card.

Step 4: Check if Your App Has Been Successfully Moved to SD Card

You can easily check if the app has been moved onto your SD card - once you've moved your apps, go to ‘Settings’ > ‘Storage and USB’ > 'SD card'. Here you will see how much storage is being used up by apps, pictures, videos, and music stored on your SD card. Also, by going to ‘Settings’ > ‘Apps,’ you can see how much storage space each app is taking up.

In conclusion, learning how to move apps to your SD card can be a game-changer for your Android phone's storage. It helps maximize your phone's storage capacity and enables you to store more media, files, and apps. By following the simple steps outlined above, you can easily revolutionize your Android storage and free up some extra space.

### How to Use SD Card as Internal Storage
 
The above method on how to move apps to SD card on Android is applicable only for cases where the said application supports the storage switching option. An SD card can be used as internal storage memory for apps that do not support this feature as well.

In this scenario, the SD card and internal memory will turn into a large, unified storage device.
 
Note 1: When you use an SD card as an internal storage device, it can only be used in that particular phone, unless you format it.
 
Note 2: Also, the device will function only when the SD card is inserted into it. If you try to remove it, a factory reset will be triggered.
