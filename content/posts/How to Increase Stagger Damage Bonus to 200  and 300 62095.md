# The Ultimate Guide to Crushing your Enemies with Jaw-Dropping Stagger Damage Boosts of 200% and 300%!

Are you tired of fighting opponents that just won't stagger? Do you want to deal massive amounts of damage to your enemies? Fear not, for we have the ultimate guide to crushing your foes with jaw-dropping stagger damage boosts of 200% and 300%!

Before we dive into the details, let's first understand what stagger damage is. Stagger damage is the amount of damage that you deal to an opponent that causes them to stagger, leaving them vulnerable to further attacks. By increasing your stagger damage, you can quickly dispatch your enemies and become an unstoppable force on the battlefield.

## Understanding Stagger Damage

To increase your stagger damage, it's essential to first understand how it works. Stagger damage is calculated by the formula:

```
Stagger Damage = Current Stun Damage x (100 + Stagger Damage Boost)
```

This formula means that the amount of stagger damage you deal is directly proportional to your current stun damage and the Stagger Damage Boost. The more stun damage you deal to an opponent, the higher your stagger damage will be. The Stagger Damage Boost is a percentage-based bonus that increases your stagger damage even further.

## Boosting Stagger Damage

Now that we understand the formula for stagger damage let's delve into the methods of increasing our Stagger Boost Damage!

### Enhance your Weapons

The weapon you use plays a significant role in determining your stagger damage. The higher the weapon's damage output, the more stun damage you will deal to an opponent. Upgrading your weapon and infusing it with a Stagger Damage Boost enchantment will help raise your chances of staggering your enemies. 

### Experiment with Skills

Another way to boost your Stagger boost damage is by experimenting with different skills that boost Stun damage. Try using skills like "Stunning Strike" or "Thunder Strike" to boost your Stun damage output. These skills also provide additional Stagger Boost damage alongside increased stun damage.

### Use Runic skills

Runic skills do not deal Stun damage directly. However, they can still be used to increase your Stagger Boost by utilizing the "Elemental Stagger" perk. This perk doubles your Stagger Boost damage after landing a Runic Attack that inflicts elemental damage on an enemy.

### Enchantments

Enchantments are an excellent way to increase your Stagger Boost damage output. Enchantments like "Staggering" provide a flat increase in Stagger Boost. Meanwhile, "Leviathan's Wake" increases Stagger Boost by 25% when equipped to a Heavy Runic Attack.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, mastering stagger damage is critical to becoming an unstoppable force on the battlefield. By upgrading your weapons, using the right skills, and using the proper enchantments, you can rake in jaw-dropping stagger damage boosts of up to 300%. With this ultimate guide, you won't have to worry about pesky enemies that refuse to stagger again. So, go out there and crush your enemies with ease!

## How to Get Stagger Damage Bonus to 200% and 300%
 
In this guide, you will know exactly how to increase stagger damage bonus to 200% and 300% from the default 160%.
 
### Increasing Stagger Bonus to 200%
 
When Chadley gives you the Battle Intel Report 12, which is The Stagger Effect Pt. 3, you will see that it asks players to increase stagger damage bonus to 200%. This also means that you should have already completed The Stagger Effect Pt. 1 and 2.
 
Here’s the tactic to do it – get into a battle with Fat Chocobo. You need to visit Chadley and select this enemy from Chadley’s VR Missions.
 
In this fight with Fat Chocobo, you can use Tifa because her attacks will ensure that the stagger rates increase to high levels. With her abilities of Rise and Fall, Omnistrike and Whirling Uppercut, you can raise the stagger damage bonus in FF7 Remake. Once the enemy is staggered, use her Unbridled Strength Ability to unleash the mayhem. Just press triangle continuously and the stagger damage bonus will zip ahead from 160% to 200%.
 
### How to Increase the Stagger Damage Bonus to 300%?
 
Want to deal even more damage? You got it! To do this, you need to fight Fat Chocobo with Tifa. Use the Unbridled Strength ability twice when Fat Chocobo’s stagger bar is around 50%. Then use Rise and Fall and Omnistrike. Then, start with Whirling Uppercuts and True Strikes when your ATB is charged. Remember, to use True Strike, you need access to the weapon Purple Pain from Chapter 16.
 
Another way to get your stagger damage bonus to 300% is when Aerith uses Ray of Judgement and Cloud uses Focused Thrust. A simple tip to ensure that Fat Chocobo stays alive until you reach 300% is to equip your party members with weapons having the lowest damage. Once you reach 300%, you will earn the Staggering Feat trophy.
 
So this is how you can increase the stagger damage bonus to 200% and 300% in Final Fantasy VII Remake. For more useful tips, tricks, unlocks and cheats, check out our complete Final Fantasy 7 Remake Wiki Guide.
