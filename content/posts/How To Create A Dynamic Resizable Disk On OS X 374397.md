Introducing the one simple trick to create a resizable disk on your Mac. This innovative technique will allow you to easily and quickly re-allocate storage space as needed, providing you with the flexibility and freedom to use your computer as you see fit.

In the past, creating a resizable disk on a Mac was a complicated and time-consuming process. However, with modern software and operating systems, it is now possible to create a resizable disk in just a few simple steps.

Step 1: Open Disk Utility

First, open Disk Utility on your Mac by searching for it in Spotlight or locating it in the Applications folder. Once open, select the volume or partition you wish to resize.

Step 2: Choose “Partition”

In the toolbar at the top of the Disk Utility window, click on the “Partition” button. This will open the partitioning tool.

In the partitioning tool, you will see a graphical representation of your current disk layout. To resize your disk, simply click and drag the divider between the two partitions to adjust the size of each partition. When you are satisfied with the new sizes, click “Apply” to confirm the changes.

Step 4: Enjoy Your Resizable Disk

Once Disk Utility completes the resizing process, you can now enjoy your newly created resizable disk! You can easily adjust the size of each partition in the future as your storage needs change.

By using this simple trick, you can revolutionize the way you use your Mac and never worry about running out of storage again. Whether you’re working on large video projects, storing large files, or just need more space for your everyday activities, a resizable disk provides you with the flexibility and freedom to use your computer as you see fit.

The main mode for packaging program files for distributions and storage on OS X is Disk Images. These images imitate exactly the behaviours of optical disks such as DVDs, which is the reason they are commonly used by most developers worldwide to distribute downloadable installers for their programs/applications. If you don’t know what a Disk Image is, remember the file you need to download whenever you choose to install some freeware software from the internet, such as Google Chrome? You need to click on the file, and then it “mounts.” From the opening window, you choose to install the program. The original file you downloaded is called a “Disk Image.”
 
Disk Images are indeed most useful for file distribution, but they can also be used to store files on your system, any external media or on a local network server. The server option is most useful if you want to encrypt your files so that no one else can access them.
 
To create a Disk Image on your OS X system, simply follow the steps below:
 
1. Open Disk Utility on your Mac, either by accessing it by Spotlight or by navigating to “Applications -> Utilities -> Disk Utility”.
 

 
2. Select “New Image” from the top row of options in Disk Utility.
 
3. A drop-down menu similar to the one below will show up. Here, you can name your image and set its size. For this tutorial, we’ve set it as 500MB, but you can set a size according to your own preferences.
 
(Tidbit: You can also encrypt your disk image here by using the “Encrypt” tab.)
 
4. Once you’re done tweaking the settings, click on “Create.”
 
Once created, the image will create and mount where you can copy files to it. However, you’ll notice that even if you don’t fill the 500MB image size, i.e if you enter less than 500MB of data, the image size will still be the same when you created it. So if you created an image that was 500MB in size, then the image file would be 500MB, even if there is only 90MB of data in it.
 
Now, this may seem logical to some people, but it might not be desired. You may want your disk to be able to contain 500MB of data but not always be 500MB on disk and only grow with the size of items you place in it. A dynamic resizable disk in OS X by following the below instructions:
 
## How to “Sparse” or “Sparsebundle” Your Image With No Partition Scheme
 
Apple has included the options in Disk Utility to create “sparse” and “sparsebundle” image types. These images are dynamically resizable, meaning, if you create one without a partition, they will start with the size of the files you place in them. They’ll then grow as you keep on adding more files, up to the maximum size you set when creating the image.
 
To do this, when you’re creating your Disk Image using the steps above, simply select either “sparse” or “sparsebundle” from the “Image Format” menu when creating the image, and then choose “No Partition Map” from the “Partitions” menu, similar to the screenshot below:
