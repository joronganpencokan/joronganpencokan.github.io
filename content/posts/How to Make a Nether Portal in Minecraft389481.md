# Unleash Your Inner Minecraft Wizard: Learn How To Create A Mind-Bending Nether Portal Today!

Minecraft has become one of the most popular video games in the world. It allows you to explore, build, and create to your heart's content. One of the many features that make Minecraft so popular is its Nether Dimension. The Nether is a dangerous place where players can find rare resources and uncover hidden secrets. The only way to get there is through a Nether portal. In this guide, you'll learn how to create a mind-bending Nether portal that will transport you to a whole new world.

## Step 1: Gathering Materials

Before you start creating your portal, you'll need to collect some materials. These include:

- 14 Obsidian Blocks
- Flint and Steel
- Diamond Pickaxe

You can mine Obsidian blocks with a Diamond Pickaxe. It's a challenging material to acquire because it requires a lot of time and patience. Once you've collected enough Obsidian, you're ready to build your portal.

## Step 2: Building Your Portal

The Nether portal is a rectangular frame made of Obsidian blocks. You'll need to create the frame first, so make sure you have enough Obsidian to do so. Follow these steps to build your portal:

1. Choose a location for your portal. You'll need a minimum of four Obsidian blocks for the frame, so plan accordingly.
2. Take your Diamond Pickaxe and use it to dig a 2x3 hole in the ground.
3. Place two Obsidian blocks on either side of the hole, making sure they're vertically aligned. You should now have a 2x3 frame that's 2 blocks high.
4. Place two more Obsidian blocks on top of the first two.
5. Complete the top layer of the frame by placing two more Obsidian blocks on the sides.
6. Fill in the bottom layer of the frame with Obsidian.
7. Your last step is to light the portal with Flint and Steel. To do this, right-click on the bottom of the portal with Flint and Steel.

## Step 3: Entering the Nether

Congratulations! You've successfully built your Nether portal. It's time to enter the Nether.

1. Walk into the portal you just created.
2. You'll see a loading screen as the game loads the Nether.
3. Once you're through, you'll be in the Nether Dimension.

## Step 4: Exploring the Nether

The Nether Dimension is a hostile place filled with dangerous creatures like Ghasts and Zombie Pigmen. The landscape is also treacherous, with lava lakes and soul sand. However, there are plenty of resources waiting to be discovered.

You'll find resources like:

- Glowstone
- Nether Quartz
- Nether Wart
- Soul Sand
- Nether Fortresses

Take your time exploring the Nether and be on the lookout for hidden secrets.

## Conclusion

Creating a Nether portal in Minecraft is a great way to unleash your inner wizard. It opens up a whole new world of exploration and discovery. While building your portal may be challenging, it's well worth the effort. Happy exploring!

If you want to visit the fiery underworld, you need to know how to make a Nether Portal in Minecraft. Here's all the information you need, including the correct Nether Portal dimensions and how to build your portal.

 
##   What Do You Need to Make a Nether Portal?  
 

Nether Portals offer a gateway to the Nether, Minecraft's underworld. There are a few ways to construct Nether Portals, but they always require the same materials:

 
Instructions in this article apply to Minecraft for all platforms including Windows, PS4, and Xbox One.
 
- At least 14 obsidian blocksAn item that can create fire, such as lava, a fire charge, or flint and steel

 

The minimum dimensions for a Nether Portal are four obsidian wide and five obsidian high (for a total of 14 obsidian blocks). If you'd like, you can construct even larger frames and build adjacent Nether Portals that share sides.

 
##   How to Make a Nether Portal in Minecraft  
 

Follow these steps to construct a portal to the Nether:

 
Mobs can also travel through portals, so they can follow you from the overworld to the Nether and vice-versa.
 
- Add obsidian and your combustible block (fire charge, flint and steel, etc.) to your hot bar.
 - Place four obsidian blocks on the ground side-by-side.
 - You cannot build Nether Portals underwater or in the End.
 - Place four obsidian blocks on top of one edge.
 - To stack blocks vertically, stand on top of the block you want to stack upon and jump, then place the blocks below you while you're in the air.
 - Place four obsidian blocks on top of the other edge.
 - Place two obsidian between the edges of the vertical blocks to connect the frame.
 - Select your combustible block and drop it inside the frame to activate the portal. The inside of the portal should glow purple.
 - Jump inside the frame to teleport to the Nether.

 

When you arrive, the portal you built will follow you. To return to the overworld, reenter the portal.

##   How Much Obsidian You Need and Where to Get It  
 

You'll need at least 14 obsidian per Nether portal, so you should collect as much as possible. To mine obsidian in Minecraft:

 
The Nether randomly generates just like the overworld; however, there is only one Nether per world, so each portal you make will link to the same Nether.
 
- Make a crafting table using four wood planks. Any type of wood will do (Warped Planks, Crimson Planks, etc.).
 - Place your crafting table on the ground and interact with it to access the 3X3 crafting grid.
 - Craft a diamond pickaxe. In the 3x3 crafting grid, place three diamonds in the top row, then place sticks in the middle of the second and third rows.
 - Craft a bucket. Open the 3x3 crafting grid, place iron ingots in the first and third blocks in the top row, then place an iron ingot in the middle of the second row.
 - Use the bucket to scoop up some water.
 - Find some lava and pour the water on it.
 - Use the diamond pickaxe to mine the obsidian.
 - The diamond pickaxe is the only tool capable of mining obsidian.

 
##   How to Deactivate Portals  
 

There are a few things that can deactivate Nether Portals:

Although the obsidian frame can withstand explosions, the portal itself cannot. Nether Portals can be reactivated the same way you originally activated them.

 
##   How to Link Nether Portals  
 

Anytime you make a new Nether Portal, a link between the Nether and the overworld is created. Portals work both ways, so you can go back and forth. Once you're in the Nether, you can place portals in strategic locations to create shortcuts to the overworld.

 
To protect your portals, shelter them with cobblestone or other blast-resistant stone bricks.
 

The Nether is smaller than the overworld by a ratio of 8:1 on the X-axis. In other words, if you move one block to the left or right on the map while in the Nether, you will have moved the equivalent of eight blocks in the overworld. The Y-axis ratio is 1:1, so this doesn't apply when moving up or down on the map.

 
You can create as many portals as you like; however, if you place multiple portals in close proximity, they will lead to the same spot.
