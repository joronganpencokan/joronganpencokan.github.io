# Is Google's New Chromebook Pixel REALLY Worth $1,299? We Investigated and Here's What We Found!

The Chromebook Pixel has always been Google's flagship device for showcasing the capabilities of Chrome OS. The first Pixel was released in 2013, followed by an updated version in 2015. Google has now released the third iteration of the Pixel, the Chromebook Pixel 2017, which promises to be the ultimate Chromebook experience.

The Chromebook Pixel has always been pricey, but the 2017 model takes it to another level. With a starting price of $1,299, it's one of the most expensive Chromebooks on the market. The question is, is it really worth the price tag? We decided to investigate and find out what makes the 2017 Chromebook Pixel unique and whether it's worth the premium price.

## Design and Build Quality

The design of the Chromebook Pixel 2017 is sleek and modern, much like its predecessors. The laptop has a 12.3-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 2400 x 1600, which is one of the brightest and most beautiful screens we've seen on a laptop. The Pixel has a unibody aluminum design, which gives it a premium look and feel. The laptop is also incredibly thin, measuring just 10.3mm in thickness.

The build quality of the Chromebook Pixel 2017 is exceptional. The device feels solid and well-made, with no flex or creaking when pressure is applied to it. The hinges are strong and sturdy, and the overall construction of the device gives us the confidence that it will last for years to come.

## Performance

The Chromebook Pixel 2017 is powered by an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and has a 512GB SSD. The device is incredibly fast and responsive, with no lag or stuttering even when performing demanding tasks. Chrome OS is a lightweight operating system, and the Pixel's hardware takes full advantage of it, making it a pleasure to use.

The keyboard and trackpad on the Chromebook Pixel 2017 are also top-notch. The keyboard is backlit, and the keys have a satisfying tactile response when typing. The trackpad is large and easy to use, with support for multi-touch gestures.

## Connectivity

The connectivity of the Chromebook Pixel 2017 is adequate, but not exceptional. The laptop has two USB-C ports, which can be used for charging, data transfer, and connecting peripherals. There's also a 3.5mm headphone jack, but no SD card slot, which can be a downside for some users.

## Battery Life

The battery life of the Chromebook Pixel 2017 is decent, but not outstanding. Google claims that the laptop can last up to ten hours on a single charge, but in our tests, we found that it lasted about eight hours with moderate use. While this isn't bad, it's not as good as some other high-end laptops on the market.

## Conclusion

So, is the Chromebook Pixel 2017 worth the $1,299 price tag? It depends on what you're looking for in a laptop. If you're a power user who needs a portable machine that can handle demanding tasks, then the Pixel is an excellent choice. The device's hardware is top-notch, and the software is snappy and responsive.

However, if you're looking for a more budget-friendly laptop, there are plenty of other great options on the market. Chromebooks in general are known for being affordable, and many people choose them for their simplicity and ease of use. If you're looking for a laptop that gets the job done without breaking the bank, then the Chromebook Pixel 2017 may not be the best choice for you.

Overall, the Chromebook Pixel 2017 is a fantastic device that showcases the best of what Chrome OS has to offer. If you're willing to pay the premium price, then it's a laptop that won't disappoint. However, if you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, there are plenty of other great Chromebooks on the market that may better suit your needs.

Google unveiled its first home-brewed laptop called Chromebook Pixel, and it’s the first premium device of its kind built by the search giant itself. It also happens to have a Retina Display like the Apple’s MacBook Pro, which could be described as the most noticeable feature.
 
According to Google, the 2560 x 1700 pixels, 12.85-inch multi-touch display protected by Gorilla Glass, is the largest screen resolution (239 pixels per inch) ever bundled on a laptop. But it has a particularity, it’s a 3:2 aspect ratio display, which the company says helps to better fit web content, because most of the time people consume content on a vertical orientation.
 
On the contrary to other Chromebooks from ASUS, Lenovo, Samsung and HP, this laptop is very powerful, ready to take on demanding tasks. It packs a Core i5 CPU with an Intel HD 4000 graphics processor and 4GB of RAM, two USB 2.0, a mini display port, a combo 3.5mm headset jack, an SD card slot to add more storage, Bluetooth 3.0, and a 720p webcam located atop between two microphones.
 
Google says that Chromebook Pixel can play more than one full-HD, 1080p video simultaneously. The downside, though, is that because of high-performance processor and high-resolution display results on poor battery life — the company expects about 5-hours on one charge –. With these specs Pixel is well-equipped to compete hand-by-hand with most Windows ultrabooks in the market today.

Pixel also share some similarities with the MacBook Air design. For example, it includes hidden speakers, vents located in the hinge, and a thin LED-backlit keyboard.
 
Although, there are many aspects of Chromebook Pixel that are similar to the Apple’s design, it’s not a copycat. Google is somewhat trying make it better by featuring rounded edges, a very comfortable touchpad “made from etched glass”, a dedicated mic to reduce keyboard noise while on VoIP calls or video chats. The company also paid very close attention to the hinge, that way users can lift the lid without lifting the front of the laptop.
 
The device also packed a gorgeous touchscreen, that the search giant emphasizes it’s responsive and fluid making possible for developers to bring their mobile apps to Pixel, but the reality is that the touch-enabled display isn’t as responsive or fluid as advertised — Google’s real-time demo shows that touch can really take advantage from new improvement.
 
Google is offering two versions of Chromebook Pixel, one bundled with a Verizon LTE modem and one with Wi-Fi.
 
The one with Verizon modem will ship with 64GB of internal storage and it will be on sale starting April for $1,449. The Wi-Fi version of the device will ship with 32GB of storage, and it is available now for $1,299. Orders start shipping as early as next week. Both models will also come a 1TB of Google Drive cloud storage, per user, for the first three years at no extra cost.
 
Chromebook Pixel is clearly a luxury product, which is focus on running web apps and to consume online content. However, it’s very high-priced for a laptop running a fairly new operating system without an app ecosystem like Microsoft Windows or Apple has, and even more with a screen size that the company still doesn’t know if it’s ever going to take-off and be welcomed by everyone. Today, you can get a premium ultrabook for less than $1,299 advertised by Google. You can even get a Microsoft Surface Pro with similar specs and battery life, with a really responsive ten-point multi-touch display, and with an unmatchable catalog of applications (e.g., Office, Photoshop, iTunes, etc.) to really take on any task.
