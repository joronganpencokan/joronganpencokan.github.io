In today's fast-paced world, time management has become an essential skill. With the increasing demands of work and personal commitments, we often find ourselves struggling to keep up. Fortunately, the Windows 10 operating system comes equipped with several built-in tools designed to help users manage their time more effectively. One such tool is the Genius Trick, which offers an effective way to track your time and increase your productivity.

The Genius Trick is a simple but powerful feature that has been designed to help users monitor their computer usage. When enabled, it records the amount of time you spend on each application, website, and even specific files. With this information, you can identify where you are wasting time and make the necessary adjustments to be more productive.

Here's how you can enable the Genius Trick on Windows 10:

Step 1: Click on the Start menu and navigate to Settings.

Step 2: Click on Privacy, then select Activity history.

Step 3: Check the box next to "Let Windows collect my activities from this PC."

Step 4: Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the option that says "Manage my activity info."

Step 5: Scroll down again and select "Turn on system-wide activity tracking."

Once you've enabled the Genius Trick, it will automatically start tracking your computer usage. You can view your activity information by clicking on the Start menu and selecting Timeline. This will show you a detailed breakdown of your activity, including the applications you've used, the websites you've visited, and the documents you've worked on.

By analyzing this information, you can identify any areas where you are wasting time and make changes to improve your productivity. For example, if you notice that you spend too much time on social media, you can limit your access to these sites during work hours. Alternatively, if you find that you spend a lot of time on email, you can start to batch your messages and respond to them at specific times of the day.

Another useful feature of the Genius Trick is the ability to create virtual desktops. This can be an effective way to separate work-related tasks from personal ones, allowing you to focus more effectively. To create a virtual desktop, simply click on the Task View icon in the taskbar and select "New desktop." You can then switch between your virtual desktops by pressing Windows + Tab.

In conclusion, the Genius Trick is an incredibly useful tool for anyone looking to manage their time more effectively on Windows 10.

It’s easier than you may think to limit screen time in Windows. All you need is a Microsoft account. Microsoft gives the option to create family groups which include all of your family accounts, including children. From there, you can actually set limits on your child’s devices. Instead of worrying about device usage late at night or while you’re busy working, your child can only use their device during the hours you set.
 
## Limiting Screen Time
 
It’s hard to constantly monitor your child’s screen time. They can easily use a computer after you go to bed or while you’re at work. However, many parental control apps and software aren’t cheap or easy to use. You don’t have to just hope your kid will do what you ask. Using the free control provided by Microsoft, you get control over what your child does on any device they log into using their own Microsoft account.
 
## Microsoft Family Account
 
Every member of your family can have their own Microsoft account. You can then create a family group to manage all of the accounts. If you already have a family group, the process of limiting screen time is even easier. Log in to your family account to get started.
 
If you don’t have a family group yet, you can set one up using your current Microsoft login. Visit the Microsoft Family page to start the process. Click “Create a family group” and follow the prompts. Once the group is set up, it’s time to add members. In your Family account, choose “Add a family member.” Select “Member” and enter their email address to invite them. They have to accept your invitation to join the group.
 
## Setting Up a Child Account
 
To limit screen time in Windows, you’ll need to create a child account for your child to join the family group. If your child already has an email address, open your Microsoft Family account and choose “Add a child.” Enter their email address. If you know their password, select “Sign my child in.” If not, select “Send invitation” and ask your child to accept the invitation.
 
If your child doesn’t have an email address, click “Create a new email address for your child.” When you create the account and choose your child’s age, you’ll receive a notification in your own Microsoft account to approve it since your child’s a minor.
 
Once you confirm your child’s account using any of the three methods, you’ll receive a confirmation and be able to start managing their screen time.
 
## Setting Limits for Windows 10
 
Once everything else is set up, it’s time to start setting limits. In your Microsoft account, go to “Your Family.” You’ll see all family members listed. Under your child’s name, select “Screen Time.” You’ll also notice that each family member has a number of devices, too. When setting screen time, you can set it for all devices or individual devices.
 
To set the same schedule, choose “Use one schedule for all devices”. Set times by choosing the allowed usage times beside the row for each day of the week. Use the drop-down box beside each day to set the maximum number of hours per day. For instance, you may set Friday’s time usage for four hours within the time range of 1:00 PM to 8 PM.
 
When it comes to Xbox, you’ll have to add your child to your Xbox from the Xbox. You’ll set up your child’s account, then once added, the restrictions you set in your Microsoft account apply to the Xbox too as long as the schedule applies to all devices. You can set device restrictions individually in your Microsoft account as well.
 
Ensure you set a password for your Xbox account so your child doesn’t change anything or simply use your account to play. Also, if you don’t want your child to access certain websites, try blocking the websites with the hosts file.
