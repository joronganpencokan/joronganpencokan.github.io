# Ultimate Battle of the Smart Speakers - Who Will Win? Google Home vs Apple HomePod!

Smart speakers have become an integral part of modern homes, offering smart features and virtual assistants to help users with their daily tasks. There are multiple smart speakers available in the market, but two of the most popular speakers are Google Home and Apple HomePod. In this article, we will compare these two smart speakers and try to determine which one is the ultimate winner.

## Design

The Google Home has a cylindrical design that looks simple and sleek. It is available in a few different colors and matches any décor of your home. Its fabric finish offers a nice texture and feels great to the touch.

On the other hand, the Apple HomePod offers a unique design. It looks like a small, squashed bean and features a mesh top with a seamless touchpad. HomePod only comes in two colors, white and space gray, which might not match everyone’s interior.

Overall, Google Home scores points for its minimalist design and range of color options. Apple HomePod’s design might be a divisive factor among users.

## Sound Quality

Without any doubt, Apple HomePod is the winner when it comes to sound quality. It features an incredibly powerful speaker system that is capable of producing deep bass, detailed vocals, and clear trebles. The speakers on Google Home are not as high-quality, but they are still capable of providing decent sound quality for casual listening or creating a comfortable atmosphere.

## Virtual Assistant

Both Google Home and Apple HomePod come equipped with virtual assistants – Google Assistant and Siri, respectively. Google Assistant is known for its superior functionality. It can answer a wide range of questions, perform various tasks, and integrates smoothly with Google products like Gmail, Google Maps, and Calendar.

Siri, on the other hand, is still playing catch-up. While Siri on the HomePod is much more proficient than on other Apple products, it still has some way to go to match the capabilities of Google’s Assistant.

## Privacy

Privacy is an important aspect that many people are concerned about when it comes to smart speakers. Both Google Home and Apple HomePod come with ways to control privacy.

Google Home has a microphone mute switch that will turn off the device’s microphones when activated. Apple HomePod, on the other hand, features a physical mute button that silences the HomePod and disables Siri.

## Compatibility

Google Home is compatible with a wide range of smart home devices, such as Nest thermostats, Philips Hue lights, and more. Meanwhile, Apple HomePod is only compatible with a limited number of smart devices, including those with Apple’s HomeKit standard.

## Price

When it comes to price, Google Home is undoubtedly the better option. Its price tag is almost half of the Apple HomePod’s cost. Google Home’s affordability makes it perfect for users who want to dip their toes into the smart speaker market without spending too much.

## Final Verdict

In conclusion, both Google Home and Apple HomePod have their unique strengths and weaknesses. Google Home’s design is more attractive, and it’s compatible with a broader range of smart home devices. Meanwhile, Apple HomePod has superior sound quality and privacy features.

Ultimately, the choice between these two speakers comes down to personal preference. If you’re heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem and want a speaker with unparalleled sound quality, HomePod is the perfect match. But, if you’re looking for a speaker that’s affordable and offers a range of smart home device compatibility, Google Home is the one for you.

With so many similar options available, it's hard to figure out which smart speaker is the best choice to welcome into your home. While the Apple HomePod was released after the Google Home, they are closer in age than you might expect. We compare the two in several key areas to help you make the best choice for you.

 
##   Overall Findings  
 

Deciding whether HomePod or Google Home is the best device for you depends on how you plan to use it. Both speakers can do the same kinds of things—answer questions, set timers, control smart-home devices, stream music—but the ways they do them, and the tools they use, can be different.

 
- Draws on Google's vast database.
 - Supports third-party music streaming apps.
 - Support for multi-room audio.
 - Controls major smart home devices.

 
- More limited than Google when accessing information and performing tasks.
 - Lacks built-in support for services other than Apple Music.
 - Best-in-class sound quality.
 - Controls major smart home devices.

 
##   The Best Intelligent Assistant: Google Is Hard to Beat  
 

The thing that makes a smart speaker smart is the intelligent assistant that listens for your voice and responds to your commands. It's not the only factor in deciding which speaker is best for you, but it's a big one.

 
- Google Assistant is a powerful, flexible tool.
 - Draws on Google's database of information; it's great at answering questions.
 - Supports third-party apps and actions.
 - Doesn't support secondary calendars.
 - When multiple devices are near each other, all respond to the "OK Google" launch phrase.

 
- "Hey Siri" is smart enough to only have the correct device respond when prompted.
 - Siri is more limited than Google Assistant when it comes to accessing information and performing tasks.
 - HomePod doesn't allow third-party apps or skills on the device (but some iPhone apps can have them added).

 

There's no question that Google Assistant is far ahead of Siri. Siri responds well to a limited set of commands and questions, but Google Assistant responds well to a wider set of scenarios and draws from a larger pool of information.

 
##   Streaming Music: It's a Tie  
 

Streaming music is one of the best uses for a smart speaker. Just shouting out "play some happy music" is both a fun trick and a great mood lifter. Both speakers can play virtually any streaming music service you prefer. The difference is built-in support.

 
- Supports YouTube Music, which is not naturally supported on other smart speakers.
 - Built-in support for Spotify, iHeartRadio, and others.
 - No Apple Music support.

 
- Built-in support for Apple Music.
 - Other music services streamed using Airplay.
 - Lack of built-in support for services other than Apple Music.

 

HomePod delivers Apple Music support, which means it can be controlled via voice, but it supports all streaming over AirPlay. The same is true for Google Home, except it has built-in support for Google services and streams over Bluetooth. Your preferred service should guide your decision, but fundamentally, you can stream virtually anything on both devices.

 
##   Sound Quality: Apple Is Best-in-Class  
 

The range of music services supported by a smart speaker isn't the only thing to pay attention to. Your music and podcasts should sound fantastic. Apple has positioned HomePod as an audio device first, a smart speaker second, and it shows in the sound quality. It sounds clear, detailed, and huge. Google Home delivers decent sound, but can't match the room-rattling HomePod.

 
- Support for multi-room audio (all Google Home devices in the house play the same audio).
 - Lower-quality sound than HomePod.

 
- Best sound quality among all smart speakers, according to different tests.
 - Siri can hear you even when audio volume is high, so you don't have to shout.

 
##   Smart Home: Control Your Thermostat, Lights, And More  
 

If you're making your home smarter with internet-connected, app-controlled smart home gadgets, both HomePod and Home can help. You can speak to either device and ask them to raise or lower the temperature, turn off the lights, or perform other tasks.

 
##   Messaging and Calls: To Text or Not to Text  
 

With a smart speaker in your house, sending texts and making phone calls doesn't require your smartphone. Both Home and HomePod have some notable limitations in these areas. HomePod has a slight edge since it supports calls and texts, with a few hiccups. Google Home only sends texts with awkward workarounds. Neither option is ideal.

 
- Make calls directly from Google Home.
 - No official support for text messaging.

 
- Siri reads and sends text messages.
 - Support for multiple texting apps, including Apple Messages and WeChat.
 - Can't make calls directly, only transfers calls started on iPhone to HomePod.

 
##   Form Factor and Use in the House: Google Gets Colorful  
 

Different rooms and uses may call for smart speakers that come in different shapes and styles. The HomePod is typical of Apple hardware. It is beautifully designed, built to the highest standards, but also somewhat limited in its style options. If versatility and adaptability are what you want out of your smart speaker, Google Home—with its multiple sizes and colors—is your best bet.

 
- Three different sizes for different uses and rooms.
 - Mini comes in four colors—white, slate, aqua, and coral.

 
- Comes in black or white.
 - Attractive styling.
 - High-quality construction and materials.

 
##   Multiple Users: Tools For the Whole Family  
 

If you have more than one person in your household, you'll have more than one person who wants to use your smart speaker. But different smart speakers work with multiple users in different ways.

 
- Supports up to six users​ and recognizes their voices.
 - Responds with individualized content, such as calendars and playlists.
 - Can't delete, edit, or cancel events by voice.

 
- Add notes, reminders, and other content.
 - Only works for the owner of the iPhone that was originally used to set up the device.
 - No multi-user support.

 
##   Ecosystem Integration: Access a Broad Range of Services  
 

When buying a smart speaker, get one that works well with the broadest range of services and gadgets you use. That kind of compatibility makes these devices most useful. Similar to the streaming music services category, this one is mostly a toss-up that is determined by what ecosystem you invested in. If you own Apple products, HomePod will interact with them smoothly and offer deep connections. On the other hand, Google fans will find Home gives them the best experience.

 
- Deep integration with Google services and devices, such as Chromecast.
 - No connection to Apple services.

 
- Deep integration with Apple services like Apple Music, iCloud, and iMessage.
 - No connection to Google services.

 
##   Final Verdict: Google Home Stands Out  
 

When comparing just Google Home vs. Apple HomePod, Home stands out with its advanced features, multi-user support, and third-party apps. The smarts in the smart speaker are also an advantage. Google Assistant is a lot smarter than Siri. 

 

HomePod is a great device if you primarily want to use it for music and other types of audio playback. But if you're looking for a versatile smart speaker with a well-rounded feature set, Google Home is the pick.
