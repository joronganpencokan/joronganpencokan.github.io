# You've been managing iPhone contacts WRONG this whole time - Here's the correct way!

Are you struggling to manage your iPhone contacts? Do you feel like your contacts list is a mess and disorganized? Fear not, as you are not alone.

Managing iPhone contacts can be a headache, especially when you have a lot of them. Fortunately, there is a correct way to manage them, and it's quite simple.

## Using Groups

The first thing you want to do when managing iPhone contacts is to create groups. Not only will this help you stay organized, but it will also make it easier to find specific contacts. You can create groups based on multiple criteria, such as family, friends, work, school, and so on.

To create a group, simply go to your contacts app and tap on the “+” button in the top right corner. Next, select “New Group” and name your group accordingly. You can then add contacts to the group by tapping on the contact name and selecting “Add to Group.”

## Merge Duplicates

Do you have multiple entries for the same contact? This is a common issue, especially if you've synced your iPhone with various sources. The good news is, you can easily merge duplicates.

To do this, go to your contacts app and select the contact that has duplicate entries. Next, tap on the “Edit” button and scroll down to find the “Linked Contacts” option. Here, you'll see all the contacts that are linked to the one you're editing. Simply tap on “Merge Contact” to combine the duplicates into one entry.

## Use iCloud to Sync

Syncing your iPhone contacts across multiple devices can also be a headache. However, using iCloud to sync your contacts is the easiest and most efficient way.

To do this, go to your iPhone settings, select “iCloud,” and turn on the “Contacts” toggle. Next, go to your iCloud account on your computer and enable contact syncing. This way, any changes you make to your contacts on your iPhone will be automatically synced to your computer, and any other devices logged into your iCloud account.

## Conclusion

Managing iPhone contacts can be overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be. By creating groups, merging duplicates, and using iCloud to sync, you can easily keep your contacts organized and up-to-date. So, if you've been managing your contacts the wrong way this whole time, now is the perfect time to make the switch. Give these tips a try and see the difference they make!
