Hemp, commonly known as weed, is illegal in most of the countries all over the world. It is a source of joy for many of us, but not getting it when we want or need it sucks. Many of the celebrities use hemp for pain relief and several other purposes, so do the common people. However, we are not here to talk about the real weed. We are here to tell you something about a mobile game called Hemp Blocks, on which you play with the small blocks of hemp and other similar intoxicating items.
 

 
Hemp Blocks, which is currently available only for iOS (iPhones and iPads), is a puzzle game. While playing this game, your ultimate goal is to unblock the white hemp blocks by removing other blocks. In this game, you will have to slide other blocks out of the way with as less movements as possible, and  then you will be able to unlock the Hemp Blocks and achieve the target of the game.
 
The difficulty range in the Hemp Blocks game range from easy to extreme, and there are 80 levels in total. That will be more than enough to keep you busy when you are having a lonely time and want to play a nice game in your iPhone. After you install the game and start playing, this game is addictive enough that you will even forget the real hemp and get into this. Thank me later, about that.
 
Please note that you have to be at least 17 years old to download this app to your iPhone, since this game extensively uses the icons of Alcohol, Tobacco, Drug Use and Marijuana items. Hence, don’t even try if you are younger than 17 years old, as this game is not intended and designed for you, you should grow old enough first to enjoy it. However, even if you are the person to literally hate the items like weed and alcohol, you should give it a go once, and we give you a strong warning that you will get addicted to it.
