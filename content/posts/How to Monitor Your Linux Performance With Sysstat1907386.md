Introduction

As a Linux user, one of the primary concerns you may have is how to boost your system's performance. Poor system performance can be incredibly frustrating, resulting in sluggish or laggy performance, slow response times and delays in executing commands. If you're experiencing any of these issues, fear not because, in this article, we will be unveiling the secret to boosting your Linux performance with expert sysstat tips.

What is Sysstat?

Sysstat is a performance monitoring tool for Linux systems that allows you to collect and view system resource usage information. It provides a wide variety of features, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, network traffic, disk I/O, and much more. Sysstat provides real-time and historical performance statistics, and it also archives performance data, allowing you to analyze it further.

Here are expert Sysstat tips to boost your system's performance:

1. Collect Regular System Metrics

Sysstat collects system metrics at predefined intervals and stores them in binary data files in the /var/log/sysstat directory. To view saved data, you can use the sysstat utilities or any third-party tools. To enable sysstat, install the package using the package manager of your Linux distribution. Once you have installed sysstat, activate it by running the following command:

sudo systemctl enable sysstat

then start the service by running the following the command:

sudo systemctl start sysstat

Sysstat will collect system metrics every ten minutes and store them in the /var/log/sysstat directory.

2. Enable Extended Data Collection

By default, sysstat only collects basic system metrics. To enable extended data collection, you can edit the /etc/sysconfig/sysstat file and add the following entries:

ENABLED="true"  
 SA1_OPTIONS="-S DISK"   
SA2_OPTIONS="-A"

This configures sysstat to collect additional data on disk I/O, providing additional information on how your system's disk is used. With extended data collection enabled, you can analyze disk usage over time and identify any potential bottlenecks.

3. Analyze System Resource Usage

Once you have collected system metrics, you can analyze the data to identify potential performance issues. The sar command allows you to view system metrics collected by sysstat. For example, if you want to view CPU usage for the last hour, run the following command:

sar -u -s 09:00:00 -e 10:00:00

This command will display CPU usage stats for the hour between 9:00 and 10:00 am. You can also use the sar command to generate detailed reports on system resource usage.

4. Monitor Network Traffic

Sysstat can also monitor network traffic, allowing you to identify any potential network bottlenecks. The sar command can display network statistics such as bytes sent and received, network utilization, and much more. For example, if you want to view network statistics for the last hour, run the following command:

sar -n DEV -s 09:00:00 -e 10:00:00

This command will display network traffic statistics for the hour between 9:00 and 10:00 am. You can also analyze network traffic over time to identify any potential issues.

5. Use Disk I/O Monitoring

Disk I/O monitoring is a powerful feature of sysstat that allows you to identify any disk-related performance issues. Sysstat can collect disk I/O stats, such as the number of read and write requests, read and write times, and much more. For example, if you want to view disk I/O statistics for the last hour, run the following command:

sar -b -s 09:00:00 -e 10:00:00

This command will display disk I/O statistics for the hour between 9:00 and 10:00 am. By monitoring disk I/O stats over time, you can identify and address any potential disk-related performance issues.

Conclusion

In this article, we have unveiled the secret to boosting your Linux performance by using expert sysstat tips. By collecting regular system metrics, enabling extended data collection, analyzing system resource usage, monitoring network traffic, and using disk I/O monitoring, you can identify and address potential performance issues, resulting in a faster and more efficient system. With sysstat, you have a powerful tool to optimize your Linux system performance.

Sysstat is a powerful logging and monitoring tool for Linux/Unix systems. It can be used to monitor system performance and troubleshoot problems. Though many distros have GUI based monitoring applications and API’s, sysstat is a go-to for power users and can log and track pretty much everything going on within your Linux box.

 
## Installation
 
To install sysstat on a RedHat based variant using yum:
 
To install on a Debian based variant using apt:
 
If you are using a Ubuntu-based distro, you should be able to find sysstat in the software manager.
 

 
After the installation, you will need to edit the configuration file to run the daemon. 
 
In the terminal:
 
and set the “sadc” variable to true by changing the line to ENABLED="true". 
 
Save and close the file. Finally, start the daemon:
 
## Common usage of Sysstat
 
The sysstat suite is obviously a collection of very extensive and detailed application. Here are some basic ways to use the tools in  order to gain a feel for its troubleshooting guidance.
 
### Check CPU usage
 
To check CPU usage stats for the current day (by default sar tracks the data every 10 minutes):
 
To display real-time CPU usage for a given amount of time, you can specify the intervals in seconds followed by how many entries you want to report. For example: the following will report total CPU usage every 2 seconds for a total of 10 times:
 
Most PCs have multiple cores nowadays. To view the activity of each specific core use the “-P ALL” flag.  The following shows a real-time snapshot of the 4 cores in my PC (same intervals and output parameters apply, below is 1 second 1 time):
 
Want to see how much memory is currently being used? Use sar -r as follows to show real-time memory usage every 2 seconds for 10 times:
 
### Display device report
 
To display a device report showing transfers per second (tps) and data read and write stats, showing data in real-time every 2 seconds, for 10 reports, type:
 
Note:
 
- tps = transfers per second
 - Blk_read/s = amount of data read in blocks per second
 - Blk_wrtn/s = amount of data written in blocks per second
 - Blk_read = total blocks read
 - Blk_wrtn = total blocks written

 
For extended I/O stats:
 
### Get information regarding running process
 
Use pidstat to report information regarding running process.  The -d flag will list all processes on the machine:
 
To see real-time results of running processes, you can use the following, where like the above examples, the first number is the second interval and the second number is how many times to report:
 
Another useful command is to use pidstat with the -r flag to analyze memory usage with particular processes:
 
## Conclusion
 
Sysstat is a very powerful monitoring tool for Linux and it is particularly useful in a server environment where there is no GUI available. The above mentioned only touch the surface of what sysstat is capable. If you have used sysstat in your PC/server, feel free to share with us the various ways you use it to monitor your system performance.
