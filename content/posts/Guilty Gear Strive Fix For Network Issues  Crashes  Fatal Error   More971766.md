#Say Goodbye to Guilty Gear Strive Network Nightmare - Simple Fix for Crashes, Fatal Errors, and More!

Guilty Gear Strive is a much-awaited fighting game that has finally launched for console and PC players. The game's content, visuals, and game mechanics are impressive, making it a must-have for fans of the genre. However, with its launch came a slew of network issues that have caused frustration for many players. Some have been unable to connect to the game's servers, while others have experienced crashes and fatal errors.

The good news is that there is a simple fix for these issues. In this article, we'll discuss how to troubleshoot the most common network problems in Guilty Gear Strive.

##Check Your System Requirements##

The first step in troubleshooting any game issue is to ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements for the game. If your computer or console does not meet these requirements, you are likely to experience crashes and lagging.

##Update Your Drivers##

The next step is to update your graphics card and network drivers. This is crucial if you are experiencing crashes and other errors while playing. Outdated drivers can cause performance issues, crashes, and other network-related problems.

##Check Your Internet Connection##

If you are experiencing connectivity issues, the next step is to check your internet connection. You can do this by running an internet speed test. If your internet speed is slow, it could be the root of your connectivity problems. It is also important to make sure that you are connected to the right type of network, which is either through ethernet or Wi-Fi.

##Turn off Background Programs##

Another possible reason for network issues is background programs running on your system. These programs use your computer's resources, causing the game to slow down or crash. To rule out this possibility, turn off all unnecessary programs before starting the game.

##Adjust Your Graphics Settings##

Lastly, lower your graphics settings. This is especially necessary if your graphics card does not meet the game's requirements. By lowering the game's graphics settings, you may experience smoother gameplay, and it may reduce the bandwidth requirements for the game's network connection.

In conclusion, Guilty Gear Strive is a fantastic game, but network issues can ruin the experience for players. However, by following the above steps, you can resolve common network problems in Guilty Gear Strive. Always ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements, update your drivers, check your internet connection, turn off background programs, and adjust your graphics settings. With these steps, you can say goodbye to the Guilty Gear Strive network nightmare and start enjoying the game again.

#### Alternative Solution 1
 
- If this method does not solve the Application Load Error 3:0000065432, your computer’s anti-virus might be obstructing the game from functioning properly.
 - You can get around this hurdle by disabling the anti-virus’ real-time protection feature.

 - While the core of this process is the same for all anti-viruses, the process may differ.
 - If you use Windows Security, head to Settings, then click Update & Security, after which you will have to select Windows Security and then Virus & Threat Protection. Once you’re here, turn off the real-time protection in Manage Settings, located under Virus & Threat Protection.

### GGST LowLevelFatal Error or Fatal Error
 
- If you play Guilty Gear Strive on a PC, you may have noticed the game crashing with a Fatal Error notification. This error usually occurs during launch or while playing the game.
 - The reason behind the LowLevelFatal Error [File: Unknown] [Line: 3934] or Fatal Error might be DirectX.

 - You will have to go to the video settings and verify the resolution scale.
 - If the resolution is set to a number higher than 100%, bring it down to 100% and the game should stop crashing.
 - This is because 100% is your native resolution, so any number higher than it will force your system to render a higher resolution than your display can handle.

 
- Another possible cause of the LowLevelFatal Error or Fatal Error may be your GPU driver.
 - You will have to either update or reinstall your GPU driver to fix the error.

 
#### Alternative Solution 3

 - An overclocked GPU is most likely the cause of such an error occurring. To rectify it, reset your GPU block to its default settings even if the GPU is overclocked from the factory.
