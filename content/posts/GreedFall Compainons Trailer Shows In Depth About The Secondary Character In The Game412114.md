For those who are new to Greedfall, the game is a role-playing adventure set in a unique fantasy world. Your character is a diplomat who travels to a new continent in search of a cure for a deadly disease that is ravaging his homeland. Along the way, you'll meet a range of fascinating characters who will aid or hinder your quest.

Let's take a closer look at some of the secondary characters featured in the new trailer.

## Vasco

Vasco is a member of the Nauts, a seafaring people who have a vested interest in the new continent. He initially appears to be a smooth-talking, easy-going character, but his backstory is anything but. In fact, Vasco is dealing with a dark secret, and his loyalty to his people is called into question.

## Siora

Siora is a member of the native tribe that inhabits the new continent. She's fiercely protective of her people and is initially suspicious of your character. However, as you work together to uncover the truth behind the disease that's affecting both their peoples, you'll learn more about her backstory. Revelations about her past will make you see her in a new light.

## Kurt

Kurt is a soldier who serves as your bodyguard. He's gruff, no-nonsense, and always ready for a fight. However, his backstory is surprisingly tragic. Despite his tough exterior, he's dealing with a lot of emotional pain.

## Aphra

Aphra is a scientist who is working on a cure for the disease that's the central plot of the game. She's brilliant, analytical, and somewhat socially awkward. However, her backstory is shrouded in mystery. Her past is connected to something dark and dangerous, but it's unclear exactly what that is.

## Petrus

Petrus is a member of the Theleme faction, a group of religious zealots who have taken an interest in the new continent. He's a pompous, self-righteous character who thinks he's always right. But his backstory is surprisingly sympathetic. He's dealing with a lot of guilt and shame from his past, and he's trying to make amends for his mistakes.

These are just a few of the secondary characters in Greedfall, and the new trailer promises to reveal even more secrets and twists.
