Are you tired of constantly getting caught with your lethal arsenal in Hitman 3? Do you yearn for a better way to keep your weapons and gear hidden from view? Look no further! In this guide, we'll provide you with the ultimate tips and tricks for hiding your illegal items and maintaining a low profile while you’re on a killing spree.

1. Concealment Opportunities

The world of Hitman 3 is full of opportunities for stealth and concealment. Take advantage of opportunities that are unique to each location, such as hidden rooms or lockers, and hide your illegal items there. Always be on the lookout for opportunities to stash your items and remember where you left them.

2. Disguise Yourself

One of the best ways to remain undetected in Hitman 3 is by disguising yourself as someone else. You can use the costumes of the individuals you've eliminated to blend in and remain anonymous, allowing you to hide your items in plain sight. Please keep in mind that some disguises may be checked more thoroughly than others, so be cautious and strategic when choosing your outfit.

3. Use Briefcases

Carrying your weapons in a briefcase can be an effective way to hide them. Open your inventory, select your desired weapon and then attach it to your briefcase. Walking around with a briefcase can appear suspicious, so avoid carrying it around openly or for long periods. If a security guard or a fellow civilian asks you to hand over the briefcase or check its contents, pass it over and walk away.

4. Find Cabinets or Containers

Another way to hide your items is by placing them in cabinets, containers, or any other storage units available. Be it dumpsters, cabinets, or refrigerators, any surface that can be opened can be used to hide your arsenal. This strategy may take some trial and error to learn which hiding spots are the safest, but it is worth it in the end.

5. Distract Your Enemies

Lastly, you may use distractions to draw away your enemies’ attention. Use items like coins, soda cans, or any other relevant items to create a commotion, then sneakily put your weaponry away while they're looking the other way.

Final Thoughts

In summary, hiding your arsenal in Hitman 3 requires creativity, quick thinking, and a keen eye for opportunities. Employing the tips and tricks outlined in this guide will help keep you out of sight and prevent detection from enemies. So, put on your favorite disguise, pack your weapons in a briefcase, and get ready to take on the world of Hitman 3 with confidence!

If there is an illegal item that you don’t want to retrieve then you can drop them anywhere by pressing down on the D-pad. Make sure to drop the item when there is no guard looking at you. If they spot you dropping illegal items they will attack you.
