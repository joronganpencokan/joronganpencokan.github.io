You Won't Believe This Secret Trick to Merge Allies in Fire Emblem Heroes!

Fire Emblem Heroes is a tactical role-playing game that requires strategic gameplay and careful unit management. One of the crucial elements of the game is the merging of heroes, which allows you to strengthen your characters and make them more powerful in battle. Merging can be a daunting task, but there is a secret trick that can make it much easier.

When it comes to merging allies, the game provides two options. The first option is to merge two allies with the same name and rarity but different levels. This method increases the level cap of the stronger hero and grants them a stat boost. The second option is to merge two allies with the same name and rarity but already at their maximum level. This method grants a stat boost without increasing the level cap.

The secret trick to merging allies is called "inheritance." Inheritance allows you to transfer skills and properties from one ally to another. This means that you can merge multiple copies of the same hero to pass down specific attributes and abilities to a chosen unit.

To make use of this trick, you need to obtain multiple copies of the same character. This can be done through summoning or by acquiring them from special events. Once you have a few copies of the same unit, it's time to start merging.

Choose the unit that you want to keep as your primary character, and choose the most compatible secondary unit to merge. Look at the secondary unit's properties and abilities, and see if there's anything valuable that could be transferred to the primary unit. For example, if the secondary unit has a valuable skill that your primary unit doesn't have, like the ability to heal allies, you might want to merge them.

To merge units using inheritance, select the primary unit and choose the option to inherit skills. Next, choose the secondary unit and select the skill you want to transfer. You can do this as many times as you want, depending on the number of copies you have.

Inheritance is a powerful tool that allows you to create unique and powerful units to use in battle. It gives you more control over your units' development and playstyle. With this trick, merging allies becomes a more exciting and rewarding part of the game.

In conclusion, merging allies in Fire Emblem Heroes can be a challenging and tedious process. However, with the secret trick of inheritance, you can make this task more manageable and enjoyable. By merging compatible units and using the abilities and properties of multiple copies, you can create powerful and unique characters to use in battle. So, start experimenting with inheritance and get ready to join the fight!

Fire Emblem Heroes allows you to merge allies to get better heroes. This is a neat mechanism that lets you take your duplicate heroes and put them to good use. And that use is to enhance the existing hero that you might already be using. So in this guide let us check how to Merge Allies in Fire Emblem Heroes, and learn their effects.
 
## How to Merge Allies in Fire Emblem Heroes
 
Merging Allies in this game is pretty straightforward. You need to have two of the same heroes to merge. Here is its process:
 
- Tap on the Allies button.
 - Next, tap on Advanced Growth.
 - Here tap on Merge Allies.
 - Tap on the Lose slot and then the hero you no longer need to place it there.
 - Similarly, tap on the Enhance slot and then the hero you want to improve to move it there.
 - Click on Next.
 - The game will then give you a warning and information about the benefit you get from merging.
 - Once you are sure click on the Confirm button.
 - This will give you a final popup, to confirm you want to merge tap on Inherit. You get these popups because once you merge the two heroes you lose the hero you placed on the Lose slot.

 
Remember the heroes need to be the same not just their names. So for example you cannot merge Alfonse: Askran Duo with Alfonse: Prince of Askr. But you can merge Alfonse: Prince of Askr with another Alfonse: Prince of Askr. Irrespective of its rarity.
