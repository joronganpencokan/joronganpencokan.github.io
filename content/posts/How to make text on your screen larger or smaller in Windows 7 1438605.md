As we all know, Windows 7 was an iconic operating system that helped shape the future of Microsoft's software suite. And yet, despite its status as a classic, there are still many users who struggle with its customization options. One of the most commonly encountered issues involves adjusting the text size on your screen. Of course, you can change the resolution of your display or the overall DPI, but what if you simply want to make the text larger or smaller? Fret not, as we've got a secret trick that will help you do just that!

## Step By Step Guide

2. From there, click on "Make text and other items larger or smaller."

3. You will then be taken to the "Display" window, where you can select a percentage for text size. However, the default options here are limited, so we'll need to access a special utility that's built into Windows.

5. Select that, and you'll be taken to a more advanced settings window, where you can select precise scaling options for your text.

6. Choose the percentage scaling that works best for you, and hit "Apply."

7. You'll be prompted to sign out and sign back in. Once you do so, you should see your text displayed at the new size you chose.
