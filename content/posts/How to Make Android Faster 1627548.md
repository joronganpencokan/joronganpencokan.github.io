# 20 Simple Tricks To Turn Your Laggy Android Into A Supersonic Speed Machine!

If you are using an old Android device, you might be facing major problems with its speed and performance. Lags, slow app response, and decreased battery life can turn your device into a nightmare. However, there's no need to worry! You don't have to upgrade to a new phone just yet. There are simple tricks that you can do to turn your laggy Android into a super-fast and efficient device. In this article, we will guide you through 20 simple steps to make your Android device truly speedy.

## 1. Choose a Lightweight Launcher

Your home screen is the first layer of your Android device, and the launcher you use can significantly affect your phone's performance. Heavyweight Launchers tend to take longer to load, and they can slow down your device. Choosing a lightweight launcher that suits your preferences can improve the overall speed of your device. Nova Launcher, Lawnchair Launcher, and Apex Launcher are some of the best lightweight launchers for Android.

## 2. Remove Unwanted Apps

The more apps you have installed on your device, the more sluggish it can become. Some apps even run in the background and use up system resources, causing your device to lag. Removing unwanted apps can free up space and improve the performance of your device.

## 3.Disable Animations

Animations can look stunning, but they can also cause your device to lag. Disabling animations can speed up operations such as opening and closing apps, going back to the home screen, and more. To disable animations, go to your device's developer options, and turn off the "Window animation scale" and "Transition animation scale."

## 4. Clear Your Cache

Cache files are temporary files that your device creates to speed up app loading times. Over time, cache files can build up and take up valuable storage space on your device. Clearing your cache can free up space and improve the overall speed of your device.

## 5. Use SD Card for App Storage

If your device allows it, move some apps to your SD card. This will free up storage space on your phone and reduce the load on your device's internal storage. The reduced load can help speed up your Android device.

## 6. Turn Off Auto-Sync

Auto-sync keeps all your apps, contacts, and files up to date but it can be a significant drain on your device's resources. Turning off auto-sync can help reduce the load on your device, making it faster and more efficient.

## 7. Disable Unused Bluetooth and Wi-Fi

Turning on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi can cause your device to slow down due to the increased use of your device's resources. Disabling unused Bluetooth and Wi-Fi can reduce the load on your device, freeing up resources and boosting the speed of your device.

## 8. Uninstall Live Wallpapers

Live wallpapers may look great, but they can put a significant strain on your device's resources, causing it to slow down. Uninstalling live wallpapers can speed up your device and improve its performance.

## 9. Keep Your Device Up To Date

The latest software updates usually come with performance improvements and bug fixes that can help speed up your device. Keeping your device up to date by installing the latest software updates can help improve its speed and performance.

## 10. Use Lite Apps

Lite Apps are optimized versions of regular apps that use fewer resources, storage, and data. Using Lite Apps can improve the speed and performance of your device, especially if you have an older device.

## 11. Disable GPS and Location Services

GPS and location services use a lot of your device's resources to track your device's location. Disabling GPS and location services when you are not using them can reduce the load on your device, improving its speed and performance.

## 12. Clear App Data 

Clearing app data can free up space and improve the speed and performance of your device. To clear app data, go to settings, find the specific app, and select "clear data." This will delete all the app's data, including login credentials, preferences, and other relevant information associated with that app.

## 13. Disable Automatic Brightness

Disabling automatic brightness and manually adjusting the brightness level can help reduce the load on your device, as it avoids the device from constantly adjusting to different environments. This can help improve the overall speed and performance of your device.

## 14. Use A Screen Protector

Using a screen protector can help reduce the chances of unintended taps and gestures, which can slow down your device. By avoiding unnecessary touches, you can speed up the device, increasing its overall performance.

## 15. Disable Background Data Usage

Some apps tend to run in the background and use data, which can slow down your device. Disabling background data usage for specific apps can reduce the load on your device, freeing up resources and improving its overall speed.

## 16. Restrict Background Processes

Some apps tend to run in the background, using device resources that can cause your device to slow down. Restricting background processes for specific apps can help reduce the load on your device, speeding it up and improving its overall performance.

## 17. Use Dark Theme

Using the dark theme can help reduce the strain on your device's battery and hardware, and it can also help reduce the load on your device, improving its speed and performance.

## 18. Reduce Widgets

Widgets can look fantastic, but they can also cause your device to slow down by draining your device's resources. Reducing widgets can help speed up your device by freeing up resources.

## 19. Use A Task Killer App

Task killer apps help terminate tasks and apps running in the background, freeing up memory and boosting speed. However, be careful with using these apps as they can sometimes do more harm than good. We recommend the use of the device's own "Recent" button, which serves the same purpose without the need for additional apps.

## 20. Restart Your Device

Restarting your device can clear out the cache and close any unwanted background apps running, all of which can help improve the speed and performance of your device.

## Conclusion

By following these simple tricks, you can turn your laggy Android device into a speedy device. Improving your device's speed will allow you to enjoy a more seamless and enjoyable experience. Give these tips a try, and let us know in the comments if you have other tips to speed up your Android device!

Android phones have made significant performance gains thanks to improved hardware and constant software updates. It will be difficult to find games and apps for your flagship phone that it cannot handle. Most midrange gadgets are also competent. These days, even cheap Android phones are powerful. However, there are differences between a brand-new device and one that has been used for some time and has a lot of trash files, plenty of installed apps and games, and a battery drain and recharges cycle. Even the fastest Android phones eventually begin to slow down after a couple of years. You can take steps to enhance your phone’s performance. Although it won’t be as quick as the newest flagships, you should still see some performance improvements. Here are our top suggestions on how to make Android faster.
 
## How to Make Android Faster?
 
There are many methods you may use to speed up your Android smartphone. Continue reading to learn how to speed up your phone—as well as what you should not do.
 
### Restart Device
 
Restarting your device should be your first step in troubleshooting if your phone suddenly becomes slow. This easy trick can dramatically improve the performance of your phone, especially if annoying background app activities are to blame. The majority of smartphones are equipped with adequate RAM, and Android has a great memory management system. Nevertheless, a reboot can enhance overall performance if you use a low-cost smartphone with 3GB or 4GB of memory or less.
 

 
Restarting your smartphone at least once a week is a smart idea. However, if it starts to drag in between reboots, up the frequency to once every other day.
 
### Clean Storage
 
If you have an older phone, you’re probably aware of the problem of running out of storage. When your phone is low on storage, everything comes to a halt. Less than 10% of the on-device storage, according to Google, will cause performance concerns. Our recommendation is to maintain the empty storage space at roughly 20%.
 
- Go to Settings.
 - Open Storage Settings or just search for Storage using the Search Bar inside Storage Settings.
 - Take your time to find all the unused Apps and uninstall them.

 
You can also delete all the backed-up photos, delete duplicates and old downloads, and use a microSD card if you have the slot. One of the best apps to clean leftover files from applications is Files by Google.
 
### Uninstall Apps
 
You can take this as an extension of the above suggestion. Unused apps don’t only take up precious storage space but also hog up RAM if they are running in the background. Uninstalling downloaded programs that are no longer in use may enhance device performance and battery life. Apps can be removed in a variety of ways, but the most common method is to long-press the icon and choose Uninstall or drag the icon to the uninstall window that pops up at the top of the screen.
 
If you choose not to remove applications, you can clean the caches for each one separately. On stock Android, choose the app and choose Clear cache by tapping Settings > Storage > Other Apps. Tap Settings > Apps on your Samsung. You can choose an app and hit Storage > Clear cache from here, or you can sort by size. This is less efficient than uninstalling the app because the cache will rebuild. You will need to do this once in a while.
 
### Decrease System Animation Speed
 
Although changing the speed of the system animation on your Android smartphone won’t actually speed things up, it will give the impression that it is working more quickly. This perception of better system performance is the result of shorter animation delays, which hasten the completion of graphics sequences.
 
If the animations on your Android smartphone seem unusually sluggish or slow, try this approach. It almost feels magical. For better outcomes, you can disable the system animations. But in the process, you’ll give up the eye-catching transition effects. You will need to enable Developer Options for this.
 
- Go to Settings.
 - Scroll down to About Phone and tap on it.
 - Tap the Build Number 7 times. Confirm if a prompt appears.
 - Go back to Settings and find the newly unlocked Developer Options.
 - Inside Developer Options, scroll down and find Animation Scale under Drawing
 - Tap on it and select the lowest possible option (.5x) on:
 - Window Animation Scale,
 - Transition Animation Scale, and
 - Animator Duration Scale.

 
### Use Lite Apps
 
For outdated and low-end Android smartphones with less RAM and storage, Google and a few other developers provide Lite or Go variants of their apps. Apps in the Lite edition are smaller and use fewer resources than their full-featured counterparts. A number of Google’s apps, such as Google Go, Assistant Go, & Maps Go, have Lite versions available. On the Play Store, you can also get Lite versions of other well-known applications like Twitter, Spotify, and Facebook.
 
- Window Animation Scale,
 - Transition Animation Scale, and
 - Animator Duration Scale.

 
### Update Firmware
 
Check for the latest updates if your phone seems sluggish. Every time a new version of Android is released, Google optimizes it, and even most producers do the same with their software skins. Therefore, updating to the most recent Android version on your device might free up system resources, which might aid in quicker app loading times and greater system smoothness. Since the early days of Android, all major Manufacturers have advanced significantly and now frequently release updates for their smartphones. The best aspect is that these companies make improvements to system responsiveness and smoothness practically every time there is an update. So, check the system update settings to see if any OTA software is available.
 
Inside the Google Play Store, you may activate automatic updates as well. Apps update automatically if you have Wi-Fi access and your phone is idle. The settings can be changed to permit updates over mobile data, but if you go over your monthly data allotment, your service provider might impose extra fees or reduce your internet speed.
 
### Install Custom Firmware
 
Consider implementing a custom Firmware or kernel on your Android phone if it is an older (and slower) model or has outlived manufacturer support. Your warranty will be voided as a result, however, given how old your gadget is, it has essentially already expired. Make sure your device’s bootloader can be unlocked before continuing because you’re probably out of luck otherwise. The process to root and install custom ROMs or kernels differ based on the version and device maker on phones when the bootloader unlocking is not a problem.
 
If you don’t like the stock firmware on your phone, flashing a custom ROM is an excellent choice. The extra software and features that many manufacturers add to their products cause them to become bloated, problematic, and slow. You may immediately increase your speed by switching to a clutter ROM like LineageOS in its place.
 
## What Doesn’t Work?
 
Task Killers do not work. The most widely used apps on the Play Store are task killers, however, they are absolutely useless. In fact, they might slow down your phone. To release RAM, a task killer shuts down background programs. It operates under the premise that extra RAM enhances performance, yet this is untrue. Android is made to maintain apps in RAM so that it can instantly restore them. When more resources are required, it will automatically close apps. The fact that some app processes are made to operate in the background means that they will, more importantly, restart immediately after being stopped. Your phone will run much slower if you stop pausing and starting so much than if you simply allow Android to do its thing.
 
Other useless apps are “Speed Optimizers” that does not require root access. While we make every effort to avoid stereotypes, it is safe to state that you should stay away from any non-root application that claims to boost your phone’s performance. This includes SD card speedups, RAM boosters, and other tools of a similar nature that you may get on the Google Play Store. They don’t function quite often, are generally loaded with unwanted adverts, and might actually slow down your phone.
 
Additionally, avoid using Android defragmenter apps. Defragmenting is not necessary for your phone because it uses flash memory and is unaffected by fragmentation. Your phone won’t operate quicker even if you use every phone defragmenter available on Google Play. At best, they won’t do anything, and at worst, they might be malicious apps.
