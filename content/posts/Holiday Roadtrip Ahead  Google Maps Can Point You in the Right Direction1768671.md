# Hit the Road with Google Maps: The Must-Have Tool for Your Next Epic Holiday Road Trip!

Are you planning an epic holiday road trip? Exploring new and exciting places with your friends or family could be one of the best feelings in the world. But to ensure your trip is a success, you need the right tool in your arsenal – Google Maps! 

Google Maps is not just any maps app – it’s a powerful tool that can make your holiday road trip hassle-free and enjoyable. From finding the best routes to pinpointing nearby landmarks and attractions, Google Maps has everything you need to make your trip a success. Here’s how:

## Real-Time Traffic Updates

One of the biggest issues when travelling on a road trip is encountering traffic. It can slow you down and affect your planned schedule. Google Maps provides real-time traffic updates that help you avoid congestion and take a detour. With this feature, you don't have to worry about getting stuck in traffic.

## Find Hotels, Restaurants and Gas Stations 

Your holiday road trip would be incomplete without good food and a comfortable place to rest. With Google Maps, you can locate nearby hotels, restaurants, and gas stations. You can also check reviews and ratings of these locations to help you make a decision. 

## Offline Maps

Travelling to remote locations may limit your connectivity. But with Google Maps, you can download maps for offline use. These maps can be accessed when you're offline, and you won't have to worry about losing your way.

## Plan Your Road Trip Itinerary 

The key to a successful road trip is to have a well-planned itinerary. With Google Maps, you can plan your route beforehand and add multiple stops along the way. This feature ensures that you make the most of your trip and don't miss any must-see places.

## Street View

Google Maps also offers a Street View feature that allows you to have a virtual tour of your destination before you get there. It lets you explore the area even before you set foot in the place.

## Custom Maps

Google Maps allows you to create custom maps tailored to your road trip. You can add multiple destinations to it, giving you a clear idea of the trip's route. You can also share these custom maps with your friends and family travelling with you.

Conclusion

In a nutshell, Google Maps is an indispensable tool for your epic holiday road trip. It provides real-time traffic updates, shows landmarks and attractions, locates hotels, restaurants and gas stations, offline maps, street view, and lets you plan your itinerary. This makes it easier to navigate, saving you time and reducing stress. So next time you're planning a road trip, make sure Google Maps is on your checklist!

A trio of updates for Google Maps should make your road trips easier, no matter where in the world you may be visiting.

 

It's getting to be that time of year again when we travel around the state, country, or even world to hang out with friends and family—and Google Maps' latest updates can help with that. Granted, a couple of these features aren't new, but they are being made available in more areas.

 

The augmented Street View feature, Live View, is extending availability to six new cities, allowing you to look through your camera to find marked points of interest. Now, whenever you're in London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, San Francisco, or Tokyo, you can turn it on and move your phone around to find the shops, restaurants, etc., that you're looking for.

 

Searches for electric vehicle (EV) charging are also getting beefed up with a new "fast charge" filter, so you can weed out stations with less than 50kW outputs. On top of that, more countries will support plug-type filters to make sure you get results that are compatible with your car.

 

Accessible Places adds wheelchair accessibility to location search filters and has only been available in Australia, Japan, the UK, and the US—but now it's going global. Once it's turned on in Google Maps, your search results will also include either a wheelchair icon (accessible) or a wheelchair icon that's crossed out (inaccessible). Further details also cover whether or not a building has accessible seating, restrooms, or parking.

 

Live View's expansion into more regions kicks off sometime next week for both Android and iOS. While advanced EV search options and Accessible Places are available now worldwide, EV searches are limited to countries where charging stations are available.
