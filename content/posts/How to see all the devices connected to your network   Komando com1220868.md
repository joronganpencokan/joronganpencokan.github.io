As businesses continue to become more reliant on technology, the number of network devices within a company continues to rise. While these devices improve efficiency and productivity, they can also be a gateway for cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to crucial information.

One of the biggest challenges facing IT teams is identifying all the devices within a network, including those that are not easily recognized. These include devices that may not be centrally managed, such as an employee's personal mobile device or a rogue machine plugged into a network port.

When it comes to network security, the elements that you can't see can often be the most dangerous. This is why it's essential to be able to detect sneaky devices hiding within your network. In this article, we will explore the different types of devices that can hide within your network and how to detect them.

### Types of Sneaky Devices

There are various types of sneaky devices that can infiltrate your network without your IT team's knowledge. These include the following:

#### Rogue devices

Rogue devices are unauthorized devices that access the network. They may include devices such as wireless access points, gaming devices or other connected peripherals that have been added to the network without proper authorization.

#### Compromised devices

Compromised devices are those that have been compromised by malware or other malicious software. These devices can be used by cybercriminals to infiltrate the network, extract data, and cause damages.

#### Unmanaged devices

Unmanaged devices are employee-owned devices or other devices that may not be centrally managed, such as IoT devices or USB drives. These devices are difficult to track, but they can pose a significant security risk to your network.

### How to Detect Sneaky Devices

Detecting sneaky devices can be challenging, but there are a few steps you can take to increase your chances of finding them before they can do any damage.

#### Use network scanning tools

Network scanning tools can help you identify devices that are connected to your network. These tools will give you a comprehensive list of all the devices connected to your network, including IP addresses and device names.

#### Conduct regular network audits

Conducting regular network audits can help you identify unauthorized devices connected to your network. You can conduct these audits using network scanning tools or by physically inspecting devices connected to your network.

#### Implement network segmentation

Implementing network segmentation can help you isolate devices that are not authorized to access certain areas of your network. By restricting access, you can prevent unauthorized devices from accessing sensitive information.

#### Train employees on network security

Educating employees on the importance of network security can reduce the risk of unauthorized devices being connected to the network. Train employees on the risks of using unapproved devices and how to recognize potential cybersecurity threats.

### Conclusion

As technology continues to advance, the number of network devices within organizations will increase, and so will the risk of unauthorized access to crucial information. It's crucial to detect and remove sneaky devices that are hiding in your network to ensure that your organization's information remains secure.

By using network scanning tools, conducting regular network audits, implementing network segmentation, and training employees on network security, you can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your organization's sensitive information.

However, you may begin to lose track of everything that’s connected, or worse, notice things that don’t belong. There may even be users who have tried to connect to your Wi-Fi network without your permission or knowledge.
This is bad news for a few reasons. Someone could be stealing your network bandwidth — or your personal information. Luckily, there are simple ways to determine which devices are connected to your network, and you can prune what should and shouldn’t be there.

 
## Use your router’s online interface


This is a relatively simple (and free) way to get an idea of who’s using your network. Log into your router to see the most up-to-date information about which devices are connected. Most models will support this as it’s a pretty universal feature.
First, you’ll need your computer’s IP address. Tap or click here to learn how to find it.
Once you have it, type the IP address into your browser’s address bar. You should be brought to your router’s menu. You’ll need to log in with the custom username and password for your router, or the default information if you never set one.
Once you’re in, check for a list that says DHCP Client or Connected Devices. From there, you’ll be met with a list of devices currently using your network. If you see something you don’t recognize, change your Wi-Fi password and reconnect only the devices you trust. It’s a pretty lengthy process, but one worth doing.

 
## Use Advanced IP Scanner


If you don’t feel comfortable digging into your network, you can always have an app to do it for you. Tap or click here to learn how to use Advanced IP Scanner.
Advanced IP Scanner is a free and reliable option that delivers swift results with very little input from you. It’s compatible with Windows 10.
To use Advanced IP Scanner, all you need to do is download and install it, then run the program to analyze your wireless network. Just click the large green button that says SCAN. It will commence a network scan to show you all the devices currently connected to your Wi-Fi.
It should only take a few seconds, and you can even export your results for safekeeping. This is a great method for anyone less comfortable with tech, especially since it’s fast and easy.

 
## Use Acrylic Wi-Fi Professional


If you’re looking for something with a lot more oomph, try Acrylic’s Wi-Fi Professional app. You can choose between the free and paid options, and it does a lot more than just allow you to see what devices are on your Wi-Fi network.
The free version gives you information on up to five devices, while the paid version gives you info for unlimited devices. It can also help monitor traffic on your network, manage passwords and much, much more. This would be a fantastic business solution, or a realistic option for anyone with multiple networks.
Now, it may be high time to consider hiding your wireless network from your neighbors – and all the strangers who might be snooping around. Tap or click here to learn how to hide your wireless network from others. Being more aware of who’s using your network is an important step forward for your internet speed and privacy – and we could all be a lot more vigilant about that.
