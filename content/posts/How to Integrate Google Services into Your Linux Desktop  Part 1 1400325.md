TITLE: You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Bring Google to Your Linux Desktop - Step by Step Guide Inside!

INTRODUCTION:

Google is undoubtedly one of the most popular search engines in the world, and for a good reason. It provides reliable, relevant, and lightning-fast search results, making it the go-to platform of choice for internet users worldwide. Unfortunately, not all Linux users can easily access the Google search engine from their desktop, which is frustrating, to say the least. But worry no more! In this article, we'll show you step-by-step how you can bring Google to your Linux desktop easily.

BODY:

Step 1: Installing the Chromium Browser

Before you can access Google, you need a browser that can connect to the internet. Fortunately, Linux has several browser options to choose from, and the Chromium browser is an excellent choice. To install Chromium on your Linux desktop, you can use this command on your terminal:

sudo apt-get install chromium-browser

Once the installation is complete, you can launch Chromium from your desktop search bar and proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Adding Google as Your Default Search Engine

Now that you have a browser installed on your Linux desktop, it's time to add Google as your default search engine. Follow the steps below:

- Launch Chromium and click on the three dots menu on the top right-hand corner.
- Select 'Settings' and scroll down to the 'Search Engine' section.
- Under 'Search Engine,' click on the dropdown menu and select 'Google.'
- Click 'Manage search engines' and move Google to the top of the list.
- Close the settings tab, and you're good to go!

Step 3: Customize Your Search Settings

Google provides many customization options to personalize your search experience, and you can access these options by following the steps below:

- Launch Chromium and go to the Google homepage.
- Click on the 'Settings' menu on the bottom right-hand corner.
- Click on 'Search Settings' and choose your preferred options.
- Click 'Save' to apply your settings.

Step 4: Add a Google Search Bar to Your Desktop

If you prefer to have quick access to Google directly from your desktop, you can add a Google search bar to your panel. Here's how:

- Right-click on your panel and select 'Add Widgets.'
- Search for 'Google Search Bar.'
- Drag and drop the widget to your panel, and you're done!

CONCLUSION:

In conclusion, accessing Google from your Linux desktop doesn't have to be complicated. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily add Google as your default search engine, customize your search settings, and add a Google search bar to your panel for quicker access. With Google now at your fingertips, you can surf the web effortlessly and efficiently, all from the comfort of your Linux desktop.

Google is (or was, depending on who you ask) a favorite among free software lovers because of their tendency to “don’t be evil.” Whether you feel that way or not, the company still offers some pretty great services, easily accessible via a web browser (and particularly good if accessed via Google’s own Chrome).

Maybe I’m in the minority, but I like “fat client” programs. All other things being equal, I’d rather get my e-mail in Thunderbird, download and RSS feeds in a reader, and edit documents in LibreOffice. Google is quite good about letting these types of programs access their services, and while instructions to do so are plentiful for Windows- and Mac-based programs, it takes a little more to find them for Linux. This guide will show you how to hook up the programs on your Ubuntu desktop to the variety of Google web apps, for the nice, Linux-y experience we’re all looking for.
 
## Personal Data
 
The “big four” of personal data – schedules, tasks, contacts, and e-mail – are hosted in Google Calendar (for the former two) and GMail (for the latter two). Access to these is fairly open, and easy to tap with default or installable applications from the Ubuntu Software Centre:
 
### Calendar
 
In a stock Ubuntu install (starting with Precise), there is no standard calendar component installed (I assume that they assume that you’ll be using a web-based calendar), but you do get Thunderbird. Add to Thunderbird the Lightning extension or, if you like a separate calendar application, install Sunbird. Then add to that the Google Provider, enter your Google credentials, and you’ll be able to add, edit, delete appointments on your Google calendar.
 

 
### Tasks
 
Google Tasks has long been a neglected feature of Google Calendar, rather than the awesome productivity tool Google could certainly make it to be. Although there are a number of Android apps taking advantage of the available API, there aren’t yet any stable Linux apps that do so. But Getting Things GNOME is working to add Google Tasks as one of the many services you can use to store and retrieve task information.
 
### E-mail
 
Thunderbird is the default e-mail client on Ubuntu systems beginning with the current 12.04 version, and it will ably handle your GMail via either POP3 (i.e. downloading your mail to your local machine) or IMAP (synchronizing a local copy of your mail with the server). With all the devices (iPhones, Android tablets, notebooks, etc…) most people have, there’s little reason not to take advantage of power of IMAP, and have your mail whichever you happen to be using.
 
In Thunderbird, setting up Gmail is very easy. Under the “Add Mail Account” settings, you just have to enter your Name, Email Address and Password and it will do the rest of the configuration for you.
 
### Contacts
 
Unlike the Lightning extension for calendars, Thunderbird comes out of the box with a capable address book. Install the Google Contacts Provider, enter your credentials, and you’re off and running.  Once you do so, as shown in the figures below, your Google contacts will show up as an Address Book in Thunderbird.
 
Google is a big fan of Linux. While their development of desktop applications still favors Windows and Mac, they’ve at least created gateways for us Linux lovers to get our Google on! In the next installment, we’ll get files (including documents, music, and pictures) linked up with Google as well.
