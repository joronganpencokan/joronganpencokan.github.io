Title: You Won't Believe Where the Secret Helicopter Location Is in Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 2!

Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 2 is here, and players are already discovering new hidden secrets meant to help them gain an advantage over their opponents. One of these is the secret helicopter location- a coveted asset that can help players traverse across the map quickly and efficiently.

Are you tired of constantly running across the map for minutes at a time, only to find yourself still far away from where you need to be? Fear not, for a solution has been discovered.

The secret helicopter can be found in a location that is not easy to navigate to, requiring a bit of parkour skills and risk-taking. The helicopter is located on the edge of the map, in a small island far beyond the Authority building. It's not marked on the map, but keen players can spot the helipad and the helicopter from afar.

To reach the helicopter, players must first navigate to a hill behind the Authority building, which is to the east of the map. From there, they must carefully slide down the hill towards a river below. The river lays out a path leading to the small island. However, players must jump off the waterfall into the river and then swim to the island carefully. This requires caution, as the player can't afford to take any fall damage from the long drop.

Once on the island, players will find themselves in front of the secret helipad. Beware of the guards who will attempt to stop players from accessing the helicopter. Players must eliminate the guards first before entering the helicopter.

As soon as the player enters the helicopter, they will instantly notice that it has limited fuel, so they will have a certain amount of time to use it. With this in mind, players must use the helicopter wisely and strategically. It is a great tool for quick escapes or to reach places that are hard to get to by foot.

The secret helicopter location is definitely worth the chase, as it helps players get ahead of their opponents in terms of the game's strategy. It may not have unlimited fuel, but it will make traveling on the map easier and smoother. 

What are you waiting for? Grab your friends and try to locate the secret helicopter location to give yourselves a fighting chance to win this season of Fortnite!
