# Unlock the Secret to Creating Engaging Discord Conversations with This Simple Polling Trick!

Discord has become a popular platform for gamers, communities, and businesses to connect with each other. With its interactive features, it allows users to engage in conversations, share ideas and build communities. But how do you keep the conversation interesting and engaging? The answer is simple - use polls! In this article, we'll look at how you can create engaging Discord conversations with this simple polling trick.

## Step 1: Choose a Topic

The first step in creating an engaging Discord conversation is to choose a topic that is relevant and interesting to your audience. It could be anything from the latest game release to the most recent social media trend. Once you have your topic, you can move on to the next step.

## Step 2: Create the Poll

To create a poll in Discord, you need to use a bot. There are plenty of bots available on the internet, but we recommend using Poll Bot. This bot allows you to create simple and multiple-choice polls that are easy to use.

To create a poll using Poll Bot, follow these simple steps:

- Invite Poll Bot to your server by clicking on this [link](https://top.gg/bot/245492977212821504).
- Type !poll followed by your question in the Discord channel you want to create the poll in. For example, !poll Which is your favorite gaming console?
- Poll Bot will give you a link that you can share with your audience. Your audience can then click on the link and participate in the poll.

## Step 3: Get the Conversation Going

Once you have created the poll, you can start the conversation. You can encourage your audience to participate in the poll by sharing the link in the Discord channel. You can also ask them to share their thoughts and opinions about the topic.

As the conversation progresses, you can share the results of the poll in real-time. This will keep your audience engaged and interested in the conversation.

## Step 4: Analyze the Results

After the poll is over, you can analyze the results to see what your audience thinks about the topic. You can use the insights to create more engaging content or to start a new conversation.

## Conclusion

Polling is an easy and effective way to create engaging Discord conversations. By following these simple steps, you can create polls that will keep your audience interested and engaged in the conversation. So, go ahead and give it a try!

Discord is a massive social platform where people from different communities can get together. It is used majorly by Gamers as it is easy to use and is compatible with Gaming but it is not exclusive to Gaming. Anyone can pick up and use Discord as it is very customizable to the user’s needs. One feature that is frequently used and present on many Social Platforms is the ability to make Polls. Now, by default, you cannot make a Poll in Discord but it is possible. In today’s guide, I will show you how to make a Poll on a Discord Server.
 
## How to Make a Poll on Discord
 

 
Before we can start making them, we will have to understand what is a Poll in a Discord Server. Unlike other Chatting Apps, Polls is not a built-in feature of Discord. So we will be using Reactions as our Poll making method. There are a few ways you can make a Poll in Discord.
 
### Poll Channel in a Server
 
In your Discord Server, you can create a Text Channel that will be dedicated to Polls only. Here only you or your Mods/Admins have the rights to create a Poll. First, create a fresh Text Channel. In that Text Channel, set the permissions of Send Messages & Add Reactions to False. This will control any shenanigans within the Channel. Set this to all of the Roles that will be partaking in the Polls of your Discord Server. Now, just write a message and add a few Reactions like demonstrated in the image above. That’s how you can make a Poll in Discord.
 
You can also use Webhooks to make your Polls look nicer but it will be extra work. Since you are the one making the Poll, the looks and aesthetics are all in your control.
 
### Poll Bots
 
Another way to make them in Discord is by using Bots. There are many Bots you can find and use like EasyPoll, Simple Poll, etc. All you have to do is invite these bots into your Discord Server and give them the proper Permissions. Once that is set up, you will have to just type in the respective command and the Bot will make a Poll very easily.
 
These were the ways on how you can make a Poll in Discord. Hopefully, this guide has helped you. You can also check our guides on Getting Discord on the Oculus Quest 2 and Discord PFP Ideas.
