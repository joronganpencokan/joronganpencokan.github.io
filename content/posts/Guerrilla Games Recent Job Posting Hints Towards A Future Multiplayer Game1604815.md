# Guerrilla Games Drops Epic Clue About Their Next Multiplayer Game - Get Ready to Dominate the Virtual Battlefield!

Guerrilla Games, the developers behind the critically acclaimed Horizon Zero Dawn, have recently dropped a hint about their upcoming multiplayer game. The studio released a job listing on their website, seeking a Senior Multiplayer Game Designer who would help develop "a new multiplayer game". This is exciting news for fans of Horizon Zero Dawn, and for gamers who love multiplayer games. 

The job posting did not reveal much about the game, but it did mention that Guerrilla is looking for a Senior Multiplayer Game Designer "with a background in developing competitive multiplayer games". This suggests that the game will be focused on multiplayer gameplay and will be competitive in nature. The job posting also mentions that the new Designer will work closely with the game director and lead designer to create and iterate on the game's design, mechanics, and systems. 

What could Guerrilla's new multiplayer game be? Speculations have been floating around, with some fans hoping for a battle royale game set in the Horizon Zero Dawn universe, while others believe the game will be a team-based shooter. Whatever it is, Guerrilla's impressive portfolio of games gives fans hope that whatever they are working on will deliver. 

Guerrilla Games has been focused on developing single-player games for the past decade, with Horizon Zero Dawn being their latest release. Their shift towards multiplayer gaming is interesting, but it is not unprecedented. Many single-player game developers have ventured into multiplayer gaming with great success in recent years, with examples such as Naughty Dog's The Last of Us and Insomniac Games' Spider-Man: Miles Morales having successful multiplayer modes. 

Guerrilla Games has not announced a release date for the new game, but fans can rest assured that they will be developing a game that they believe in. Endless exciting, multiplayer possibilities await in the gaming world, and Guerrilla Games will be a part of that, solidifying their name as one of the best in the gaming industry. 

Get ready to dominate the virtual battlefield, fans. With Guerrilla Games' new multiplayer game on the horizon, there's a whole new world of gameplay just waiting for players to jump into.

Guerrilla Games have carved up a reputation for themselves for delivering amazing titles like Horizon Zero Dawn and the Killzone franchise.
 
Rumors are afloat of Killzone 5 being in the works because there was huge news last year that the studio could be working on a game with a multiplayer mode and they even went ahead and hired Rainbow Six Siege developers for an unannounced project.
 
Now, the studio has taken the rumor mill by storm by posting a job vacancy which hints towards a multiplayer game being in the works.
 
The list of requirements for the job are listed below
 
## What Will You Do
 
- You will build a robust backend that can scale up to serve many concurrent users
 - You will work on systems like matchmaking, tournaments, clans, and leaderboards
 - You will cooperate with game designers to achieve the vision for the game
 - You will work on systems to test and deploy a new server set without downtime
 - You will integrate the game servers with the PlayStation Network and other third-party service
 - You will keep up to date with the Java world and introduce new technologies when they are relevant for Guerrilla
 - If you are comfortable with C++, you can help integrate the back end services in the game client
 - Though nothing seems to be certain as of this moment exactly what the studio is working on it heavily orientates towards Killzone 5 being developed unless the studio is thinking about making Horizon Zero Dawn sequel with the multiplayer mode in it.
