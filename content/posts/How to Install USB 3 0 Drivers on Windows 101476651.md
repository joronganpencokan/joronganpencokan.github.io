# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Supercharge Your USB with Windows 10

Are you tired of waiting hours for your USB to transfer files? If so, it's time to upgrade your USB to make it supercharged. With Windows 10, you can easily speed up your USB transfer rates by enabling a feature called "Better performance."

When you plug in a USB drive, Windows 10 will by default choose the "Quick removal" option, which means you can safely unplug the drive at any time without first using the "eject" function. This is a convenient option, but it means that Windows is sacrificing performance for safety reasons.

Enabling "Better performance" makes your USB work more efficiently, but you must first make a couple of changes in the system settings. Here's how to do it:

1. Insert your USB drive into your computer.
2. Press the Windows key + E to open File Explorer.
3. Right-click on your USB drive in the file explorer, and select "Properties."
4. Click on the "Hardware" tab, then select your USB drive and click "Properties" again.
5. Click on "Change settings," then click on the "Policies" tab.
6. Check the box next to "Better performance," then click "OK."

Now, your USB drive is optimized for better performance. Windows will use write caching to make transfers faster, but you must first use the "Safely Remove Hardware" function before unplugging your USB to avoid data loss.

Whether it's transferring large files, making a backup copy of important data, or even running an operating system from it, having a supercharged USB can make life easier. Give it a try and see the difference for yourself!

##   How to Install USB 3.0 Drivers on Windows 10  
 

The most likely problem with USB 3.0 drivers on Windows 10 is they've been corrupted somehow. Here's how to reinstall them to make sure they're working as intended.

 
It's always worth double-checking the USB port you’re trying to use is USB 3.0 and not 2.0. While that shouldn't stop you from using it, if your concern is slow speeds, you may be using an older port. USB 3.0 ports tend to be blue, while USB 2.0 tends to be white or black.
 
- Search for Device Manager in the Windows 10 search bar and select the corresponding result.
 - Scroll down the list of hardware and select Universal Serial Bus controllers.
 - Look down the drop-down list, right-click (or tap and hold) USB Root Hub (USB 3.0), and then select Uninstall Device.
 - If you have duplicates, uninstall them all one at a time.
 - Confirm the action, if required to do so, then reboot your device. Windows 10 should reinstall the USB driver automatically upon reboot.

 
##   Re-Install the Specific Device  
 

If you're having trouble with one particular USB 3.0 device, you can try reinstalling the drivers just for that. Follow the steps above to access the Device Manager, then plug in the device you're experiencing driver difficulties with. It should appear in the USB list. Repeat the steps in the previous section to uninstall its drivers, then reboot your system as before.

 

Search for Device Manager in the Windows 10 search bar and select the corresponding result.

 

Scroll down the list of hardware and select Universal Serial Bus controllers.

 

Look down the drop-down list, right-click (or tap and hold) USB Root Hub (USB 3.0), and then select Uninstall Device.

 
If you have duplicates, uninstall them all one at a time.
 

Confirm the action, if required to do so, then reboot your device. Windows 10 should reinstall the USB driver automatically upon reboot.

 
- Access the Device Manager as in the first step above.
 - Right-click (or tap and hold) USB Root Hub (USB 3.0) and select Properties.
 - Select the Driver tab, then select Update Driver.
 - Select Browse my computer for driver software > Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer.
 - Select USB Root Hub (USB 3.0), then select Next. The installation may take a minute, but once complete you'll want to restart your system to finalize the change.

 
###   Using Microsoft's USB Diagnosis Tool  
 

Microsoft has a tool specifically designed for fixing problems with USB 3.0 devices and drivers. Download it from the official support website, then run the program as you would any other. It will attempt to diagnose your USB 3.0 problem. If one is discovered, allow it to continue with an attempted fix. You may need to restart your device after completing it.

 

Access the Device Manager as in the first step above.

 

Right-click (or tap and hold) USB Root Hub (USB 3.0) and select Properties.

 

Select the Driver tab, then select Update Driver.

 

Select Browse my computer for driver software > Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer. 

 

Select USB Root Hub (USB 3.0), then select Next. The installation may take a minute, but once complete you'll want to restart your system to finalize the change.

 
###   Update Your System Drivers  
 

Although Windows 10 should have the USB 3.0 drivers you need to use your compatible devices, it may be some other drivers are too out of date to work properly. To update them, you need to know the name and model of your system or device. If you want to be specific, know the motherboard make and model, too.

 

You can find these using a free system information tool. Once you have them, go to your system or motherboard manufacturer's website and download the latest chipset drivers for your system. Install them as you would any other driver and restart your system.

 
###   Update Windows  
 

Updating Windows itself can sometimes fix problematic issues that just won't seem to go away. The latest Windows service packs and updates can fix a myriad of issues, as they're continually improved and tweaked by Microsoft.

 
##   How to Change Windows 10 USB Power Settings  
 

If none of the above fixes sorted out your particular problem with USB 3.0 on Windows 10, you can try changing Windows' power settings, as they may be interfering with the USB ports and connected devices.

 
- Search for Device Manager using the Windows 10 search bar, and select the corresponding result.
 - Select Universal Serial Bus controllers to expand the section and then right-click (or tap and hold) USB Root Hub (USB 3.0). Select Properties.
 - Choose the Power Management tab and select Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power to disable it.
 - Select OK. If prompted, restart your device.

 
##   Why Isn't USB 3.0 Driver on Windows 10 Working?  
 

Like wired and wireless networking drivers, USB 3.0 drivers are a staple of any Windows 10 installation and should be present and correct when you switch to the operating system for the first time. However, upgrades to Windows 10 from Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, as well as updates to the latest version of Windows, can sometimes cause conflicts with drivers and cause USB 3.0 devices to stop working as they should.

 

Search for Device Manager using the Windows 10 search bar, and select the corresponding result.

 

Select Universal Serial Bus controllers to expand the section and then right-click (or tap and hold) USB Root Hub (USB 3.0). Select Properties.

 

Choose the Power Management tab and select Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power to disable it.

 

Select OK. If prompted, restart your device.
