# 5 Foolproof Ways to Easily Identify and Avoid Scam Calls - Don't Fall Victim to Phone Fraud!

Scam calls are becoming a widespread problem in today's technology-driven world. Fraudsters and scammers use advanced techniques to deceive, manipulate, and trick unsuspecting people into giving away their personal information, financial details, and, in some cases, even their life savings. Scam calls can be intimidating, persuasive, and emotionally charged, making them difficult to detect and avoid. However, with a little bit of knowledge and awareness, you can easily identify and avoid scam calls. In this article, we will discuss five foolproof ways to help you prevent phone fraud.

## Tip 1: Know the Common Types of Scam Calls

The first step to identifying scam calls is to know the common types of scams. Some of the most prevalent types of scam calls include:

- IRS scams
- Tech support scams
- Lottery or sweepstakes scams
- Charity scams
- Social Security scams
- Romance scams

The goal of these scams is to extort money, steal personal information, or install malware on your device. Knowing these scams can help you identify and avoid them.

## Tip 2: Be Cautious of Unsolicited Calls

Scammers often use unsolicited calls to deceive people. Therefore, it's essential to be cautious of any unsolicited calls you receive. Scammers usually pretend to represent a reputable company or authority, such as a bank, government agency, or popular retailer. To verify the legitimacy of the call, you can hang up and call the company's official number to confirm the call's authenticity.

## Tip 3: Don't Share Personal Information

Scammers often ask for personal information, such as your social security number, credit card details, or address, to steal your identity or commit financial fraud. You should never share your personal information with anyone over the phone unless you are sure about their identity.

## Tip 4: Don't Make Payments Over the Phone

Another common scamming technique is to ask for payment over the phone. Scammers may pose as representatives from credit card companies, banks, or the IRS and ask for payment to avoid legal trouble or a negative impact on your credit score. You should never make payments over the phone unless you are 100% sure that the call is genuine.

## Tip 5: Use Call Filtering and Blocking Services

Call filtering and blocking services are available on most smartphones and can help you avoid scam calls. You can use these services to block calls from suspected scammers and to filter out spam calls. You can also download third-party apps that can identify scam calls automatically and alert you to potential fraud.

The Bottom Line

Scam calls are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect. Therefore, it's essential to know the common types of scams, be cautious of unsolicited calls, not share personal information, avoid making payments over the phone, and use call filtering and blocking services to prevent phone fraud. By following these five foolproof tips, you can stay safe and prevent scammers from taking advantage of you over the phone. Stay vigilant and don't let scammers prey on your vulnerability.

## How to know if it is a spam call
 
Truecaller
 
You have probably already heard of this app. Truecaller is the best spam call detector, caller id and dialer app for android. It does its job efficiently and the UI is quite minimalistic. This app can be a great alternative for your dull stock dialer. Apart from the dialer, it also comes up with a fully loaded phone book, contact list and many other features that you may not find in a stock dialer. The major feature is its ability to detect spam call. Truedialer can detect spam calls even if your device is not connected to the internet. But, internet connection is recommended if you want to get accurate results. I’ve been using this app myself for some time now, and I got to say this app is simply the best
 
Mr. Number
 
Is Truecaller is too mainstream for you, Mr. Number is another great app for detecting and blocking spam calls. This app offer tons of cool features along with a sleek interface. With this app, you can block calls, text messages of those annoying telemarketers along with other spam calls and messages. Mr. Number can intercept calls from unknown numbers and hang up automatically. However, it doesn’t block text messages on newer versions of Android. This may not be a problem later.

CallApp looks pretty and works perfectly. This app can block spam calls and marketers with ease. Its database contains billions of numbers and is accurate when it comes to identifying spammers. Should I Answer is another such app that blocks spam number and gives you the rating of the caller’s number. With its offline database, this app is effective even without internet connection.
