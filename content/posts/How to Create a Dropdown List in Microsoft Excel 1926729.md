Revolutionize Your Excel Game with this Simple Dropdown List Trick!

Excel is an incredibly powerful program that has become a staple for businesses and individuals alike; however, many users find it challenging to navigate and utilize all its features. If you're someone who struggles with Excel, there's a simple trick you can use to make your experience more productive and efficient: dropdown lists.

Dropdown lists are an amazing feature in Excel that can save you time and increase accuracy when entering data. Instead of manually typing out each entry into your worksheet, you can create a list and select from pre-existing options. This feature can be particularly useful if you're working with long lists or if you want to maintain consistency in your data.

Creating a Dropdown List in Excel

To create a dropdown list in Excel, follow these simple steps:

1. Start by selecting the cell where you want the dropdown list to appear.

2. On the Excel ribbon, click on the Data tab.

3. Find the Data Validation icon and click on it.

4. In the resulting window, select "List" as the type of validation.

5. In the "Source" field, enter the range of cells that contain the entries you want to include in the dropdown list. Make sure to include any headers or titles you want to appear in the list.

6. Click "OK."

Using a Dropdown List in Excel

Once your dropdown list is set up, using it is incredibly easy. Simply click on the cell with the list, and a dropdown arrow will appear. Click the arrow, and your list will appear. From there, select the desired option, and your selection will appear in the cell.

Benefits of Dropdown Lists

Dropdown lists are a simple yet powerful tool that can bring a myriad of benefits to your Excel workflow. Here are just a few of the ways dropdown lists can revolutionize your Excel game:

1. Increased accuracy: Dropdown lists can help prevent typos and inconsistencies in your data. This can be especially useful in situations where the same data is being entered by multiple people.

2. Time-saving: Entering data manually can be a time-consuming process. Dropdown lists can help speed up data entry by eliminating the need for typing entries.

3. Consistency: Dropdown lists ensure that data is entered consistently throughout your worksheet. This can make it easier to read and understand your data.

Final Thoughts

Dropdown lists may seem like a small, insignificant feature, but they can make a huge difference in your Excel workflow. By increasing accuracy and saving time, dropdown lists can help you take your Excel game to the next level. So why not give it a try?

Creating a dropdown list in your Excel spreadsheet can help to increase the efficiency of your work. This might come in handy, especially when you want your coworkers to provide certain information that may be relevant to the company. By using an Excel dropdown list, you can control exactly what can be entered into a cell by giving the users an option to select from a pre-defined list.
 
When you add a dropdown list to a cell, an arrow will be displayed next to it. Clicking on this arrow will open up the list and give the user the option to choose one of the items on the list. This will not only save you space on your spreadsheet but also make you look like like a superuser and impress your co-workers and boss. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to create a dropdown list in Excel.
 
## Step 1: Define the Contents of Your List
 
1. Open up a new Excel worksheet and put down the contents you want to appear on your list. Make sure each entry occupies one cell, and all entries are vertically aligned in the same column. Also, ensure there are no blank cells between the entries. In our case our dropdown menu will open a list of cities to choose from.
 

 
2. Once you’re done assembling the list, highlight all the entries, right-click on them, and select “Define Name” from the menu that will show up.
 
3. This will open a new window with the title “New Name.” Choose a name for your list and enter the same in the “Name” text box.
 
4. Click “OK.”
 
## Step 2: Adding Your Dropdown List to a Spreadsheet
 
The next step is to add your dropdown list to a spreadsheet. Here’s how to do it.
 
1. Open a new or existing worksheet where you want to place your dropdown list.
 
2. Highlight the cell where you want to place the dropdown list. Click the “Data” tab, then locate the “Data validation” icon in the data tools section and click on it.
 
3. A data validation box will appear that has three tabs: Settings, Input Message, and Error Alert. In the Settings tab, select “List” from the “Arrow” dropdown list. A new option titled “Source” will now appear at the bottom of the window. Click the text box and then enter a “=” sign, followed by the name of your dropdown list. In our case it should read =cities.
 
The “Ignore blank” and “In-cell dropdown” boxes are checked by default. With the Ignore blank cell checked, it means it’s okay for people to leave the cell empty. But if you want every user to select an option from the cell, uncheck the box.
 
4. Click OK. That’s it. You have added a dropdown list to your spreadsheet.
 
With that completed, you can now proceed to the Input message tab.
 
## Step 3: Set Input Message for Data Validation (Optional)
 
At times you may want a message (with description) to pop up when the cell containing the dropdown list is clicked. In that case you’ll need to click the “show input message” box in the Input message tab. You’ll also need to fill out the title and the input message in their respective boxes. Your dropdown list should now look something like the following image.
 
The last tab is for the error alert. Once defined, this one sends an error message if someone enters invalid data – data that is not on the list.
 
## Wrapping Up
 
Dropdown lists are very common on websites and are very intuitive for the user. Their versatile nature renders them useful in virtually all industries. Be it in surveys, the business world or even in schools, you’ll always find the need to use Excel dropdown lists.
