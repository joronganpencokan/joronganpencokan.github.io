# Unlock the Secret to Accessing Incredible Data with HGt Files - Learn How to Open Them Now! 

Have you ever come across an HGt file and wondered how to open it? Well, you're not alone. Many people find it challenging to access data from HGt files. In this article, we'll take a look at what HGt files are, how to open them, and why they're so important. 

## What are HGt Files? 

HGt files are files that contain gene expression data. They're commonly used in biomedical research to study genetic data. They're created using software tools, such as GenePattern, and can be used to analyze data from different sources. 

## Why are HGt Files Important? 

HGt files are essential to researchers who are studying gene expression data. They contain valuable data that can help researchers understand how genes work, how they interact with each other, and how they affect different diseases. 

## How to Open HGt Files 

Opening HGt files is easy. You can use software tools such as GenePattern, Bioconductor, or R to open them. These tools are commonly used in the field of biomedical research and are free to download. 

### Using GenePattern 

GenePattern is a popular software tool that can open HGt files. Here are the steps to open an HGt file in GenePattern: 

1. Open GenePattern: Launch GenePattern by clicking on the GenePattern icon on your desktop. 

2. Import the HGt file: Click on the "File" menu and select "Import." Browse to the location where the HGt file is saved and select it. 

3. Select the file format: GenePattern will prompt you to select the file format. Choose the file format that the HGt file is saved in. 

4. Analyze the data: Once the HGt file is imported, you can analyze the data using the various tools available in GenePattern. 

### Using Bioconductor or R 

Bioconductor and R are other software tools that can open HGt files. Here are the steps to open an HGt file in Bioconductor or R: 

1. Install Bioconductor or R: If you haven't already, download and install either Bioconductor or R from their websites. 

2. Import the HGt file: In Bioconductor, use the `read.table` function to import the HGt file. In R, use the `read.csv` function. 

3. Analyze the data: Once the HGt file is imported, you can analyze the data using the various tools available in Bioconductor or R. 

## Conclusion 

HGt files are an essential part of gene expression analysis. By learning how to open them, you'll have access to valuable data that can help you understand how genes work and how they affect different diseases. Hopefully, this article has provided you with the knowledge you need to start working with HGt files.

This article explains what an HGT file is and how it's used, plus how to open one on your computer and how to convert one to a different format.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- An HGT file is a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Data file.Open one with VTBuilder or DG Terrain Viewer.Convert to BT or PNG with VTBuilder.

 
##   What Is an HGT File?  
 

A file with the HGT file extension is a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Data file.

 
HGT is also short for Honeywell Gas Technologies, but that has nothing to do with the file format explained on this page.
 

These files contain digital elevation models, which are 3D pictures of a surface, usually a planet, obtained during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) by NASA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).

 

Used here, "HGT" is just an abbreviation for "height." The file is normally named with the longitude and latitude that the image pertains to, within one degree. For example, the file N33W177.hgt would indicate that it includes data for latitudes 33 to 34 North and longitudes 177 to 178 West.

 
##   How to Open an HGT File  
 

HGT files can be opened with VTBuilder, ArcGIS Pro, and Safe Software's FME Desktop. DG Terrain Viewer works, too, for both Windows and Linux. You can also import it into Blender with the blender-osm addon.

 
See Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, hosted by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, for all the basics on SRTM data, which comes in HGT format. There's also this great overview of SRTM and the data produced.
 
##   How to Convert an HGT File  
 

VTBuilder can export an HGT file to a Binary Terrain (.BT) file. To do this, first import it via Layer > Import Data > Elevation and then save it using the Layer > Save Layer As option.

 
If you're using VTBuilder to open your HGT file, it's not done within the regular Open Project menu item. Instead, you must import the file into the program through the Layer > Import Data > Elevation menu.
 
If you find that a program on your computer does try to open the HGT file but it's the wrong application or you'd rather have another installed program open these files, learn how to change those settings in Windows.
 

VTBuilder also supports exporting to PNG, TIFF, and a number of other common, and not so common, image and data formats.

 

In ArcGIS Pro, with the file already open in the program, you should be able to go to ​Export > Raster to Different Format to save it under a new format.

 

The other programs above can probably convert this file, too. This is normally done through an Export option or a Save As menu.

 
##   Still Can't Open It?  
 

If you have an HGT file that you know isn't an SRTM Data file, or it doesn't work with any of the software you read about above, it could be that your specific file is actually in an entirely different format.

 

If so, use a text editor to open it. Sometimes, there's identifiable text within the file that can help you understand what program was used to build it, which should direct you to more information on the format.

 

If not, maybe you're misreading the file extension, confusing an SRT file for an HGT file. HTG is another example that appears related, but is actually used by HackTheGame for mission pack files.
