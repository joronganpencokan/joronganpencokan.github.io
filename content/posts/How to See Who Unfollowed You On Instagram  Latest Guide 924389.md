# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Find Out Who Unfollowed You On Instagram - Follow These Simple Steps Now!

Instagram is a social media platform that has revolutionized the way we communicate with each other. It allows us to share pictures, stories, and even our daily lives with the people we care about.

However, one of the most infuriating experiences on Instagram is finding out that someone has unfollowed you. It can be disheartening to see the number of followers drop, and you may wonder who these people are and why they unfollowed you.

Thankfully, it's easy to find out who has unfollowed you on Instagram. In this article, we will take a look at the simple steps you can follow to find out who has unfollowed you on Instagram.

## Step 1: Check your followers list

The first thing you should do is to check your followers list. You can do this by tapping on your profile picture, and then tapping on the 'followers' button.

This will give you a list of all the people who are currently following you on Instagram. Take a look at the list and look for the people who you think may have unfollowed you.

## Step 2: Compare with previous followers list

The next step is to compare your current followers list with the previous one. You can do this by looking at your followers list from a few days or a week ago and see if any names are missing.

If you find that someone is missing from your current followers list but was there previously, it means that they've unfollowed you.

## Step 3: Use a third-party app

If you find it tedious to compare your followers list, you can use a third-party app to find out who has unfollowed you on Instagram. There are many apps available for both Android and iOS devices that can help you do this.

One such app is 'Followers - Unfollowers'. This app allows you to see who has unfollowed you, who doesn't follow you back, and who you don't follow back. It's easy to use, and you can get all the information you need in just a few clicks.

## Step 4: Take appropriate action

Once you have found out who has unfollowed you on Instagram, it's up to you to take appropriate action. You can choose to unfollow them back or try to understand why they've unfollowed you in the first place.

If you're a business or an influencer on Instagram, you can use this information to improve your engagement strategy and try to win back your followers.

In conclusion, finding out who has unfollowed you on Instagram is easy if you follow these simple steps. It's important to remember that while losing followers can be disheartening, it's not the end of the world. Instead, use this opportunity to improve your content and engagement strategy and continue to grow your following.

Similarly, others can also follow your public profile. When you follow someone on Instagram, the app notifies the user that you have followed them, but it doesn’t notify you when they unfollow you.
If you are running a business and rely on Instagram for promotion, you might want to track who unfollowed you. In general, there’s no official way to track who unfollowed you on Instagram, but it’s possible to know if any of your followers have unfollowed you on the platform.
