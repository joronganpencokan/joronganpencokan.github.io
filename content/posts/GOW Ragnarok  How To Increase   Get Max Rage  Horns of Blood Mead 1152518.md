The rage meter is a vital component in God of War Ragnarok. It allows players to perform powerful attacks that deal significant damage to enemies. The meter fills up as players hit enemies, take damage, or perform specific actions in the game.

To manage your rage meter effectively, you need to understand how it works. You can increase your rage meter by equipping specific items such as the Gauntlets of the Valkyrie or by upgrading your character's strength stat. You can also use Spartan Rage to increase the meter.

1. Equip the best gear: To increase your strength and fill your rage meter faster, make sure your character has the best equipment. You can obtain top-tier gear by defeating bosses or by completing quests throughout the game.

2. Use Spartan Rage strategically: Don't waste your Spartan Rage on small enemies; instead, save it for bosses or large groups of enemies. Remember, Spartan Rage not only fills up your rage meter but also grants invulnerability and heals your character.

Horns of Blood Mead are another essential item in God of War Ragnarok. They increase your maximum rage meter, allowing you to perform more powerful attacks in combat. You can obtain Horns of Blood Mead throughout the game, but they are not always easy to find.

You should increase your rage meter in God of War Ragnarok to get the most out of it. This meter is important as when it fills up completely you can use Spartan Rage.

So in this guide check out how you can increase your maximum rage in God of War Ragnarok with the help of Horns of Blood Mead.
 
## How to Increase your Maximum Rage in God of War Ragnarok
 
You can increase your rage by finding Horns of Blood Mead from the Nornir chests. This is the only method that lets you upgrade it permanently. While you can upgrade your fury to decrease the amount of rage that is consumed. There is no similar upgrade or any kind of armor piece that lets you increase it, so finding Horns of Blood Mead is your only option. And the catch is you need to find 3 of them in order to upgrade the rage meter once. After you get 3 you can see the red rage bar increase.
 
### How to Open Nornir Chests
 
The mechanics of how Nornir chests work is the same as that of God of War (2018). First, you need to find a large chest that has 3 runes symbols. You cannot open it directly, as these runes work as a seal for it. So you have to look for these 3 runes and destroy them, they should be in the vicinity of the chest. Use your Leviathan Axe to launch it at these runes to break them. After you break all three of them, the seal will release and you can open the Nornir chest. From the chest, you will either find Horns of Blood Mead or Idunn Apples. The second one is used to increase your health permanently.
