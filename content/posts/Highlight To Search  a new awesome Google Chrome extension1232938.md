Google is always trying to tweak a bit their products, this time is with a new extension. Yesterday, Google published an article in Google Chrome Blog highlighting some of the new Chrome extensions that they think are worth the try. There are so many extensions for Google Chrome that sometimes you just need a little recommendation. Well… What is interesting is the last extension that they mentioned. It’s called Highlight To Search and it seems that is an awesome one.
 
This is a really simple extension that you just have to give a try. Basically after you installed Highlight To Search, any keyword or phrase that you highlight with the mouse on any web page, a search magnifying glass icon, right below it will appear. When clicking on that icon a very small search box will open filled with the keyword or phrase that you selected. You will also notice that some related suggestions will be generated in form of drop-down list (in the same way that it will appear when typing a search in Google home page). And by clicking the suggested term or the magnifying glass icon will open up your search results in a new Chrome tab.
 
This is simple and useful, really similar to what we already do in Google Chrome when we select a keyword or phrase and right-click on it and selecting Search Google for.
 
With this extension you are only saving the right-click time, but it gives something extra to the Google Chrome’s UI and complements a little better with the new Google Instant Search model.
