Step 1: Choosing Your Character's Class

The first step in creating your character is choosing its class. Lost Ark has five different classes, namely Warrior, Mage, Gunner, Fighter, and Assassin. Each class has unique abilities and skills that are tailored to a specific play style, so choose one that aligns with your preferred gaming style.

Warrior: This class is ideal for players who love close combat and melee fighting.

Mage: This class is perfect for players who prefer to fight from a distance and use magic.

Gunner: This class is ideal for players who love high tech, guns, and other ranged weapons.

Fighter: This class is well suited for players who prefer a balanced approach to combat, using both melee and ranged attacks.

Assassin: This class is perfect for players who prefer stealth and speed, allowing them to move swiftly and attack their enemies from behind.

Step 2: Personalizing Your Character's Appearance

After choosing your character's class, the next step is personalizing its appearance. Lost Ark has a wide array of customization options that allow you to create a unique character that stands out from the crowd.

Step 3: Selecting Your Character's Stats

The next step is selecting your character's stats. Lost Ark has three different stats, namely Strength, Intelligence, and Dexterity. Each stat plays a crucial role in determining your character's performance in combat, so choose wisely.

Strength: This stat primarily affects your character's melee combat abilities, making it ideal for Warriors and Fighters.

Intelligence: This stat primarily affects your magic abilities, making it ideal for Mages.

Dexterity: This stat primarily affects your ranged combat abilities, making it ideal for Gunners and Assassins.

Step 4: Choosing Your Character's Skills

Basic Skills: These are the skills that you start with, and they are essential for your character's survival.

Active Skills: These are the skills that you can use in combat, and they are vital for defeating bosses and progressing through different worlds.
