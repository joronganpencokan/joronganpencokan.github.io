# Revolutionary New Google 1 Button Takes Social Media by Storm - Say Goodbye to Likes Forever!

What if we told you that your social media experience is about to change for the better? Well, Google has been cooking up something that will revolutionize the way you interact with content online. The tech giant has introduced the Google 1 button, a feature that aims to replace the decades-old Like button on social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. Here's why it could potentially change social media as we know it.

## What is the Google 1 Button?

The Google 1 button is a fresh, innovative approach to the concept of social validation that we've come to accept in modern times. Essentially, it's a button that lets you express your appreciation or approval of content through usage on integrated websites, such as blogs, news articles, and online stores. Similar to the concept of a Like/Favorite/Heart icon, the Google 1 Button allows you to give a virtual "thumbs up" to web content you want to acknowledge positively.

However, what sets the Google 1 Button apart from its social media predecessors is the absence of public display associated with it. Unlike the Likes, Favorites and Hearts shown under each post on social media pages, Google will only display a cumulative count of clicks on the Button, meaning other people won't necessarily know or can't see what content you approve of, which may seem liberating to some.

## Why is the Google 1 Button Revolutionary?

Despite its simplicity and subtle nature, the Google 1 Button has some groundbreaking implications that could change the world of social media forever. Here are some reasons why the Google 1 Button is a game-changer:

- No More Toxic Social Validation: The race for likes and followers has become a toxic norm of social media culture. People stress over the number of likes they receive, as it gives them a sense of artificial validation. The Google 1 Button can potentially shift focus to content quality instead of social validation competitions as it does not display public counts.
- Better Metrics for Content Creators and Marketers: Publishing content online nowadays can be frustrating for content creators and companies as it's challenging to derive insights from social media users' general engagement. The Google 1 Button could provide better click-through rates and engagement metrics than other social media platforms by creating measurable interaction without the fear of public scrutiny.
- Increased Privacy: People are becoming increasingly more concerned about privacy today, and the Google 1 Button provides the option to interact with content without putting themselves in the public spotlight. Integrating it into third-party apps and online services could help users interact anonymously with publishers and bloggers.
- Improved Search Results: The numbers provided by the Google 1 Button can give Google's algorithms a better insight into what content is relevant and engaging. This data can help improve search results in ensuring that more quality content is surfaced.

## The Future of Social Media

With increasing talks of data privacy concerns and harmful online environments, the Google 1 Button's subtle and anonymous nature could potentially put social media platforms on notice to innovate and lessen the burden of public validation competitions. Although it's still early in its implementation, the Google 1 Button can expand to be a differentiator and eventually be adopted further widely by social media platforms.

The likes and favorites we've become accustomed to may soon disappear, but the Google 1 Button's benefits could make the shift worthwhile. So get ready to cheer up that browsing session or give a virtual high-five to your favorite blogger or news source without the burden of public scrutiny. 

The Google 1 Button's ultimate effect is yet to be determined, but one thing is for sure: it has set the tone for modernization of social media norms, and it may just be the start of something new.

It seems that Google refuses to give up and is trying to push once again its way into the social space, by introducing a new feature called “+1” that it will basically have the same functionality as the Facebook “Like” button does (share recommended content with other people). And yes, even though Facebook has been doing this for sometime now, they do have the advantage of early start, but it would not be hard to think that the Google +1 button could quickly gain popularity, knowing that it is going to be integrated on the search results of the world’s most used search engine, giving them plenty exposure to buildup influence.
 
The service isn’t really active yet, but if you cannot wait starting today Wednesday, you can  participate in the +1 button experiment from Google Labs and soon after you join, you will start seeing the new “plus one” button in the Google search result next to the links.
 
This is how the +1 button will appear in the search result:
 

 
And this is how the +1 will appear after you pressed it. Notice that you also will have the options to undo the action right away:
 
The idea is, when you +1 something, you are publicly giving your stamp of approval (according to Google). In other words once you +1 something your Google profile — which is required to use this new feature and also the place where you can see all the links that +1 — is attached or associated to the link for search results, ads, and all across the Web.
 
This YouTube video below explains the +1 button concept in more detail:
 
As always with anything new, Google is slowly pushing this new feature out and is starting with the English Google.com version, and in the coming weeks the Google +1 button will start appearing in other Google.com languages and other Google products. The company is also planning on having available a +1 button that publishers can take advantage of and let readers +1 content without the need of leaving the Web page — sounds familiar? –.
