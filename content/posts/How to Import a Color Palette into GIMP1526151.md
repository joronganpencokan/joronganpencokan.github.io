Graphic design is not just a professionâ€”it is an art. Good design requires a good understanding of color theory, typography, and layout. And while mastering these skills takes time, there is one way to quickly revamp your designs: by incorporating a stunning color palette. In this tutorial, we will teach you a simple secret to import a gorgeous color palette into GIMP, a free and open-source image editor.

Step 1: Find a Color Palette

Before we start importing a color palette, we need to find one that we like. There are many sources for inspiration, such as Pinterest, Dribbble, and Adobe Color. For this tutorial, we will use Adobe Color, formerly known as Adobe Kuler. Here are the steps to find a color palette in Adobe Color:

3. Browse through the various color palettes and select one that you like.
4. Click on the palette to see the individual colors and their values.

Step 2: Export the Color Palette

Once you have found a color palette, you can export it as a palette file. A palette file is a file that contains the color values of the palette. Here are the steps to export a color palette from Adobe Color:

1. Click on the "Download" button on the top right corner.
2. Select "Color Table (ACT)" as the file format.
3. Give the file a name and save it on your computer.

6. Your imported color palette should now appear in the "Palettes" window.

Step 4: Use the Imported Color Palette in Your Designs

1. Create a new document or open an existing one.
2. Click on the "Colors" menu on the top menu bar.
