#You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Convert ESD Files To ISO In Windows - Check Out This Life-Changing Hack Now!


Have you ever faced a situation where you have an ESD (Electronic Software Download) file, but you need an ISO (International Organization for Standardization) image for installing the operating system? Or maybe you want to create a bootable USB drive with Windows OS for fresh installation, but all you have is an ESD file?

If you've ever faced any of these situations, you'll be happy to know that there's a life-changing hack that you can use. In this article, we'll show you how to convert ESD files to ISO in Windows quickly and easily.

Before we dive into the conversion process, let's first understand the difference between an ESD file and an ISO file.

##What is an ESD file?
An ESD file is a compressed and encrypted file that contains the installation files required for installing Windows OS. It's similar to an ISO file, but the difference is that ESD files are compressed, which makes them smaller in size compared to ISO files.

##What is an ISO file?
An ISO file is an archive file that contains all the files necessary for installing an operating system. It's a complete clone of the original disk from which the data is extracted, and it's commonly used to create bootable USB or CD/DVD drives.

Now that we know the difference between the two file formats, let's see how you can convert an ESD file to ISO in Windows.

##Method 1: Using the ESD to ISO Conversion Tool
The easiest way to convert an ESD file to ISO is by using the ESD to ISO Conversion Tool. This tool is a small and straightforward software that can convert ESD files to ISO files in just a few clicks.

Here's how to use the ESD to ISO Conversion Tool:

1. Download the ESD to ISO Conversion Tool from the official website.
2. Install the software by following the on-screen instructions.
3. Open the ESD to ISO Conversion Tool and select the ESD file you want to convert.
4. Choose the destination folder where you want to save the ISO file.
5. Click on the "Convert" button, and wait for the software to convert the ESD file to ISO.

That's it! You have successfully converted the ESD file to ISO using the ESD to ISO Conversion Tool.

##Method 2: Using Windows Command Prompt
If you prefer using the command prompt instead of a third-party software, you can also convert ESD to ISO using Windows Command Prompt. Here are the steps:

1. Press the Windows Key + X and click on Command Prompt (Admin).
2. Type the following command and press Enter: cd Desktop
3. Now, type the following command and press Enter: install.esd /decrypt
4. Wait for the decryption process to complete. You will see a new file named "install.wim" on your desktop.
5. Type the following command and press Enter: dism /Get-WimInfo /WimFile:C:\Users\Username\Desktop\install.wim
6. Note down the index number of the Windows version that you want to create ISO from.
7. Type the following command and press Enter: dism /Export-Image /SourceImageFile:C:\Users\Username\Desktop\install.wim /SourceIndex:1 /DestinationImageFile:C:\Users\Username\Desktop\Windows.iso /Compress:recovery

That's it! You have successfully converted the ESD file to ISO using Windows Command Prompt.

##Conclusion
In this article, we showed you two different methods to convert ESD files to ISO in Windows. The first method uses the ESD to ISO Conversion Tool, which is an easy-to-use software that can perform the conversion quickly. The second method involves using Windows Command Prompt, which may be a little technical, but it's an excellent option if you prefer using the command line.

We hope this article has been helpful to you, and now you can easily convert ESD files to ISO in Windows whenever you need to.

Microsoft uses the ESD (Electronic Software Download) image file format to supply Windows upgrades, updates, and other components. For instance, Microsoft lets developers download the latest Windows 10 builds in the ESD format. The developers can then use them to install or upgrade Windows. The ESD image files are very compressed and encrypted. As such, you cannot open them or use them as regular ISO files. Before you can do anything, you need to decrypt and extract the contents.
 
If you want to create a bootable drive, you need to create an ISO file from the extracted content. There are several free tools that do all this for you with just a few clicks. In this article we’ll show you how to convert ESD to ISO in Windows 10.
 
## Convert ESD to ISO Using ESD Toolkit (Command Line)
 
ESD Toolkit is a free and portable command-line tool, though, it does everything for you automatically, e.g. decryption, extraction, and conversion. All you have to do is point it towards the ESD file and select an option.
 
1. First, download ESD Toolkit and extract the contents to a folder of your choice.
 
2. Having the ESD image file in the same folder as the contents of ESD Toolkit is quite helpful, so copy the ESD image file to the ESD Toolkit folder.
 

 
3. Open the ESD file using ESD Toolkit. For that, drag and drop the ESD file onto the “ESDISO.bat” file to open it.
 
4. In the command window type “N” and press Enter.
 
5. The program asks if you want to use a custom destination for your ISO file. Type “N” and press Enter. If you want to save the ISO file in some other location, type “Y” and set the location.
 
6. ESD Toolkit will ask you to choose the ESD file to convert. Since we’ve opened the program with the ESD file, it will be listed in the command window. Type the number associated with the ESD file and press Enter. In this case that number is “1.”
 
7. As soon as you select the file, ESD Toolkit will start the conversion process. It can take anywhere from fifteen to thirty minutes, depending on your system resources, so sit back and wait until it’s complete.
 
8. Once done, the program will close. You can find the converted ISO file in the same directory as the ESD Toolkit.
 
You can now use the ISO file to create a bootable Windows 10 CD/DVD or USB drive.
 
## Convert ESD to ISO Using NTLite (GUI)
 
If you don’t like using command-line tools, you can use NTLite. NTLite is a powerful software and contains a lot of different tools along with the ESD to ISO conversion tool.
 
1. Download NTLite, install it like any other Windows software, and launch it. While installing it gives you the option to install in portable mode. Select this option if you don’t want to install NTLite.
 
2. When you launch the application, it will ask you to choose the license. For this cause the free license works just fine, so select “Free” under Options and click “OK.”
 
3. Drag and drop the ESD file onto the NTLite program. If it shows a warning window, simply click the “OK” button to proceed.
 
4. Select “Operating systems” under the Image History category, and click the “Convert -> WIM (Standard, editable)” option. This will decrypt and extract the ESD file. The process will take anywhere from  fifteen to thirty minutes to complete, so sit back and wait until it completes.
 
5. Once decryption and extraction have been completed, select the extracted folder, and click on the “Create ISO” button.
 
6. NTLite will ask you the name the ISO file. Enter a name and click the “OK” button. You can see the destination location under the Label field.
 
7. NTLite will start the ISO creation process. It takes around two to five minutes to complete.
 
8. Once completed, the ISO file will be automatically saved to the earlier shown destination.
