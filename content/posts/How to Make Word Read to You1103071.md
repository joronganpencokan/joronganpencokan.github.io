Title: You'll Never Have to Read Again: Learn How to Have your Computer Read to You with Ease!

Introduction:

Reading is a time-consuming task that requires a certain level of skill and dedication. Whether you are a student trying to finish a research paper or a professional who has to review lengthy reports, reading can be daunting at times. However, what if you could have your computer read to you? Wouldn't that make your life easier? Well, good news! Your computer can read to you, and it's not difficult to set up. In this article, we'll discuss how you can have your computer read to you with ease.

Heading 1: Using Text-to-Speech

The most common way of having your computer read to you is through text-to-speech technology. Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of software that converts written text into speech. There are many TTS software options available, some of which come built-in with operating systems like Windows and MacOS. To access TTS software, you simply need to select the text you want to hear and use the software's command to have your computer read it to you.

Heading 2: Installing Third-Party TTS Software

If your operating system doesn't have TTS software built-in, there are many third-party options you can download and install. Some popular options include NaturalReader, Balabolka, and Read Aloud. These software options offer a range of customizable features, such as voice options, reading speed, and formatting options. Installing a third-party TTS software is simple and usually requires only a few clicks.

Heading 3: Using Google Docs

If you use Google Docs, you can also take advantage of its built-in TTS feature. To use this feature, select the text you want to hear and then highlight it. Once it's selected, click on the "Tools" option in the top menu, and then select "Accessibility." Finally, select "Speak" from the drop-down menu. Google Docs will then start reading the text to you.

Heading 4: Using Web Browsers

Most web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, have built-in TTS capabilities. To use this feature, highlight the text you want to hear, right-click, and select the "Speak" option. If this feature is not available, you can download a browser extension like SpeakIt for Google Chrome or Speak for Firefox.

Conclusion:

Overall, having your computer read to you is an easy and efficient way to save time and reduce the strain on your eyes. There are many TTS software options available, and most are easy to download and install. You can also make use of built-in TTS features in programs like Google Docs and web browsers. So, the next time you have a long piece of text to read, give your eyes a break and let your computer do the work for you.

There are several options available to have Word read the text aloud to you so you'll know what's on the page even if you can't fully see the text or you want to hear how it flows. Here's how to make Word read to you.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Select the Read Aloud icon in the ribbon under the Review menu to hear the entire document narrated.Add the Speak command to the Quick Look Toolbar and select the Speak icon to narrate the text you've highlighted in your document.Read Aloud sounds better but is only available in versions of Office after 2019. The Speak feature is available in Office 2003 and later.

 
##   How to Make Word Read to You  
 

From within Microsoft Word, there are two main features to make Word read to you. The first is Read Aloud, which will read the entire page. The second is Speak, which will read aloud only the text you've selected.

 
###   How to Use Read Aloud in Word  
 

You can only use the Read Aloud feature in Word if you have Office 2019, Office 2021, or Microsoft 365. Otherwise, you'll need to upgrade Office to enjoy this feature.

 
- Select the Review menu and select Read Aloud from the ribbon.
 - You'll want to first open the document you'd like Microsoft Word to read aloud to you. Without a document open, the Read Aloud controls won't do anything.
 - This option will open the Read Aloud controls at the upper right corner of your open document. There are five buttons to control the Read Aloud feature. To hear the text read aloud to you, press the Play icon in these controls (the right arrow icon).
 - You'll hear a voice reading the text aloud. You'll also notice that the play icon has now changed to a Pause icon (two vertical lines). Press the Pause button if you want to pause the audio voice wherever it's currently reading. When you're ready to start listening again, press the Play button.
 - You will also notice two other buttons to the right and left of the Play/Pause button. These are two left arrows (Previous) and two right arrows (Next). These buttons will let you navigate forward or backward one paragraph, which is helpful if you aren't interested in hearing the current paragraph anymore and want the narration to skip back or ahead.
 - When you finish listening to the document being read aloud, you can stop the Read Aloud feature by selecting the Stop icon (an X icon).

 

Remember, you don't need to use your mouse to control Microsoft Word Read Aloud. You can use the following keyboard shortcuts instead.

###   Enable and Use Speak in Word  
 

Microsoft incorporated the Speak feature into Microsoft Office 2003. That means even if you don't have a newer version of Microsoft Word with Read Aloud available, you can still use the Speak feature. The only difference is you'll need to highlight the text you want to hear narrated first.

 
- Before you can use the Speak feature, you'll need to enable it in the Quick Access Toolbar. To do this, select File, Options, and Quick Access Toolbar from the left menu. Select All Commands from the Choose commands from drop-down menu.
 - Scroll down to and select Speak, and select the Add button in the middle to add the Speak feature to the Quick Access Toolbar. Select OK to finish.
 - Make sure the Show Quick Access Toolbar checkbox is selected, or you won't be able to see the toolbar even if Speak is enabled.
 - To use the Speak feature, highlight the text you want to hear narrated. You can select the entire document if you wish. Once you've highlighted the text, select the Speak icon from the Quick Access Toolbar.
 - You will hear the text narrated in a digitized voice. At any time, if you want to stop the narration, you can select the Speak icon again, and the narration will stop.
