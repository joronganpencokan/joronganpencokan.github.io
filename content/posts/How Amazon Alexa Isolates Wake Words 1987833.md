Title: Shocking! Amazon Alexa's Secret Trick to Isolate Wake Words Revealed!

Introduction:
Amazon Alexa has become a household name, and it is rare to find any home in the US that does not contain the smart speaker. From just a music player to a great source of household assistance, Amazon Alexa has grown into an irreplaceable part of our daily lives. One of the most amazing features of Alexa is the wake word. Users can call Alexa by a particular name or word, and the smart speaker will respond by carrying out the command given. This feature has brought so many people to Alexa, and they find it hard to use any other assistant. However, Alexa has a secret trick to isolate wake words that have just been revealed. 

Body Paragraphs:
How does Alexa respond when you call its name? The wake word is responsible for this. The wake word is the phrase used to activate and direct Alexa’s attention to listen and execute your command. Alexa’s wake word was initially just “Alexa,” but later on, it was possible for users to change their wake words, just in case Alexa was activated by accident. At the moment, users can choose different wake words like “Echo,” “Computer”, “Amazon” and many others. However, Alexa’s response to the wake word might not always be positive, especially when you have a noisy environment. Alexa’s wake word has a trick that isolates it from environmental noise, and it works in a way that is pretty unique.

Alexa’s secret trick to isolate wake words involves splitting the wake word into two simultaneously activated parts. Alexa’s ability to isolate a wake word from environmental noise is known as the back-end processing. This processing can detect the word or phrase that comes before the wake word and work with it to improve the accuracy of the activation. When you say the wake word, Alexa is listening to the conversation or sounds before and after the word to ensure that it is indeed the wake word that requires action. This feature allows Alexa to ignore everything else that has been said and focus on the task at hand.

In summary, Alexa’s secret trick to isolate a wake word involves splitting the wake word into two parts and using the back-end processing to improve accuracy. Whenever you call Alexa, it listens to your conversation before and after the word to verify that it is the wake word's command before it begins to execute the command. 

Conclusion:
Alexa's wake word trick has made using the smart speaker easier and more fun. Users can now call Alexa with a lot of ease and enjoy the convenience that comes with it. As Alexa continues to evolve, we expect more tricks that will make using the smart speaker even more comfortable in the coming years. Therefore, next time you call Alexa, know that the secret trick, which is the back-end processing, is working to ensure the execution of your commands with the highest accuracy.

## Three Technologies Working Together
 
There are three technologies in the Alexa system that, when they work together, enable the device to recognize the wake word. Nothing else will begin the recording. These technologies are the microphones in the machine, a three-second memory buffer, and neural net training.
 
### Microphones
 
The microphones also determine the direction the word comes from so they can focus in that direction. When the device determines the direction, a lighter blue color light will follow the sound of your voice.
 
### Limited memory
 
The memory built into the Echo device only retains three seconds worth of data at a time. Then the data is erased and written over. For those of you old enough to remember cassette tapes, it would be like recording for three seconds and then rewinding to the beginning and recording for three seconds again. Alexa does not transmit data until after it recognizes the wake word.
 
### Neural net training
 
Every word that Alexa hears runs through several layers of testing. This testing determines if the word is the wake word. After the word passes through several layers of verification, and the Echo device determines that it was indeed the wake word, Alexa begins recording.
 
## Accuracy of wake word recognition
 
People worry that Alexa will begin recording without actually hearing the wake word. So it is vital that Alexa does not start recording without someone directly speaking to it. Recognizing the word and not getting it confused with other words is a top priority.
 
## Erasing Stored Conversations
 
If you don’t want Alexa listening for the wake word, the simplest thing to do is to press the mute button on the top of the device. It won’t listen until you turn the microphones back on.
 
You can change your settings to keep your data private. On the mobile app, open the settings and then select “Manage How Your Data Improves Alexa,” then toggle the switches to the off position.
 
You can now even tell Alexa to forget everything you said that day. First, enable the skill by opening the settings, then Review Voice History. Turn the switch on. Then when you say, “Alexa, delete everything I said today,” the server deletes all the data from that day.
