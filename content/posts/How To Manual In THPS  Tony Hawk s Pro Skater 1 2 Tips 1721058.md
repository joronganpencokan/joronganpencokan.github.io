## How to Manual in THPS 1 + 2
 

 
To make your skater perform a Manual in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, you have to do the following things:
 
For a Manual, you have press Up and then Down before landing. And for a Nose Manual, you have to press Down and then Up before landing. For PC players, that’s W then S for Manual and S then W for Nose Manual. This can be easily done on the ground.
 
You can also do this while you are in the air in order to get into a manual. If you are doing an Ollie (Jump), make sure to enter a Manual after that right before landing.
 
Apart from this, you can do some chain tricks where you can do a kickflip, manual and then move to another small trick. You will need some practice for it because if you do a Nose Manual and then go Up, you will bail. This will happen when you mistime a Manual or mistime your landing. When you bail, your Special bar will get drained and your character will fall to the ground.
 
That’s all the basics of performing a Manual in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2. Once you get a hang of it, you will be able to perform more advanced moves easily. Don’t miss our other guides on how to move faster, and How to increase stats easily.
