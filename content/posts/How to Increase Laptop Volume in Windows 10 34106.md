If you thought the default sound quality of your laptop could be better, you’re one-hundred percent correct. Many of us are content with increasing the system volume, but the results aren’t always satisfactory. What can you do if the speaker bars are maxed out, and you’re still having a hard time getting optimal audio quality?
 
The following simple methods will help you solve the low volume problem in a Windows laptop forever. Use these fixes to increase your laptop volume in Windows 10.
 
## 1. Use Preamp Values in EqualizerAPO
 
As a first step, you may want to check your speaker or headphone properties for equalization. This can be achieved in the “Properties” of your audio device from the “Enhancements” tab.
 
Next, download this free utility called EqualizerAPO to adjust the sound values manually. After a simple installation, go to the folder where the program is stored and open the “Config” file with Notepad.
 
Here, you can edit the “Preamp” value from the default (usually a minus value) to 10 or 20 dB. What this means is that you’re setting the filters with a positive gain. Close the file and save it. Remember: too much of pre-amp will induce distortion, so 20 dB is more than enough to get you the largest audio boost you’re looking for.
 
Go to “Speaker Properties” and the “Advanced” tab. Here, you can change the default format to its maximum value for studio-quality surround sound.
 
## 2. Use Fx Sound Enhancer
 
In most laptops you will get very loud audio after following the steps in Method 1. However, some speakers and cheap headphones still leave a lot to be desired. Download an external app called FxSound Enhancer which boosts sound quality by correcting the limitations of your sound devices. Make sure the playback device has been set to your default speaker or headphone.
 
As a first step, you can go for presets. However, you can also increase the frequency bands for bass, fidelity, ambience, and 3D surround sound.
 
Play a sample song or video. The sound quality requires very minor band adjustments for an optimal experience. The controlled increase in volumes puts you in firm control of the overall volumes. The software is available as a seven-day free trial, followed by a lifetime purchase of $39.99.
 
## 3. Use your smartphone as a microphone for your laptop
 
If you have a more-recent smartphone, chances are that its microphone quality is a lot better than your computer’s. You can make use of your phone’s mic in your laptop. For this, you need to download and install a software called WO Mic. Install the WO Mic client, which will receive audio data and passes it to a virtual mic device.
 
You also need to install the correct WO Mic driver on the Windows laptop.
 
Download the WO Mic client on Google Play or App Store. Enable a transport using Wi-Fi. You may also connect using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct or USB.
 
If using Wi-Fi to connect, note down the relevant IP address which will be used to connect to the WO Mic client on the laptop.
 
Open the WO Mic client on your laptop and edit the server IP address to your phone. Now the server can be started on your phone. Click “OK” to continue.
 
Once the connection has been established, play the WO Mic client in speaker mode. Now you can use your smartphone as a microphone on your laptop. This will be very loud indeed.
 
## Conclusion
 
Sometimes your favorite movie or song may not sound very loud and clear as before. The above methods should help to increase the laptop volume and improve the default audio quality of the laptop.
