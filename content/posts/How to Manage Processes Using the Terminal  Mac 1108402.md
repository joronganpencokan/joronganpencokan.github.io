# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Manage Processes Using the Terminal on Your Mac!

If you are a Mac user, then you probably know that the Terminal app on your machine is a powerful tool that can be used to perform a variety of functions. One of the most useful things you can do with the Terminal is to manage processes. Whether you need to stop a process that is causing problems or check the status of a particular job, the Terminal can provide you with the information and tools you need to get the job done quickly and efficiently.

Here’s how to manage processes using the Terminal on your Mac:

## 1. Launch the Terminal App

To get started, open the Terminal app on your machine. You can do this by going to Applications > Utilities > Terminal. Once the app is open, you will see a window with a command prompt.

## 2. Use the ‘ps’ Command to View Processes

The ‘ps’ command is used to view the list of processes running on your Mac. To use this command, simply type ‘ps’ into the Terminal window and hit enter. You will see a list of all the processes that are currently running on your system, along with their process IDs (PIDs).

## 3. Stop a Process Using the ‘kill’ Command

If you need to stop a specific process, you can use the ‘kill’ command. To do this, you will need to know the PID of the process you want to stop. You can find this information by using the ‘ps’ command. Once you have the PID, type ‘kill’ followed by the PID number and hit enter. This will stop the process immediately.

## 4. Monitor Processes using the ‘top’ Command

The ‘top’ command can be used to monitor real-time system processes. It provides a real-time view of your Mac’s memory and CPU usage, as well as information about each process running on your system. To use the ‘top’ command, simply type ‘top’ into the Terminal window and hit enter. You will see a real-time view of your system processes.

## 5. Use the ‘jobs’ Command to View Running Processes

If you have a process running in the background and you want to view its status, you can use the ‘jobs’ command. This command will show you a list of all the running background processes. To use the ‘jobs’ command, simply type ‘jobs’ into the Terminal window and hit enter. You will see a list of all the background processes, along with their process IDs.

With these simple commands, you can easily manage and monitor processes on your Mac using the Terminal app. And the best part is that it’s all surprisingly easy to do!

One of the most frustrating moments that a person can experience is the untimely appearance of the spinning rainbow wheel. It’s an inconvenience at its best and a sign of temporary death for whatever program one may be working in at its worst. If you’re getting taunted by that rotating circle of colors, then it might be time to start taking action against it. We’ve got a few commands you can take into Terminal to combat that colorful bringer of death.

Note: For experienced Linux users, these commands are very basic and child’s play, but for Mac users who are too used to the graphical interface, having a knowledge of these commands will help you out when your system is not responding. For new Linux users, the following tricks will work on your system too.
 
## Monitoring Your Processes
 
First and foremost, you’ll want to be proactive with your Terminal use to keep applications from going terminal. The best way to do this is to monitor disk activity. To take a look at what’s going on in your Mac at any given time, open up the Terminal and type 
 
 This will present you with a listing of everything that is happening under the hood of your machine.
 

 
Included in this read out are the processes that are running on your system. They are shown on the bottom half of the screen. The information that is laid out across the screen may seem hard to read, but there are a few important details that you can glean from the Terminal. Important areas to check include the 
 
- %CPU – which tells the amount of CPU the given process is utilizing
 - Time – which denotes the accumulated amount of time an application has taken up.
 - PID, or Process Identification – This number will come in handy when dealing with a specific individual application or process.

 
If you’d like to find a specific application to focus your attention on – perhaps for being particularly problematic to you – that isn’t showing up within your list, you can find it within the Terminal command lines by using the command 
 
For example, if you were to “ps -ax | grep TextEdit,” the Terminal would spit out information about that application, including that ever important PID number.
 
## Killing a Process
 
Once you have the PID of a troublesome process, you can eliminate your struggles with ease without leaving the terminal. This is where the Terminal becomes your sword against the sworn enemy, the spinning rainbow wheel.
 
With the PID of your problem process, type in the command 
 
The “-9” in the command line dictates to the Terminal that your command is not ignorable, essentially guaranteeing to you that the execution will take place.
 
If you still have problems killing the program, it could be possible that program isn’t being run by you and instead is the action of the root user. There is a work around for this. Simply add “sudo” to the front of your command, making the full line read as 
 
This command will then prompt a administrative password request which when fulfilled will complete the kill request.
 
Using the Terminal can be an affective way to monitor and manage your processes and their functions within your computer. If you notice a process that you don’t recall launching, are having difficulties with a particular program, or simply need to free up some of your CPU, these commands for your Terminal should be kept close. Use them with care, because a typo command could be problematic. Following the directions above should lead to a satisfying way to manage your machine.
