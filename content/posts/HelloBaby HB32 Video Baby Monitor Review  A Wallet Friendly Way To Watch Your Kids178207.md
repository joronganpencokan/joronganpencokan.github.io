You Won't Believe How This Wallet-Friendly Video Baby Monitor Keeps Your Kids Safe!

Raising children is a challenging task that takes a lot of time and effort. One of the biggest concerns of parents is the safety of their little ones. As a result, many parents invest in a variety of tools, such as baby monitors, to keep tabs on their children even when they are not in the room. However, not all baby monitors are created equal, and many can be quite expensive. That's why we're excited to introduce a wallet-friendly video baby monitor that will keep your kids safe and secure without breaking the bank.

The video baby monitor in question is the Goowls Baby Monitor, and it's packed with features that will give you peace of mind while your children sleep or play in another room. In this article, we'll review the best features of the Goowls Baby Monitor and explain why it's the perfect choice for budget-conscious parents.

Crystal Clear Picture

One of the most important features of any baby monitor is the video quality, and the Goowls Baby Monitor does not disappoint in this area. With its high-definition 1080p camera, you'll be able to see every detail of your child's room, even in low-light conditions. You'll never miss a moment, whether your child is sleeping peacefully or playing with their toys.

Wide-Angle View

The Goowls Baby Monitor also boasts a wide-angle view, allowing you to see the entire room without having to move the camera. This is particularly useful if you have a curious child who likes to explore every corner of their room. You'll be able to keep an eye on them at all times, ensuring their safety without having to physically be in the room.

Two-Way Audio

Another great feature of the Goowls Baby Monitor is the two-way audio system. This system allows you to talk to your child through the monitor, and they can talk back to you. This is perfect for soothing a fussy baby or encouraging a child to go back to sleep. It's also an excellent way to communicate with your child when you're not in the room with them.

Motion Detection

The Goowls Baby Monitor also comes with a motion detection feature that alerts you when there is movement in your child's room. This is perfect for parents who want to keep an eye on their child's activities, even when they're not physically present. You'll receive instant alerts on your phone whenever your child moves, allowing you to quickly check on them and ensure their safety.

Easy to Set Up and Use

Finally, the Goowls Baby Monitor is incredibly easy to set up and use. It comes with a user manual that will guide you through the setup process step by step. Once you've set it up, you can control it using your phone or tablet, allowing you to access your child's video feed from anywhere.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the Goowls Baby Monitor is an excellent choice for parents who want to keep their children safe and secure without breaking the bank.

We purchased the HelloBaby HB32 Video Baby Monitor so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.

 

Whether your little one is sleeping in their crib or playing with their toys, it’s always nice to keep an eye on them when you’re in the other room. While there are plenty of audio baby monitors on the market, the added benefit of having a video stream can make a huge difference in giving you that extra little peace of mind. There are dozens of fantastic options to choose from, but the budget-friendly HelloBaby HB32 Video Baby Monitor stands out for its solid range and night vision capability. We spent over six weeks testing the device and despite lackluster video quality, we found it to be a reliable unit.

 
##   Design: Par for the course  
 

As with all standalone video baby monitor systems, the HelloBaby Video Monitor features a small infant unit (with the camera) and a parent unit (with the screen). The two devices feature a fairly standard design and both feature smooth edges and a contoured design.

 

The infant unit consists of a base (which the camera pivots on), a camera module, an infrared LED array, a plugin in the back to power the device, and a small antenna at the top to increase range. As you might expect for a more budget-style system, the infant unit doesn’t offer any physical pan/tilt functionality, meaning any time you want to change the composition of the image you’ll need to manually pivot the infant unit’s camera on the base. We found this a bit inconvenient, but if you position it right the first time and don’t have too large of a room to work with it’s not too much of an issue.

 
Overall, you’ll have a hard time finding a video baby monitor with the specs of the HelloBaby at this price point, so if it checks all the boxes, it’s well worth going for.
 
##   Setup Process: Easy enough  
 

Getting started with the HelloBaby Video Monitor is as easy as taking the components out of the box, plugging in the battery to the parent unit, plugging in the infant unit, and turning the devices on. Pairing via the onboard menu took roughly 30-seconds and once connected we were ready to roll.

 
##   Video Quality: Could use some work  
 

The HelloBaby Video Monitor is a bit on the cheaper side for video quality. We tested the unit in nearly every lighting condition and no matter how much light there was in the room, the video quality never seemed to be as good as the display. HelloBaby doesn’t share the exact resolution or specifications, so we don’t know if it’s a limitation of the camera on the baby unit or the monitor, but the image always seemed a bit pixellated. That said, the image was clear enough to keep tabs on where our little one was in the room and know what he was getting into throughout the day.

 

At night, the video quality was even worse, compounded by the infrared LED lights on the infant unit that seemed to be far too harsh and focused. The image was either too bright or too dark and getting it just right required meticulous placement of the infant unit. Again, once we found the sweet spot, the camera was more than adequate for watching our little one at night, but getting there wasn’t easy.  

 
The HelloBaby Video Monitor is a bit on the cheaper side for a video monitor and video quality is where it’s more frugal nature shows.
 
##   Sound Quality: Unexpectedly good audio  
 

Sound on the HelloBaby Video Monitor caught us off-guard. Despite the video quality being subpar, sound was quite impressive. The audio was clear, the speaker projected the sound well, and overall it worked about as well as our dedicated audio baby monitor. Two-way communication suffered, as tends to be the case with most monitor units, but we didn’t need to speak to our child often, so it wasn’t too much of an issue. 

 
##   Battery Life: Ever so slightly shy of all-day  
 

Unlike many other manufacturers, HelloBaby doesn’t share an estimated battery life of the parent unit or even share the milliamp rating of the battery inside the parent unit. However, we took meticulous notes throughout testing and eventually came to the answer. After more than a month of testing, the average battery life of the parent unit was 8.5 hours when using full video mode and 12 hours if only keeping tabs on the audio.

 

This seems about right compared to other monitors on the market at this price point, but we would’ve liked to see at least another hour or two, as we found the parent unit tended to die out a little bit sooner than we would’ve liked in the evening. HelloBaby does sell extra batteries, which you could swap out, but swapping out and charging batteries every day is going to be a hassle as a busy parent.

 
##   Price: Right for what you get  
 

At $79.99 (MSRP), the HelloBaby Video Monitor is one of the most affordable all-in-one video monitoring systems on the market. It doesn’t have a large feature set or the greatest video quality, but the large screen on the parent unit is a welcomed addition. Overall, you’ll have a hard time finding a video baby monitor with the specs of the HelloBaby at this price point, so if it checks all the boxes, it’s well worth going for. 

 
After more than a month of testing, the average battery life of the parent unit was 8.5 hours when using full video mode and 12 hours if only keeping tabs on the audio.
 
##   Competition: HelloBaby HB32 vs. Babysense Video Monitor  
 

The most obvious competition for the HelloBaby Video Monitor is the Babysense Video Monitor. The Babysense Video Monitor features nearly identical specs, retails for $10 less, and features a very similar design. 

 

Like the HelloBaby monitor, the Babysense Video Monitor features a 3.5-inch LCD display on the parent unit with LED audio indicators at the top and a selection of buttons to the right of the screen. No resolution information is given for either the camera on the infant unit or screen on the parent unit, but based on the information we can find, the two appear to be identical. The BabySense unit does come with an extra add-on wide-angle lens though, which should address some of the issues we had with placing the HelloBaby infant unit. At the same $79.99 MSRP, the two appear to be almost interchangeable, so we don’t think you could go wrong with either choice.

 
Solid bang for your buck.
