Introduction

Windows 8 is considered to be one of the most controversial operating systems of all time. Despite its numerous features, the new interface has proved to be a little bit challenging for some users. Nevertheless, there is a way to improve your Windows 8 experience. The solution comes in the form of media center installation. In this article, we will explore the steps you need to take to revolutionize your Windows 8 experience.

Step One: Identify the Right Media Center

Before we proceed with the installation process, it's essential to choose a media center that suits your needs. There are several media centers out there, and it is crucial to find one that meets your specific requirements. Some factors to consider include features, cost, and compatibility with your system.

Step Two: Download and Install the Media Center

After selecting the right media center for your needs, the next step is to download and install it. Most media centers can be easily downloaded from the internet. However, you should always ensure that you are downloading from a reputable source to avoid downloading viruses, scams, or malware.

Step Three: Configure the Media Center

Once you have installed the media center, you need to configure it to your liking. The configuration process is relatively easy, and most media centers come with a user-friendly interface that makes the task a breeze. During the configuration process, you will be prompted to set up the media center menus, choose your video and audio settings, and select your preferred theme among other things.

Step Four: Add Your Media

Now that your media center is up and running, it's time to add some media. Adding media to the media center is easy, and you can either do it manually or use media library management tools to organize the media into a database. Also, most media centers provide support for various file formats, including pictures, music, movies, and TV shows.

Step Five: Enjoy Your New Windows 8 Experience

Congratulations! You have successfully installed a media center on your Windows 8 operating system, and the final step is to enjoy your new experience. With your new media center, you can watch movies, listen to music, browse images, and even watch TV shows without leaving your computer.

Conclusion

Revolutionizing your Windows 8 experience is easier than you might think. Installing a media center is one of the most efficient ways of enjoying the numerous features that Windows 8 has to offer. The benefits of installing a media center on your computer include improved entertainment and multimedia experience. With the simple steps in this guide, you can easily install a media center on your computer and take your Windows 8 experience to the next level.

If you’re already running Windows 8 Release Preview there is a chance that you may have noticed that in this latest build, Media Center wasn’t included by default, instead it requires a feature upgrade, which will cost you some money when the operating system finally ships. However, for now it still free of charge and you can install Media Center in Windows 8 with a secondary product key supplied by Microsoft — note that the key used for OS installation will not work.
 
## Instructions
 
Now follow these steps to complete this task:
 
1. While in the Start screen, type add features, and then click on Add features to Windows 8.
 
2. Click I already have a product key.
 

 
3. Enter this product key: MBFBV-W3DP2-2MVKN-PJCQD-KKTF7 and then click Next.
 
4. Accept the license terms and then click Add features.
 
You computer will restart a couple of times and then Windows 8 Media Center will get installed, after you log back in to your account a new tile will appear in the Start screen.
 
If you used Windows MC in the past, you already know the benefits: Watch, record, pause and fast-forward live TV, plus the ability to manage all your media with a remote control (or 10-foot experience). However, now the Media Center pack will add the capability to play DVDs, as you may recall Microsoft is taking this feature away from Windows 8.
