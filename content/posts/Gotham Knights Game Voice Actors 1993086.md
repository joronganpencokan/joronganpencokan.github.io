Recently, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment announced the voice actors who will bring the characters of Gotham Knights to life. And it's safe to say that fans are in for a treat. Here's a breakdown of the voice actors and the characters they'll be playing:

Greenwood is an excellent choice for the Dark Knight, and we can't wait to hear him in action.

2. Neil Patrick Harris as Nightwing – Harris is a fan favorite in the geek community, thanks to his roles in How I Met Your Mother, Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, and various animated series. Nightwing is one of the most beloved characters in the Batman universe, and we have no doubt that Harris will do him justice.

3. Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Batgirl – Mbatha-Raw is a rising star with an impressive filmography, including Black Mirror, The Morning Show, and Loki. Batgirl is a formidable hero in her own right, and Mbatha-Raw's casting is sure to add depth and complexity to the character.

4. Troy Baker as Red Hood – Baker is a prolific voice actor who has worked on several video games, including The Last of Us and Bioshock Infinite. Red Hood is a complex and tortured character, and we can't think of anyone better to play him than Baker.

5. Will Friedle as Robin – Friedle is no stranger to the world of superheroes, having played Terry McGinnis in Batman Beyond. Robin is a vital member of the Bat-family, and Friedle's casting is sure to bring energy and humor to the game.

This lineup of voice actors is nothing short of incredible. The game's developers have assembled a dream team of talented actors who are sure to bring the characters of Gotham Knights to life in a way that fans have never seen before.

In addition to these voice actors, Gotham Knights will also feature an original story that takes place after the events of Batman: Arkham Knight. Players will take control of the Bat-family as they protect Gotham from an army of villains that include Mr. Freeze, the Court of Owls, and Bane. The game promises to be an unforgettable experience, and with this lineup of voice actors, it's clear that even the smallest details have been given the utmost care and attention.
