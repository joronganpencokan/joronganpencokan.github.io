Discover the Ultimate Hack to Silence Any Annoying Background Noise in Your Windows 11 Videos!

Windows 11 has proven to be a great update to the previous Windows operating systems with its improved features and capabilities. However, even with innovations like the new Microsoft Teams integration and improved touch controls, background noise can be a major headache during video conferences, meetings, and recordings on your Windows 11 device. But don't fret, as we have discovered the ultimate hack to silence any annoying background noise in your Windows 11 videos!

Step 1: Identify the source of the background noise
The first step in tackling background noise is to identify the source of the noise. This could be the sound of a fan, keyboards, or even external noise from outside your workspace. To identify the sound source, simply listen to your recording or playback and pay attention to what's happening around you and the type of sound you hear.

Step 2: Use the built-in Noise Suppression feature on your Windows 11 device
If you are going to be recording audio or video on your Windows 11 device, you can make use of the built-in noise suppression feature. This feature works by filtering out unwanted sounds that are picked up by your device's microphone. To activate this feature, go to "Settings" and click on "System." From there, select "Sound," and you'll see an option for "Noise Suppression." Click on the slider to turn on the feature.

Step 3: Use a third-party app for added noise reduction
If the built-in noise suppression feature doesn't adequately suppress background noise, you can make use of third-party apps like Krisp or Nvidia RTX Voice. These apps make use of AI-powered noise suppression technology that can detect and eliminate unwanted noise in your recording or playback. Once installed on your computer, these apps are simple to use and provide instant results. Simply launch the app, select your audio input device and turn the noise suppression feature on.

In summary, background noise can be a significant distraction during meetings, video conferences or recordings on your Windows 11 device. By following the steps outlined above, you'll be able to use the built-in noise suppression feature on your device, and if that doesn't work, you can install third-party apps like Krisp or Nvidia RTX Voice to eliminate the background noise in your recordings. So go ahead and give these tips a try, and say goodbye to annoying background noise!
