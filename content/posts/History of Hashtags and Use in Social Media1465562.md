Hashtags have revolutionized the way we share and search for content on social media platforms. In this article, we will explore the shocking evolution of hashtags and how they took over the social media world.

In 2011, Instagram was launched as a photo-sharing app. Hashtags were introduced on Instagram the same year and quickly gained popularity. Instagram users could use hashtags to categorize their photos and increase their visibility.

## Hashtags Enter the Mainstream

In recent years, hashtags have entered the mainstream and have been adopted by businesses and marketers. Brands have started using hashtags as a way to increase their social media presence and reach a wider audience.

Today, the use of hashtags has become a common practice on all social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. They help users to search, discover, and connect with like-minded individuals and communities.

## The Future of Hashtags

Hashtags have come a long way since their inception, and they continue to evolve. In 2020, Instagram introduced the "Challenge" hashtag, which allows users to participate in social media challenges and share their content with the broader community.

As social media platforms continue to evolve, hashtags will likely remain an essential part of our online lives. The future of hashtags may include new features and functionality, such as augmented reality, where users can virtually try products by using specific hashtags.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, hashtags have come a long way since their inception on Twitter in 2007. They have become an essential part of our social media experience and have taken over the online world. As we look to the future, it's exciting to see how hashtags will continue to evolve and shape the way we share and discover content online.

Hashtags are those off-kilter squares with six protrusions pointing in every direction. Why are people using hashtags, and why have these symbols, which have colloquially been referred to as pound signs for decades, become so popular?

 

Most people associate hashtags with social media. These cyber appendages that internet users tack on to keywords are here to stay—at least into the foreseeable future.

 
##   Hashtag History  
 

Metadata tags have been around for quite some time. Tags were first used in 1988 on a platform known as Internet Relay Chat or IRC to group messages, images, content, and video into categories. The purpose is so users can search for hashtags and find content associated with them.

 

In October 2007, Nate Ridder, a resident of San Diego, California, started appending his posts with the hashtag #sandiegofire. He wanted to inform people worldwide about the ongoing wildfires in the area at the time.

 

Blogger Stowe Boyd first called them "hashtags" in a blog post in August 2007. At the time, it was the only thing that showed up in search results when you curiously Googled the term "hashtag."

 

By July of 2009, Twitter formally adopted hashtags, and anything with a # in front of it became hyper-linked. And the move was later accentuated when Twitter introduced "Trending Topics," placing the most popular hashtags on its homepage.

 
##   Using Hashtags  
 

The are several reasons to use hashtags for personal and business applications. On your profiles, it's helpful to keep family and friends abreast of what's going on in your life and the things in which they are most interested in knowing about. While status updates are a means of doing this, hashtags are a means to group certain aspects of your life. For instance, if your family or friends are interested in spreading the word about a cause you're involved in, hashtagging your #cause allows them to find the latest news quickly. And not only about you, but others doing the same.

 

Corporations have created some of the most popular hashtags to promote a specific product or service. Small companies have followed suit, incorporating trending hashtags into their social media presence. It's a way to join in on a conversational topic and to create a new dialogue.

 

Some companies use hashtags to keep up with their competitors' marketing, learning what generates and doesn't generate interest. These meta tags can also be used to talk-up a campaign or spread buzz about an upcoming event.

 
##   The Downside of Using Hashtags  
 

There are a few drawbacks to using hashtags. You don't own them, and there are no rules or guidelines. When you add the hash symbol before a word, it becomes a hashtag, and anyone can grab it and exploit it. It can be troublesome, especially in business, if it's hijacked and used nefariously.

 

For example, McDonald's, which is commonly associated with junk food and obesity (despite their efforts to improve that image), started a #McDStories hashtag that went viral in a negative way. Around 1,500 stories went out from users claiming food poisoning, bad employees, and other complaints. The good news is that only 2 percent of the Tweets that came in were negative, but the press they got from it was enough to sweat about.

 

Many people use hashtags for fun. Some use trending hashtags to share an opinion. Others help organize news stories around major events. And sometimes they're made up on the fly to make a Tweet sound funny.

 

The interpretation and usage are always up to you, like most Twitter lingo, but the basic function of a hashtag is to create a single, organized feed of Tweets around each one.
