You'll Never Believe How Easy It Is To Pass The Presenter Role In Microsoft Teams Meetings!

If you're a frequent user of Microsoft Teams, you know that the platform has a lot to offer. From video conferencing and screen-sharing to file sharing and instant messaging, Teams makes collaboration a breeze. But what about when it comes to passing the presenter role in meetings? Well, the good news is that it's incredibly easy, and you'll wonder why you never knew about it before!

First things first, you need to be in a Teams meeting to pass the presenter role. Once you're in the meeting, you'll see a row of icons at the bottom of the screen. One of these icons says "Participants." Click on it, and a pane will open up on the right-hand side of your screen, showing you all the attendees in the meeting.

Next, find the attendee that you want to make the presenter. Hover your mouse over their name, and you'll see a few options appear. One of these options says "Make a presenter." Click on it, and that's it! The attendee you chose will now have control of the meeting, and they can share their screen, present slides, and so on.

But what if you change your mind and want to take back the presenter role? No problem! Just click on the "Participants" icon again, find your name in the list of attendees, and click the "Make a presenter" button next to your name.

It's that easy! Passing the presenter role in Teams meetings is a simple, straightforward process that you'll get the hang of in no time. So go ahead and give it a try the next time you're hosting a meeting or presenting to a group. We bet you'll be blown away by how easy it is – and your attendees will appreciate the smooth transition too!
