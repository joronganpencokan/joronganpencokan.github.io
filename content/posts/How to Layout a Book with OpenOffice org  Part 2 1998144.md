Revolutionize the Way You Create Books: Master Book Layout Techniques with Openoffice Org Part 2!

In the previous article, we introduced you to the amazing and free open-source software, Openoffice Org, and how it can revolutionize the way you create books. Now, we're back with Part 2, where we will dive deeper into book layout techniques that will take your book's look and feel to professional levels.

Selecting the Right Page Size and Margins

Before starting any layout design, you must select the appropriate page size and margins for your book. Openoffice Org offers a wide range of standard page sizes and margin options to choose from. For instance, if you're creating a novel, you might want to go for A5 or 5.5" x 8.5" page sizes. In contrast, for a textbook, a larger page size such as 8.5" x 11" might be more suitable. Moreover, adjusting the margin settings can alter how your book appears visually. Setting a wider margin can be a good option for modern designs, whereas narrower margins lend themselves better to classic styled books. 

Using Styles

Styles are an essential tool and an efficient way that helps you create a consistent look throughout your book. Rather than having to manually adjust the font size or paragraph spacing throughout your book, by utilizing the styles feature of Openoffice, you can apply set formatting consistently to all parts of your book. Not only will this save time and help maintain consistency in your document but will also provide ease in future modifications, such as adding a Table of Contents.

Adding Headers and Footers

Headers and footers can include helpful information like the book title, author name, page numbers, and copyrights associated with the publication. Openoffice Org makes adding headers and footers easy. By selecting "Insert," then "Header" or "Footer," you can add them to your book. By default, the header appears on every page, and the footer appears at the bottom of each page.

Images and Graphics

Adding images or graphics to your book can make it more interesting and engaging for the readers. Openoffice Org comes with a variety of image and graphic tools that enable you to add images and artwork to your pages. To add an image, simply follow the "Insert" > "Picture" path, and voila! Remember the images should be of high-resolution. You don't want to end up with blurry or pixelated images, which may detract from the overall quality of the book layout.

Wrap up

In summary, Openoffice Org can be a perfect fit for authors who are looking for an uncomplicated solution for creating professional-looking books without spending a fortune. The tips mentioned in this article will help you master the art of book layout in Openoffice. Finally, remember to save your work consistently and check formatting thoroughly during and after the completion of the book's layout!

In the first part of this series, I explained how to prepare an OpenOffice.org document for book layout. In this second part, I am going to highlight some key points raised by some of our readers and also how to properly align page numbers and format paragraphs.
 
There are a couple of things you should consider before proceeding:
 
1. If you are submitting your book to a publisher, they normally do not expect you to format the book or do any typesetting. That is their job. They just want the raw manuscript. In some cases, they may even insist that you use a particular generic font and not change default margins. Make sure you read their submission guidelines.
 
2. One of our readers mentioned that he usually formats his books after he finishes writing. This is undoubtedly the best method in most cases. What we created in Part 1 was a basic template that you can use without any further formatting needed before you start writing. Furthermore, if you are working for the publisher or are the publisher, the author might be someone else. In that case, you will take his or her text and prepare it.
 
## Page Numbers
 
Basic page numbering is very easy in OpenOffice.org.  Just click “Insert -> Footer”, and then click “Insert -> Fields -> Page Number”.  You can then left, center, or right align it. What that will give you is a page number at the bottom of every page (or at the top if you choose “Header” instead of footer).
 
In most non-fiction books, however, the page numbers are right aligned on the recto and left aligned on the verso. The result is that page numbers are always on the farthest ends of the pages away from the spine. The second problem to tackle is that page numbers normally start with the text, whereas the default numbering will start with your title page. This is where OpenOffice.org’s sophistication comes in handy. While it is easy to add page numbers, the available variations are extensive.
 
As I mentioned above, this particular part of layout is something that you must do after the book is completely finished, edited, reviewed, and ready for printing. Otherwise, you will most likely be wasting your time and will have to go back and make changes.
 
1. There are three page layout buttons at the bottom of your window. The first shows you one page at a time. The second shows you pages side-by-side, and the third specifically shows you mirrored pages like that of a book.  Click the third, and you should now have the title page by itself and then two pages mirrored throughout the rest of the document.
 
2. Count the pages preceding your first page of text. In my example, I have six.
 
3. Insert a header or footer. All of your page-number work will be performed there.
 
4. Go to your first page of text before proceeding so that you can see the results. Then, click “Insert -> Fields -> Other”.
 
5. Under “Type”, select “Page”, leave it on “Page numbers”, and “As Page Style”.
 

 
6. This is the important part. Under “Offset” enter the number of pages you just counted with a negative sign in front of it. In my example, I entered “-6”.
 
7. Click “Insert”. If your first page of text now has the number 1, you are good to go. If not, undo and recount until you are satisfied.
 
8. When you are satisfied, click “Close”.
 
9. Click on “Format->””Page”.
 
10. Choose the Header or Footer tab, and un-check “”Same content left/right””.
 
11. Click “”OK”” and scroll down to pages 2 and 3.
 
12. Highlight the number “3” and right align it. Page 2 should still be left aligned.
 
Now all of your pages should alternate their page numbers properly. There is an alternative method of accomplishing this same task.
 
## Paragraph Styles
 
Another beautiful feature of OpenOffice.org is its extensive use of page and paragraph styles. You can even create styles for specific characters. Click on the “”Styles and Formatting”” button or simply press F11, and you will see a sidebar with all of the currently available paragraph styles. You can create a style and format it however you see fit. To begin with a style that is already created, right click on it and then click “New”. This will copy that style and allow you to build from it.
 
This is where you can control indentation, line spacing, alignment (which you will most like want to justify), text flow (books usually hyphenate at the end of lines), fonts, and much more. It is completely up to you or whoever is setting publication guidelines for you.
 
Give your style a name and select the “Next Style” drop-down menu. This allows you to identify which style the next paragraph will use. You could conceivably have two alternating styles or just the same style automatically applied whenever you start a new paragraph.
 
In Part 3, we will cover illustrations, more in-depth style techniques, and export formats.
