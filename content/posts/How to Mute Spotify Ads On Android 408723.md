Now, let's get to the how-to part of this hack. Here are the steps you need to follow to get rid of those annoying Spotify ads:

Step 1: Uninstall the original Spotify app from your Android device.

Step 2: Download the modded version of the Spotify app. You can find the modded version by doing a quick internet search.

Step 3: Install the modded version of the app by following the on-screen instructions.

Step 4: Open the app and enjoy all the premium features of Spotify without any ads.

When it comes to audio streaming, Spotify is the king, with over 155 million premium subscribers alone. However, for the rest of the non-premium Spotify users, ads present an inevitable intrusion into your musical enjoyment. Here is how to automatically mute Spotify ads on Android and prevent them from ruining your mood.
 
## Install the Mutify App
 
Like many ad-neutralizing apps, given that it’s almost impossible to truly block ads on a number of platforms, the Mutify app relies on silencing Spotify ads instead. The app is completely free and easy to use and is free of ads, too. Most importantly, it works as intended!
 
Note: this does not block Spotify’s ads. It only mute ads when it plays.
 
Go to the Google Play Store and select it for install.
 
After it is finished installing, you can open it. However, you have to do something else first in order to make it work properly.
 
## Disable Battery Optimization for Mutify
 
The Mutify app has to work in the background to keep Spotify’s ads silent. This clashes with Android’s default battery optimization feature, clearing apps from actively utilizing your phone’s memory if they have been out of use for a certain time period.
 
Obviously, you don’t want that to happen with Mutify – it would stop working after prolonged listening of podcasts and songs.
 
First, engage your Android’s “Finder search” by swiping your finger up across the screen. This will open the “Finder search” text bar, where you can find all features and apps installed on your phone.
 
Start typing “battery opt” into the search bar, and the search result you are looking for will appear below – “Optimize battery usage.” Tap on that result, then tap on “Optimize battery usage.” Here, you will see a list of all the apps using your phone’s resources.
 
Make sure to select the “All” filtering of apps and then disable the Mutify battery optimization with the slider. If the slider is not blue, it’s not active.
 
## Enable Spotify’s Device Broadcast Status
 
Reserved only for the Spotify regular version, not the lite version, Mutify can only work if Spotify’s “Device Broadcast Status” feature is enabled. Either switch to the Mutify app and tap “Open Spotify” or open the Spotify app and tap on the gear icon in the upper-right corner. This opens Spotify’s settings, where you will see the “Device Broadcast Status” feature.
 
Slide to enable it. The color green on the slider indicates that it is active.
 
## Enable Mutify’s Mute Feature
 
Lastly, after you have completed all the preparation for Mutify to work properly, switch back to it and tap on “I Did It.”
 
Slide the “Mute Ads” slider to enable the ad-silencing app. This will have it always working in the background, intercepting Spotify ads. If you are concerned about its battery drain, it is completely negligible, as it is a very low-memory intensive app.
 
Furthermore, don’t forget to enable Mutify’s dark mode by tapping on its settings icon in the upper-right corner and checking the box “Dark-Only Mode.”
 
Light pixels are one of the main culprits of a shortenened battery charge.
 
## Enjoy Your Newly-Smooth Listening Experience
 
Although Mutify doesn’t make for an uninterrupted listening experience, pauses are superior to aggressive and repetitive ads you don’t have any desire to listen to. Now that you know how to mute Spotify ads on Android, if you are interested in other means of combating unwanted ads, check out these seven apps that do their job well.
