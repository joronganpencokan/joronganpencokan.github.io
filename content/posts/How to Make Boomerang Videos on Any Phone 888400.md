#Unleash Your Inner Instagram Star: Learn How To Make Boomerang Videos on Any Phone

Have you ever seen those mesmerizing and fun videos on Instagram that loop back and forth? If you do, you are probably already familiar with Boomerang videos, a popular feature on this social media platform.

Boomerang videos are short, looping videos that play forwards, then backwards, creating a never-ending loop. They are fun, quirky and a great way to add some movement and interest to your social media posts.

The best part? You don’t need an advanced camera or editing skills to create Boomerang videos. You can make them on almost any smartphone, as long as you have the right tools and techniques.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to make Boomerang videos on any phone, to unleash your inner Instagram star:

##Step 1: Download the Boomerang App

To create Boomerang videos, you need to download the Boomerang App. It's a free app that is available on both the App Store and Google Play.

Once you have downloaded the app, open it on your phone, and you will be ready to start creating some fun Boomerang videos.

##Step 2: Choose Your Subject

When creating a Boomerang video, you will only have a few seconds to capture the right moment. Choose a subject that is eye-catching and will work well for a video that loops back and forth.

Some popular subjects include people jumping, throwing something in the air, or even simply waving at the camera. The more movement there is, the better the Boomerang video will look.

##Step 3: Stay Steady

To create a smooth Boomerang video, you need to keep your phone steady. Use both hands and try to keep the camera as still as possible.

If you are moving while filming, it will create a jerky and choppy effect, which will not look as good when it loops back and forth.

##Step 4: Press Record

Once you have your subject and are ready to go, simply press the record button. The Boomerang video will be a short burst of images that are taken quickly, creating the looped video.

Remember to keep filming for a few seconds after your subject has completed their motion, to allow enough time for the video to loop back around.

##Step 5: Edit and Share

Once you have created your Boomerang video, the app will automatically save it to your camera roll. You can then edit the video further by trimming it down or adding filters.

When you are happy with your Boomerang video, share it to Instagram or any other social media platform. Watch as your followers like and share the fun and looping video.

In conclusion, Boomerang videos are a great way to bring some life and excitement to your social media posts. You don't need any fancy equipment, just your smartphone and the Boomerang app. Follow these easy steps, have fun, and unleash your inner Instagram star today!

Boomerang videos are booming across social media platforms as some of the most sharable content available.  While some apps allow you to create these mini clips from scratch, others turn your old videos into a Boomerang within seconds. This article looks at some of the best apps and methods to create Boomerangs.
 
## What Is a Boomerang Video?
 
Boomerang videos are basically short looping clips that don’t last more than a few seconds. The ability to Boomerang videos was designed initially by Instagram and became wildly popular. 
 
Even if you’re not a user of the photo-centric app, there are many other apps available to make Boomerangs with. Most of them are not difficult to use, so it comes down to which apps have the best features.
 
##  1. Instagram and Boomerang
 
Creating a Boomerang using Instagram on mobile is super easy – you can do it in seconds. The same can be said for Boomerang, which is an independent app from Instagram that basically offers the same functionality outside of Instagram.
 
- In the Instagram app, swipe left in your main feed to bring up the camera.Select the Boomerang option from the menu on the left.

 
- Press the button at the bottom to start recording.

 
- Once the clip is done, you can apply video effects, including Slow Mo and Duo, by pressing the Boomerang icon at the top.

 
- Next, apply filters, stickers and other decorations and press Done.

 
- Press the “Send to” button to send it to friends or post is as your Story.

 
With the Boomerang app, the process is the same (minus the first two steps), although you don’t have the option to add filters or any other kind of decoration to your clip – unless you import it to Instagram.

Facebook owns Instagram, and the two are quite intertwined, so there’s no surprise that the former also offers a Boomerang option through its Messenger app for Android and iOS.
