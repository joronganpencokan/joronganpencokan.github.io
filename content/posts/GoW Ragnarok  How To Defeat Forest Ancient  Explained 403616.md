To defeat your enemy, you must first understand them. The Forest Ancient is a formidable opponent with immense power and strength. It is capable of summoning minions who will fight alongside it and can cause significant damage to your troops. Additionally, the Forest Ancient's health bar regenerates over time, making it even tougher to defeat. Knowing its strengths and weaknesses is crucial to your success.

Section 2: Building the Right Army

Your army is your strongest weapon in the game, and choosing the right combination of troops is essential. When facing the Forest Ancient, it is best to have a mix of ranged and melee fighters, as well as healers to keep your troops alive. Some of the best troops to use include bowmen, swordsmen, and axemen. Ensure that you have a good number of archers to take out the Forest Ancient's minions from a distance.

Section 3: The Right Equipment and Skills

Equipping your troops with the right gear and skills will give you an advantage in the battle. Choose weapons and armor that boost your troops' strength and defenses. Additionally, making sure your troops have the correct skills will improve their attack, defense, and healing abilities.

Section 4: The Ultimate Strategy

Now that you understand your enemy and have the right troops, gear, and skills, it is time to unleash the ultimate strategy. The key is to focus on taking out the Forest Ancient's minions first. Use your archers to target the minions from a distance while your other troops fight off any that get too close. Once the minions are defeated, focus all your troops' attacks on the Forest Ancient. Make sure you have healers to keep your troops alive and continue to damage the Forest Ancient until it is defeated.

Conclusion: 

In conclusion, defeating the Forest Ancient in Gow Ragnarok requires a combination of strategy, equipment, and troops. Understanding your enemy, building the right army, equipping them with the right gear and skills, and focusing on defeating the minions first is the ultimate strategy. So, unleash your inner Viking and crush the Forest Ancient in Gow Ragnarok!

## How to beat Forest Ancient in GoW Ragnarok
 

 
Those who have faced Forest Ancient already once know that its body is impenetrable. However, there are some weak spots that you can target to cause massive damage. Forest Ancient launches projectiles from its chest causing a considerable amount of damage. So, make sure to roll out of the way or shield yourself if there’s an incoming attack. A perfect defense against Forest Ancient is the first step towards beating him in GoW Ragnarok.
 
The next step should be targeting the weaker spot, its open chest. Whenever Forest Ancient is about to launch a projectile through its chest, you will get a small opening wherein you can use Leviathan Axe to hit it. It might take only 2-3 blows of Leviathan Axe to stun the Forest Ancient. This is when you can use the Special R3 attack to cause lethal damage. Repeating it multiple times will result in the defeat of Forest Ancient in GoW Ragnarok.
 
Also, keep a note that this creature launches some orbs that cause damage if you get hit. Although, if it doesn’t, you can pick it up and throw it on the Forest Ancient to stun him.
