You Won't Believe the Hidden Secrets Hiding in Hkey Current Config Hkcc Registry Hive!

The Windows Registry is a database that stores crucial system settings and configurations for Windows operating systems. It's like the brain of your computer, housing all of the essential information that your computer uses to operate. Among the various registry hives, one of the most important and often overlooked is the Hkey Current Config Hkcc registry hive. This article will delve deeper into what this registry hive is all about and why you won't believe the hidden secrets that it holds.

What is the Hkey Current Config Hkcc Registry Hive?

The Hkey Current Config Hkcc registry hive is a volative registry hive. It contains data that belongs to the hardware profile that is currently in use by your system. It holds information that is critical for your computer's hardware and configuration to operate correctly. The Hkcc hive is made up of four subkeys:

1. Hardware Profile - This subkey holds information about the hardware profile currently in use by your computer.

2. CriticalDeviceDatabase - This subkey contains information about critical devices in the system.

3. System - This subkey holds system-wide configuration data.

4. Software - This subkey contains system settings for software programs and applications.

Why are the Secrets in Hkey Current Config Hkcc Registry Hive Surprising?

There are several secrets hidden in the Hkey Current Config Hkcc registry hive that most Windows users are not aware of. These secrets can help you maintain the health and stability of your computer, or they can give you a glimpse of how your computer operates behind the scenes. Here are some surprising facts that you might not know:

1. Your computer has multiple hardware profiles. If your computer configuration is changeable, you might have more than one hardware profile to choose from. The Hkey Current Config Hkcc registry hive holds information about the currently active hardware profile.

2. The registry hive can self-heal. If the Hkcc registry hive becomes corrupted or damaged, it can autonomously recover itself from a backup copy. This is known as Registry Rollback.

3. The Hkcc Registry hive contains information about Plug and Play devices. The Plug and Play manager is responsible for detecting and configuring hardware devices that are connected to your computer. The CriticalDeviceDatabase subkey in the Hkcc hive contains information about the most important devices in your system.

4. You can view your computer's boot history. The Hkcc registry hive stores information about the number of times your computer has booted, the last boot time, and the boot menu configuration.

5. The registry hive can help you troubleshoot system errors. If your computer is experiencing problems, you can use the information stored in the Hkcc registry hive to diagnose the issue. The System and Software subkeys contain information about system settings and configurations for applications.

Conclusion

The Hkey Current Config Hkcc registry hive is a critical component of your Windows operating system. It contains vital configuration data about your hardware and software settings that your computer uses to operate. The hidden secrets in this registry hive are surprisingly useful and informative. By knowing what's stored in the Hkcc registry hive, you can diagnose system errors, view your boot history, and explore how your computer operates behind the scenes. So, take some time to explore the Hkey Current Config Hkcc registry hive and see what secrets you can uncover!



HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG, sometimes shortened to HKCC, is a registry hive that's a part of the Windows Registry. It doesn't store any information itself but instead acts as a pointer, or a shortcut, to a registry key that keeps the information about the hardware profile currently being used.

 

HKCC is a shortcut to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive. More specifically, to that hive's \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\Current\ registry key. It's there that the information is truly stored—HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG just provides a quick way to get there.

 

Therefore, this registry hive really just exists for convenience. It's easier to access the data in the other registry key—to view and modify it—by just going to HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG. Since they contain the same information and are always connected to each other, you can make changes in either location to get the same results.

 
##   How to Get to HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG  
 

Viewable from the top level in Registry Editor, this hive is pretty easy to get to:

 
- Open Registry Editor. A really quick way to do this in all versions of Windows is to execute the regedit command in the Run dialog box or search box.
 - Locate HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG on the left side of the Registry Editor tool.
 - This hive is listed at the bottom of all the other hives, right below HKEY_USERS.
 - Select HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG or do the same to the arrow or plus sign to the left to expand the hive.

 
###   Can't Find HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG?  
 

This hive may be difficult to find if a previous visit to Registry Editor was left on a key deep in the registry. Just collapse any open subkeys (by selecting the arrow or plus sign to the left) until you get back to the list of hives, which is where you'll find HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG.

 

Open Registry Editor. A really quick way to do this in all versions of Windows is to execute the regedit command in the Run dialog box or search box.

This hive is listed at the bottom of all the other hives, right below HKEY_USERS.

 

Select HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG or do the same to the arrow or plus sign to the left to expand the hive.

 
##   Registry Subkeys in HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG  
 

Here are the two registry keys you'll find under this hive:

 
- HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG\SoftwareHKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG\System

 

See Microsoft's Windows Server 2003/2003 R2 Retired Content document for more information on the hardware profile information seen under HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG. You can read about the data in the \CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\ registry key, which is the same as what's found in HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG, on page 6730 of that PDF.

 
##   More on HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG  
 

Like we said above, HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG replicates whatever is found in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\Current\. This means that if you edit anything in the former registry key, it will be reflected in the latter, and vice versa.

 

For example, if you add, edit, remove, or rename anything in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\Current\Software\ key and then exit and reopen Registry Editor (or refresh with the F5 key), you'll see that the change took place immediately in HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG\Software\.

 

You may notice there are multiple registry keys inside HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\. That's because that key is used to hold all the hardware profiles for the whole computer. The reason you only see one hardware profile in the HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG key is that it's only pointing to one of those hardware profiles—specifically, to the one that pertains to the user that's currently logged on.

 
In some versions of Windows, you can create additional hardware profiles from the System link in Control Panel. Select Hardware and then Hardware Profiles.
