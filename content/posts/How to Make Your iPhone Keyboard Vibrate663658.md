Do you ever wish your iPhone keyboard could vibrate while you type? Believe it or not, it’s actually possible! This secret trick will show you how to make your iPhone keyboard vibrate, adding a new level of satisfaction to your typing experience.

Step 1: Access the Settings App

The first step is to open the Settings app on your iPhone. You can do this by tapping on the app icon, which looks like gears turning. Once you’ve opened the Settings app, scroll down until you see the option for “Sounds & Haptics”. Tap on this option to continue.

Step 2: Enable Vibrate on Ring and Silent

In the “Sounds & Haptics” menu, you should see several options that control how your iPhone produces sound and vibration. To enable the keyboard vibration feature, make sure that the “Vibrate on Ring” and “Vibrate on Silent” options are both turned on. These settings determine whether your iPhone will vibrate when you receive a call or a notification.

Step 3: Enable Keyboard Haptic Feedback

Now that you’ve enabled the necessary vibration settings, it’s time to enable haptic feedback for your keyboard. To do this, go back to the main Settings menu and select “General”. Then, scroll down until you see “Keyboard”. Tap on this option to continue.

In the “Keyboard” menu, you should see several options that control the behavior of your iPhone keyboard. Look for the option called “Keyboards”. Tap on this option to continue.

Next, select the keyboard that you want to enable haptic feedback for. If you’re using the default keyboard that came with your iPhone, this will be “English”. If you’re using a third-party keyboard, look for the name of the keyboard in the list.

Once you’ve selected your keyboard, you should see several options that control its behavior. Look for the option called “Haptic Feedback”. By default, this option is turned off. Tap on the switch next to this option to enable it.

Step 4: Enjoy Your Vibrating Keyboard!

Congratulations, you’ve now unlocked the secret trick to making your iPhone keyboard vibrate! Whenever you type on your keyboard, you should feel a subtle vibration in your fingertips. This haptic feedback can be especially satisfying when you’re typing on a touchscreen, making your typing experience feel more tactile and responsive.

This article provides instructions on how to make a keyboard vibrate, via haptic feedback, on an iPhone.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Get Gboard. Go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard > Gboard > Gboard > Allow Full Access.

##   What Is a Haptic on iPhone?  
 

When you type on your iPhone's keyboard, you might hear a clicking sound as you press each key. This is called haptic feedback.

 

Haptics is the touch-based responses your device delivers when you interact with the screen. For instance, you might feel your iPhone vibrate when you tap and hold an image to open it.

 

Many people like the vibrational effect they get from pressing keys on their device's keyboard, however, this is mostly available only to Android users. There's currently no built-in feature to enable it on the iPhone.

 
##   How Do I Make My Keyboard Vibrate?  
 

A workaround is to install a third-party keyboard to replace the default iOS keyboard. There are a few to choose from, but Gboard from Google is a good choice for its great reputation and for being one of the few offering this feature for free.

 
##   How to Enable Keyboard Vibration on Your iPhone  
 
- Download the Gboard iOS app to your device.
 - Open your device settings and tap General.
 - Scroll down and tap Keyboard.
 - Tap Keyboards.
 - Tap Add New Keyboard.
 - Tap Gboard.
 - Tap Gboard again.
 - Tap Allow Full Access > Allow.
 - Open the Gboard app and tap Keyboard settings.
 - Scroll down and tap the button beside Enable haptic feedback on key press so that it turns blue. It should be the only default setting that's turned off.
 - You can now test the keyboard vibration by opening any app that uses the keyboard (like Notes or Messages). Tap and hold down the globe icon in the bottom left of the keyboard to select Gboard. Try typing something to feel your device vibrate as you press each key.
 - Tip
 - You can return to using the default iOS keyboard without deleting your Gboard app. Tap and hold down on the globe icon in the bottom left of the keyboard and select Your Language (Your Country).

 
##   How Do I Turn off the Vibrate When I Touch My iPhone?  
 

To turn off the vibration effect on your iPhone, go to your device settings and tap Accessibility > Touch and tap Vibration so that the button turns from blue to grey. This disables all vibrations on your iPhone.

 
### 
Note
 
Since the latest iOS version doesn't currently support haptic vibration for the keyboard, you'll have to use a third-party keyboard that supports this feature. We recommend Google's Gboard.
 

Download the Gboard iOS app to your device.

 

Open your device settings and tap General.

 

Scroll down and tap Keyboard.

 

Tap Keyboards.

 

Tap Add New Keyboard.

 

Tap Gboard.

 

Tap Gboard again.

 

Tap Allow Full Access > Allow.

 

Open the Gboard app and tap Keyboard settings.

 

Scroll down and tap the button beside Enable haptic feedback on key press so that it turns blue. It should be the only default setting that's turned off.

 

You can now test the keyboard vibration by opening any app that uses the keyboard (like Notes or Messages). Tap and hold down the globe icon in the bottom left of the keyboard to select Gboard. Try typing something to feel your device vibrate as you press each key.

 
### 
Tip
 
You can return to using the default iOS keyboard without deleting your Gboard app. Tap and hold down on the globe icon in the bottom left of the keyboard and select Your Language (Your Country).
 
##   How Do I Change the Vibration Intensity on My iPhone?
