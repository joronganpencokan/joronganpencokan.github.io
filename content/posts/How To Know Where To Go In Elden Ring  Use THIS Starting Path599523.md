With numerous paths to take and hidden secrets to uncover, it's easy to lose your way. That's why we've created this ultimate guide to help you unveil the secret starting path in Elden Ring.

Understanding the World of Elden Ring

Before we delve into the guide, let's talk about what Elden Ring is and what makes it unique. Elden Ring is an action-packed RPG game created by From Software, known for titles such as Dark Souls and Bloodborne. The world of Elden Ring is an open world, filled with mythical creatures, formidable foes, and vast lands waiting to be explored. Each area has a unique lore and history, with hidden secrets that the player can uncover by exploring the world. One of the unique features of Elden Ring is its open-world design, allowing you to take any path you desire.

Choosing Your Starting Path

When you first start the game, you'll be presented with several options for your starting path. Each of these paths has a distinct starting location and skill set. Below is a breakdown of the starting paths available in Elden Ring.

- The Knight: The Knight is a beginner-friendly class with a balanced and versatile play style. They start with a shield and sword, making them ideal for players who prefer a defensive play style.

- The Mage: The Mage’s starting play style is focused on magic, with a variety of spells at their disposal. Mages start with a magic staff and light armor, making them more fragile than other classes.

- The Thief: The Thief is a class with a stealthy play style that focuses on quick strikes and evasion. Thieves start with a dagger and light armor, making them agile and elusive.

- The Barbarian: The Barbarian is a class with a heavy-hitting play style that focuses on brute force. Barbarians start with a large two-handed axe and heavy armor, making them slow but incredibly powerful.

Starting Path Tips and Tricks

Each starting path has its strengths and weaknesses, so it's essential to choose the path that suits your play style. Once you have selected your starting path, you'll be taken to your starting location. Below are some starting path tips and tricks to help guide you through your first few steps in Elden Ring.

- Explore Your Starting Location: Each starting location has hidden secrets, including valuable loot and hidden paths. Take your time to explore, look for hidden paths and triggers, and grab any loot you find.

- Choose Your Battle System: Elden Ring offers two battle systems, a traditional one and a new real-time strategy (RTS) battle system. Choose the one that best suits your play style.

- Take Your Time: Elden Ring is a challenging game, and it's easy to get frustrated. Take your time, learn enemy patterns, and remember that death is not the end. You'll respawn at the last checkpoint, allowing you to try again.

Edlen Ring gives you the freedom of finding your own path and unraveling the story yourself. But there are areas you are better off avoiding in the beginning especially if you are low level. For example, going East from your starting location in Limgrave is a no-no, if you don’t want to make your game difficult right from the beginning. On the opposite spectrum of things, there is a specific path you can follow to get powerful right in the beginning. So today we will look at what we believe is the best starting path in Elden Ring to get OP early.
 
## How to Get OP Early in Elden Ring?
 
To get OP early in Elden Ring you need to follow a specific Game Progress Route to get +4 Weapon, tons of runes, double healing, powerful spirit companion, improved armor, and unlock all important in-game features early.
