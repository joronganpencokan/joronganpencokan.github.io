# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Have a Group Call on Your Amazon Echo Show - Learn the Secret Today!

The Amazon Echo Show is a fantastic device that combines Alexa voice command functionality with a tabletop display for ease of use. One of the most exciting features of the Echo Show is the ability to make video calls with friends and family. But did you know that you can have group calls on your Echo Show as well? It's easy and straightforward, and in this article, you'll learn the secret to making group calls on your Amazon Echo Show.

Step 1: Get Your Echo Show Ready

Before you can start making group calls on your Echo Show, ensure that it's connected to the internet and that you have set up an Amazon account. You also need to have at least one contact in your Alexa contact list to make any call.

Step 2: Open the Alexa App

To initiate a group call, you'll need to use the Alexa app on your smartphone. Open the app and tap on the Communicate icon in the bottom middle of the screen. This will bring up a list of your recent contacts.

Step 3: Select the Contacts You Want

Next, select the contacts you want to include in the group call. You can choose up to six people for group calls. If you haven't added the contact you want to call, you'll need to do it before starting the call.

Step 4: Start the Group Call

Once you've selected your contacts, tap on the "Start group call" button located at the bottom of the screen. Alexa will then initiate the group call.

Step 5: Have Fun

Finally, sit back and enjoy the group call with your friends and family. You can adjust the volume and mute individual members if needed. You can also end the call by saying "Alexa, hang up."

Conclusion

The Echo Show is a great device, and its group call feature makes it even better. With these easy steps, you can enjoy group calls with your loved ones from the comfort of your home. So start making group calls on your Amazon Echo Show today and stay connected with your friends and family.

##   How Does Group Calling Work on Alexa and Echo?  
 

Group calling is a free feature available to everyone who owns a compatible Echo device. It leverages the same technology used for placing calls with an Echo and Alexa’s drop-in feature. The main difference is you have to set up a group in the Alexa app before making a call. Each group is limited to seven people, but you can have as many groups set up as you want. For example, you could create a group for your immediate family, your closest friends, your co-workers, and so on.

 

Open the Alexa app on your phone.

 

Tap the communicate icon (speech bubble) at the bottom of the screen.

 

Tap the person icon in the upper right corner.

 

Tap Add New.

 

Tap Add Group.

 

Tap Enable.

 

Tap the check boxes next to the contacts you want to add to your group, and then tap CONTINUE.

 

Enter a name, and tap CREATE GROUP.

 

Your group is now ready for calls.

 
Tap + on this screen at any time to add new members, or tap edit > remove to remove a member.
 

To initiate a group call, use the voice command Alexa, call (group name).

 

Once you’ve set up a group in your Alexa app, initiating a group call is a simple matter of asking Alexa to start a call on a compatible Echo device. This simple process requires you to say the wake word, call, and the group's name. For example, you might say, “Alexa, call family.”

 

From Discord to Zoom, there are many voice and video calling options out there you can use to keep in touch with groups of family, friends, and co-workers. Each option has its strengths and weaknesses. Some services are expensive or come with only a limited number of free minutes, and most require you to install and set up an app on your computer or phone.
