Unlock The Genius Hack To Merge Playlists On Spotify Like A Pro!

Are you a Spotify user with multiple playlists, but wish there was a simpler way to organize them all together? Look no further! We have a genius hack to merge playlists on Spotify like a pro. 

Spotify is a music streaming service that allows users to create, share, and discover playlists. Playlists can be curated by genre, mood, activity, or any other theme that the user desires. However, managing multiple playlists can be tedious, especially when trying to organize them together. 

The first step to merging playlists is to ensure that all desired playlists have been created. Once playlists have been compiled, the next step is to select the songs that you want to merge into a new playlist. The playlist merge feature on Spotify is only available on the desktop app, so you'll need to use a computer to follow these steps. 

To merge playlists, open the Spotify desktop app and select the first playlist you want to merge. Once the playlist is opened, click on the three dots located at the top of the playlist. On the drop-down menu, select "Select All." This will highlight all of the songs in the playlist. 

Next, right click on the highlighted tracks and select "Add to Playlist." A drop-down menu will appear with a list of your other created playlists. Select the playlist where you want the songs to be merged. 

Repeat these steps for each of the playlists you want to merge. Once all desired songs have been added to the new playlist, you can then rename it and edit it as you see fit! 

While this feature may seem small, it can make a big difference in how you organize and manage your Spotify playlists. It allows you to easily combine similar playlists into one cohesive list, saving you time and effort in the long run. 

In conclusion, by following these simple steps, you can now merge playlists on Spotify like a pro. It may take a bit of initial effort, but the end result will be worth it! Try merging your favorite playlists today and experience a simpler, more organized way of streaming music on Spotify.

Although Spotify lacks a built-in method for combining playlists, it’s still possible to merge two or more Spotify playlists by following a few steps. This article will teach you how to streamline your Spotify playlists using desktop and mobile apps.

 
###

##   How to Combine Two Playlists on Spotify  
 

The easiest way to merge two or more playlists on Spotify is by manually copying over songs from one or more playlists to a new playlist. 

 

Since this method requires selecting all songs at once, it’s only effective on the Spotify desktop app for Windows and Mac. It’s technically still possible on the mobile app for Android, iOS, and iPad, but it’s a tedious process since you can only move one song over at a time on these devices.

 
- Open the Spotify desktop app.
 - Select the playlist you’d like to move songs from.
 - Use the Cmd + A shortcut on your Mac (Ctrl + A on Windows) to select all songs in the playlist. If you’d prefer, you can also hold down the Cmd or Ctrl key and click individual songs from the list.
 - Once you’ve selected all the songs you’d like to move, right-click and select Add to Playlist from the drop-down menu. Click the playlist that should get the added songs.
 - If you’d rather copy songs over to an existing playlist rather than create a new one, you can do this too. Just select the playlist you’d like to move the songs to during the Add to Playlist step instead of selecting New Playlist.
 - Alternatively, press Cmd + C/Ctrl + C to copy all highlighted songs. Open the playlist you’d like to copy the songs over to by searching for it or selecting it from the list on the left side of the screen.
 - With the new playlist open, press Cmd + V/Ctrl + V to paste your songs. They should instantly appear in the new playlist.
 - Repeat this step for each additional playlist you’d like to merge.

 
##   How to Combine Playlists on Spotify Mobile  
 

There are two main ways to combine playlists using Spotify's mobile apps on iOS and Android. The first is to do so manually from the Spotify app itself. However, this method isn't ideal as you can only select one song at a time.

 
The process of merging playlists is nearly identical on Windows and Mac. The screenshots below correspond to the Spotify app for Mac, but Windows-specific commands are noted where appropriate. 
 

Open the Spotify desktop app.

 

Select the playlist you’d like to move songs from.

 

Use the Cmd + A shortcut on your Mac (Ctrl + A on Windows) to select all songs in the playlist. If you’d prefer, you can also hold down the Cmd or Ctrl key and click individual songs from the list.

 

Once you’ve selected all the songs you’d like to move, right-click and select Add to Playlist from the drop-down menu. Click the playlist that should get the added songs.

 
If you’d rather copy songs over to an existing playlist rather than create a new one, you can do this too. Just select the playlist you’d like to move the songs to during the Add to Playlist step instead of selecting New Playlist. 
 

Alternatively, press Cmd + C/Ctrl + C to copy all highlighted songs. Open the playlist you’d like to copy the songs over to by searching for it or selecting it from the list on the left side of the screen.

 

With the new playlist open, press Cmd + V/Ctrl + V to paste your songs. They should instantly appear in the new playlist.

 

Repeat this step for each additional playlist you’d like to merge.

 
Since you’re only copying songs from one playlist to another, your old playlist will remain the same after moving the songs over. If you’d like to get rid of it, you’ll need to delete it manually. You can easily do this by right-clicking the playlist from the left-hand menu and selecting Delete.
 

The better option is to use a third-party tool like Spotify Playlist Merger. This tool uses the Spotify backend system to copy playlists together without having to use the desktop app. Remember that you'll need to give Spotify Playlist Merger permission to access your Spotify account to use it.

 

Below, you'll find instructions on how to merge playlists on mobile using both methods.
