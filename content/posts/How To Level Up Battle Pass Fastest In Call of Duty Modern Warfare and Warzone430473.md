# Unleash the Ultimate Strategy: Level Up Your Battle Pass at Lightning Speed in COD Modern Warfare and Warzone!

For avid fans of Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Warzone, the battle pass is a coveted feature that provides gamers with exclusive rewards, such as new weapons and skins. However, leveling up your battle pass can be a daunting task, requiring hours of gameplay and a lot of effort. Fortunately, there are ways to level up your battle pass at lightning speed, unleashing the ultimate strategy that will help you gain access to all the amazing rewards faster than ever before.

## Define Your Strategy

To begin with, it's essential to define your strategy before embarking on your journey to level up your battle pass. There are two kinds of strategies - a passive strategy and an active strategy.

- Passive Strategy: This involves playing the game as usual, without any specific plan to increase your battle pass level. While this strategy will ultimately lead to leveling up, it can be slow and time-consuming.

- Active Strategy: This involves making a concerted effort to increase your battle pass level by completing specific challenges and missions.

If you want to level up your battle pass quickly, choosing an active strategy is the way to go.

## Play Multiplayer And Warzone Games

Playing multiplayer and Warzone games is one of the fastest ways to level up your battle pass. The more games you play, the more experience points you earn, and the faster you progress through the levels. Playing with a team will also increase the likelihood of winning games, giving you even more experience points.

## Play Hardpoint and Headquarters Games

While all multiplayer and Warzone games provide experience points, Hardpoint and Headquarters games give players the most XP per minute. These game modes require players to stay in a specific area on the map to earn points, resulting in more experiences in a shorter amount of time.

## Weekly Challenges

Completing Weekly Challenges is one of the most effective ways to level up your battle pass. These challenges reward players with a significant amount of experience and often provide exclusive rewards. Each week, new challenges become available, giving players the opportunity to gain even more experience points.

## Weapon Challenges

Weapon challenges can be found in both the multiplayer and Warzone modes. They are completed by using a specific weapon to achieve a set number of kills or headshots. Completing these challenges often rewards players with bonus experience points and exclusive weapon skins.

## Seasonal Events

Taking part in seasonal events such as Christmas, Halloween, and other holidays often provide special challenges and rewards. These events are packed with extra experience and exclusive skins that can help you level up your battle pass quickly.

Now that you have a comprehensive strategy to level up your battle pass, you can unleash the ultimate strategy and unlock all the amazing rewards in COD Modern Warfare and Warzone. By following these tips, you'll find that leveling up your battle pass is faster, easier, and more rewarding than ever before. Happy gaming!

## How To Level Up Battle Pass Fastest In Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Warzone
 
The best and easiest way to get the Captain Price skin is to reach 100 in the tier, now this isn’t easy but there are things that you can do to earn XP faster than just jumping in the games and hoping to win.
 
Sadly, the battle pass progression in Call of Duty Modern Warfare isn’t the same as XP but luckily it is very similar, so all you have to do is aim to earn the highest amount of XP in every match.
 
This means that you will need to stay alive for as long as possible, you should aim to be the last man alive every time you step into the game, but with this, you will also need to rack up a high number of kills.
 
Getting kills increases your XP fast and you will need to level up faster. Along with these above things, look forward to completing as many challenges as you can in each game. These are the highest source of XP farming and will give you a massive boost.
 
You can also try completing Camo challenges and missions in the game to get a boost in your XP, these will be rare so make sure that you do get to them whenever they pop up.
 
There are also free weekends where you will get to take part in these are random events and you cannot determine when they’ll take place so you will have to play the game often enough to know.
 
These free weekends give out double XP points and this will help you level up your tiers while doing nothing special at all.
 
Lastly, and this isn’t going to be a popular choice for many gamers but you can always spend real money to level up your tiers. You can level up one tier for about 150 CoD Coins and you can keep on doing this as many times as you want.
 
This is especially good if you are desperate about wanting the 100 tier bonuses without putting in much effort. Just make sure that you have a lot of money lying around in your bank account before you do this.
 
This is all there is to know about how to level up battle pass quickly in Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Warzone.
