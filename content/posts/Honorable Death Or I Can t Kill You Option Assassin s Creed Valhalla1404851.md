Assassin's Creed Valhalla is a game that immerses players in the beautiful and deadly world of Viking warriors. The game takes place in England in the 9th century, where players take on the role of Eivor, a fierce Viking leader who must make difficult choices to protect her clan and achieve her goals. One of the most heart-wrenching choices in the game comes in the form of an honorable death or sparing your enemy. In this article, we'll explore this choice and the impact it has on the player.

The choice between an honorable death or sparing your enemy is a classic trope in Viking culture. Vikings, who valued courage and bravery above all else, believed that dying a glorious death in battle was the only way to enter Valhalla, the afterlife where the bravest warriors would spend eternity feasting and fighting. However, the game presents players with a situation where this choice is not so clear-cut.

Early in the game, players encounter Kjotve the Cruel, a brutal warlord who murdered Eivor's father. Kjotve is the primary antagonist of the game and players spend a significant amount of time tracking him down and preparing for the final battle. When the time comes, players have the choice of either killing Kjotve or sparing his life. If players choose to spare him, Kjotve swears to leave England and never return, and Eivor's clan earns respect and honor for showing mercy. If players choose to kill him, Eivor delivers a brutal execution- a move that appears to contradict Viking honor and is met with disgust from some of Eivor's closest allies.

The choice between an honorable death or sparing your enemy presents players with a difficult moral dilemma. On the one hand, killing Kjotve fulfills Eivor's desire for revenge and ensures that he will never harm her clan again. However, it also goes against the principles of mercy and honor that Eivor's clan values. Sparing Kjotve, on the other hand, allows players to show mercy and forgiveness, but may leave them vulnerable to attack in the future.

The impact of this choice extends far beyond the final battle with Kjotve. The choice represents a larger moral struggle that players must navigate as they progress through the game. It asks players to consider the value of mercy and forgiveness, even in the face of great evil. It also challenges players to redefine what it means to die an honorable death- is it dying with honor on the battlefield, or is it living with honor and upholding values of integrity and compassion?

In conclusion, the choice between an honorable death or sparing your enemy in Assassin's Creed Valhalla is a complex and thought-provoking one. It asks players to consider their values and principles and make difficult decisions based on those beliefs. Ultimately, the choice players make affects not only the fate of their enemies but also the fate of their own character's honor and reputation. Assassin's Creed Valhalla encourages players to engage in meaningful and challenging conversations about morality, forgiveness, and the true nature of bravery.

Spoiler Alert! You will face the Honorable Death or I Can’t Kill You Option at the end of the Wrath of Druids DLC in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. This will mark the end of the Wrath of Druids DLC in the game. As mentioned you do get to choose between two options. Both of these have varied impacts on the ending. So read ahead at your own risk to find out what option to choose in AC Valhalla Wrath of Druids.
 
## What to choose between Honorable Death Or I Can’t Kill You in AC Valhalla
 
If you choose the ‘An Honorable Death’ option you will basically be asking Eivor to kill the other fighter, Ciara. Another point to note is that it isn’t a cold-blooded murder but rather Ciara offers herself as a sacrifice as no one else can harness the power of the Lia Fail. After this, a cutscene ensues with the King mourning the death of Ciara and destroying the artifact for the safety of Ireland. This will also trigger an epilogue scene.
 
If you select the ‘I Can’t Kill You’ option you already know what it means. Eivor will not kill Ciara. In fact, Eivor will try and convince Ciara to give up her ways for the better. After this Eivor and Ciara will destroy the artifact together after which the same epilogue scene will begin. Ciara makes a choice to go out in exile while King Flann Sinna pleads for forgiveness.
 
There is no right answer to these two options. It is entirely up to you to choose what you want. However, if you want a more peaceful resolution to this you can choose to forgive.
