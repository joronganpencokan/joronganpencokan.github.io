Unleash Devastating Destruction: Top Secrets to Amplify Your Arrows and Bolts in Elden Ring

Elden Ring is one of the most anticipated games of this generation. The game's director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, has promised a unique experience for players which will include open-world exploration, deep lore, and challenging gameplay. Elden Ring allows players to choose their own paths and utilize various weapons to defeat opponents. In this article, we will explore the top secrets to amplify your arrows and bolts in Elden Ring.

1. Choose the Right Bow and Crossbow

Before you tackle the game's challenges, it's important to have the right tools in your arsenal. In Elden Ring, there are various types of bows and crossbows available. Some of the bows include the short bow, longbow, and the dragonbone bow. Crossbows, on the other hand, include the light crossbow, heavy crossbow, and the repeating crossbow. Each of these bows and crossbows has its own specific stats such as the range, damage, and firing speed.

Therefore, it's important to choose the right bow and crossbow that suits your playstyle. If you are a fan of short-range combat, you might find using a short bow more useful. However, if you are a fan of long-range combat, a longbow or a crossbow will be more beneficial.

2. Upgrade Your Bows and Crossbows

In Elden Ring, you can upgrade your bows and crossbows by using various materials such as titanite, chunks of titanite, and slabs of titanite. Upgrading your weapons increases their stats such as damage, range, and firing speed.

It's important to upgrade your weapons as often as possible to increase their efficiency. Upgraded weapons can help you take down enemies faster, survive longer, and overall make the game much easier.

3. Use the Right Arrows and Bolts

In addition to upgrading your weapons, it's important to use the right arrows and bolts. In Elden Ring, there are various types of arrows and bolts such as standard arrows, fire arrows, poison arrows, and Lightning Bolts.

By using the right arrows and bolts, you can increase your damage output and even inflict status effects on your enemies. For example, if you're facing enemies who are resistant to physical damage, elemental arrows like fire and lightning arrows will be more effective.

4. Aim for Weak Spots

It's important to skillfully aim and hit the enemy's weak spots with your arrows and bolts. Targeting the weak spots can be challenging, but once you are able to successfully land a shot, it can deal significant damage.

Some enemies have weak spots on their head, legs or arms. Other enemies have weak spots on their back or sides. Experiment with different positions and angles to find the best angle to hit your target.

5. Use Special Arrows and Bolts for Boss Fights

Boss fights in Elden Ring are notoriously difficult. However, specific arrows and bolts can give you an advantage in these fights. For example, during a boss fight, using elemental arrows like fire and lightning arrows or special bolts like moonlight arrows can be highly effective.

In conclusion, by utilizing the right bow and crossbow, upgrading your weapons, using the proper arrows and bolts, aiming for weak spots, and using special arrows and bolts for boss fights, you can unleash devastating destruction in Elden Ring. Follow these tips and tricks to increase your chances of success in the game.

You should increase the damage of your Arrows or Bolts in Elden Ring, to make the most out of them. Mage builds can use Terra Magicus to significantly boost their damage output. Sadly this is not the case for ranged attackers that rely on using bows or crossbows. But while that might be the case you can still do some things to improve them. So in this guide let us quickly check them.
 
## How to Increase the Damage of your Arrows & Bolts in Elden Ring
 

 
There are two ways to increase the damage of your arrows & bolts in the game.
 
- Using Arrow’s Sting Talisman
 - Upgrading your Weapon

 
Let us learn about both of these methods.
 
### Using the Arrow’s Sting Talisman
 
Arrow’s Sting Talisman gives the player an additional 10% damage when attacking using arrows and bolts. You can find this Talisman at the tower near the Impassable Greatbridge in Caelid. Below is its exact location.
 
- Fast Travel to the Impassable Greatbridge site of grace.
 - Just behind the site, you will find a tower.
 - Head west and on the left side you will find two ladders.
 - Use any of the two to climb up. You will find guards above.
 - Next, use the ladder in the middle to climb up.
 - Once you reach the top of the tower you will find three more guards here. On the right corner of this area, you will find a chest.
 - This chest has the Arrow’s Sting Talisman.

 
### Upgrading Weapons to increase Arrows & Bolts damage in Elden Ring
 
Just like how you would upgrade your other weapons you should also upgrade your bows or crossbows if you plan on using them. You can upgrade your bow from the Smithing table at the Church of Elleh. Alternatively, you can also ask Smithing Master Hewg to upgrade it for you at the Roundtable hold.
 
We tried this method by using the Longbow at the Gatefront site of grace. Basically, we shot the Gaurd behind the site of grace.
 
- Longbow+3 dealt damage of 144, while Longbow+4 did 151 damage. You might find a difference in the damage based on how close or far you are from the guard. We shot him in the body. So where you shoot can also show different results. But whatever you do you should see a difference in damage after the upgrade.

 
Hence you should definitely upgrade the bow that you plan on using in the long run. Use both of these methods to see a noticeable increase in the damage difference.
 
That covers everything you should know about how to increase the damage of your arrows and bolts in Elden Ring. I suggest you check our Elden Ring section for more guides on various topics like builds, boss fights, and more.
