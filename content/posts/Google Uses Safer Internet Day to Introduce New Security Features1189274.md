On February 9th, the world celebrates Safer Internet Day. As we increasingly rely on digital technology for work, school, and entertainment, it's essential to prioritize cybersecurity. Google, one of the world's leading tech companies, has rolled out revolutionary security features to mark the occasion.

Here are some of the ways that Google is stepping up to make the internet safer for everyone:

## Password Checkup Extension

Google's Password Checkup Extension is a free tool that helps users create stronger passwords and avoid common password mistakes. It checks the strength of your passwords and alerts you if any of them have been compromised in data breaches.

This feature was introduced last year, but it has been updated with new features to celebrate Safer Internet Day. You can now use it to scan multiple passwords at once and get personalized feedback on how to improve your password hygiene.

## Enhanced Safe Browsing Protection

Google's Safe Browsing feature has been protecting users from malicious websites for years. Now, they've stepped up its capabilities even further. When you enable Enhanced Safe Browsing, your browser will automatically send Google real-time telemetry data about potentially dangerous websites.

This data helps Google identify and block new threats before they can harm users. It also allows Google to alert website owners about security vulnerabilities so that they can patch them up quickly.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for Nest Devices

Google's Nest devices, like its smart thermostats and security cameras, now support 2FA. This means that users can add an extra layer of authentication to their accounts to prevent hackers from gaining access. By enabling 2FA, users will need to enter a unique code sent to their phone in addition to their password to log in to their account.

## Google Meet Safety Features

With so many people working and learning from home due to the pandemic, video conferencing app Google Meet has become more popular than ever. Google has added new safety features to Meet, such as the ability for teachers to mute all participants in a meeting and control who can share their screen.

Google Meet also supports end-to-end encryption for video meetings, so you can be sure that your conversation is private and secure.

## Conclusion

Google's commitment to creating a safer internet should be commended. With its innovative security features, Google is making it easier than ever for users to protect their sensitive information and stay safe online. On this Safer Internet Day, let's pledge to take our digital security seriously and put these tools to good use.

Google has announced several new and enhanced security features to offer users more online protection.

 

Safer Internet Day is possibly the most appropriate time for Google to reveal its plans for improving user protections across several services, starting with high-risk users. It will be teaming up with various organizations ahead of the 2022 US midterms to expand protections for users it determines to be at greater risk. Said organizations include Veterans Campaign, Womenâ€™s Public Leadership Network, LGBTQ Victory Institute, Latino Victory, and more.

 

Along with improving high-risk user protections, Google will also be rolling out "account-level enhanced safe browsing" sometime in March 2022. The opt-in feature will be accessible through account settings or will appear the next time you perform a Security Checkup, though Google doesn't specify exactly what it will do.

 

Beyond that, Google Fi phone plans will allow you to share your location with family members in real-time (at no added cost) from the Google Fi app, which will be available "soon."

 

Finally, Google One's VPN, which was previously only available to Android users, has begun to roll out for iOS devices. As with Android users, if you want to use the VPN, you'll need to sign up for Google One's 2TB Premium Plan ($9.99 per month or $99.99 per year). You'll also need to go through the iOS Google One app to set it up.

 

Aside from the expansion of Google One's VPN to iOS, which has already begun rolling out, there are no specific dates for any of Google's other planned changes just yet.
