Unlock the Secret to Customizing Your Text with Hidden Windows 11 Symbol Tricks!

Customizing your text is a fun way to add personality to your digital communication. Whether you're sending an email, creating a presentation, or just chatting with friends, adding symbols can make your messages stand out. Windows 11 has hidden symbol tricks that you can use to unlock the full potential of your text customization. Here's how you can do it.

Step 1: Enable the Touch Keyboard

The touch keyboard in Windows 11 is the key to unlocking the hidden symbols. To enable it, right-click the taskbar and select "Show touch keyboard button." This will add a touch keyboard icon to the taskbar, which you can use to open the touch keyboard whenever you need it.

Now that you have enabled the touch keyboard, you can access the hidden symbols. When you open the touch keyboard, click the "123" button to access the special characters. Here, you will find a wide range of symbols, including emojis, arrows, and currency symbols.

Step 3: Create Customized Text

Now that you have access to the hidden symbols, you can create unique text by combining the symbols with letters, numbers, and other symbols. For example, you can use the arrow symbols to create a bullet list, or you can use the currency symbols to add a touch of professionalism to your financial reports.

Step 4: Copy and Paste Symbols

If you frequently use the same symbols, you can save time by copying and pasting them into your text. To do this, simply highlight the symbol and press "Ctrl+C" to copy it, then press "Ctrl+V" to paste it into your text.

Step 5: Save Your Frequently Used Symbols

Finally, you can save your frequently used symbols for quick access. To do this, open the touch keyboard and click on the "!" button. This will bring up a menu of all the symbols available. Click the "Pin" button next to the symbol you want to save, and it will be added to your frequently used symbols list.

On Windows 11, you have two easy ways to insert symbols when writing a document, email, text message, or social media post, and in this guide, we’ll show you how. If you ever wrote anything on your computer, you probably had to use the “ALT” key plus code or search online to insert a symbol (for example, em dash, more than and less than, arrows, and many others), which is very inconvenient.
 
However, Windows 11 (line on Windows 10) comes with the emoji panel that lets you quickly insert symbols and kaomoji (face characters) in addition to emojis, so you don’t have to remember any “ALT” codes or use extra steps. Windows even comes with “Character Map,” which is a legacy application that includes all the symbols you will ever need. 
 
In this guide, you will learn the easy steps to insert symbols and kaomoji in documents, text files, emails, and social media posts on Windows 11.
 
- Insert symbols using emoji panel
 - Insert symbols using Character Map

 
## Insert symbols using emoji panel
 
To insert symbols or kaomoji on Windows 11, use these steps:
 
- Open an app.
 - Use the Windows key + . (period) or Windows key + ; (semicolon) keyboard shortcut to open the emoji panel.
 - Click the Symbols tab. (Or the character face button to access the available kaomoji.)
 - Select the symbols you want to insert.
 - Quick tip: If you can’t find the symbol, you can switch between the different tabs to look into the available symbols on Windows 11, including punctuation, currency, geometric, math, Latin, and language.

 
Once you complete the steps, the symbol will appear in the document, and you use them, the most frequently used will appear in the “most recently used” tab to make it even easier to select them the next time. 
 
Open an app.
 
Use the Windows key + . (period) or Windows key + ; (semicolon) keyboard shortcut to open the emoji panel.
 
Click the Symbols tab. (Or the character face button to access the available kaomoji.)
 

 
Select the symbols you want to insert.
 
## Insert symbols using Character Map
 
You can still use the legacy Character Map app to insert symbols on Windows 11 using these steps:
 
- Open Start.
 - Search for Character Map and click the top result to open the app.
 - Select the symbol you want to use.
 - Click the Copy button.

 
After you complete the steps, you can insert the symbol by right-clicking and selecting the Paste option (or using the Ctrl + V keyboard shortcut).
 
Open Start.
 
Search for Character Map and click the top result to open the app.
 
Select the symbol you want to use.
 
Click the Copy button.
