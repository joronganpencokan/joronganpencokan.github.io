Intro:

Computers have become an essential part of our lives in the modern era, and we use them for a variety of tasks such as work, entertainment and communication. However, our computers' performance can decline over time, and one of the primary reasons for this is the lack of storage space on our primary drive. This often leads to slow application launches and longer boot times. Fortunately, Windows 10 provides the ability to move apps to another drive, which can significantly improve your computer's performance in seconds. In this article, we will show you how to take advantage of this feature and boost your computer's speed.

Step 1: Check the Available Storage Space:

Before moving any apps to another drive, it's crucial to check how much available storage you have on the primary drive. To do this, go to 'Settings' and click on 'System.' From there, select 'Storage' and look at the available space on your primary drive. If you have less than 20% of the free space, it's time to move some apps to another drive.

Step 2: Choose the Drive You Want to Move Your Apps to:

The next step is to choose the drive you want to move your apps to. Ideally, it should be a solid-state drive (SSD) or a faster hard drive to ensure that the application runs more smoothly. You can either use an existing drive or add a new one to your computer and then format it with the NTFS file system.

Step 3: Move the Apps to Another Drive:

Once you've selected the drive, it's time to move your apps to the new drive. To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Go to 'Settings' and click on 'Apps and Features.'
2. Select the app you want to move to the new drive and click on 'Move.'
3. Choose the new drive you want to move the app to and click 'Move.' The app will then start moving to the new drive.

Step 4: Change the Default Install Location:

You can also change the default install location for new apps to the new drive to ensure that they install on the faster drive moving forward. To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Go to 'Settings' and click on 'System.'
2. Select 'Storage' and scroll down to 'More storage settings.'
3. Click on 'Change where new content is saved.'
4. Choose the drive you want new apps to install on and then click 'Apply.'

Conclusion:

Moving apps to another drive is a simple yet powerful method of boosting your computer's speed in seconds. It's also an excellent way to prevent the primary drive from becoming cluttered and slowing down your computer. By following the steps outlined in this article, you'll be able to move your apps to another drive and further optimize your computer's performance. Ensure you always check your primary drive's available space to ensure it does not fall below 20% to ensure your computer is always running optimally.
