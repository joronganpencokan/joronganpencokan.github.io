# Revolutionary Hack Reveals Secret Trick to Invert Display Colors on Your Mac - Saving Your Eyes from Strain and Headaches!

In a world where technology is ubiquitous, it's no surprise that our eyes are constantly strained and we suffer from headaches. Apple has always been a pioneer in providing its users with the best and most innovative solutions. One such solution that has emerged recently is the ability to invert display colors on your Mac, which has become an essential feature for many users.

This revolutionary hack has been around for a while, but most people are unaware of it. Once you know how to do it, inverting display colors on your Mac is a piece of cake. It takes only a few seconds to perform and can save your eyes from strain and headaches.

Inverting display colors on your Mac changes the usual white background to a darker background color, which is especially helpful when you're working in low-light environments. It also inverts the text color to white, making it easier to read. Inverted colors are also significantly less harsh and vibrant, reducing eye strain overall.

To perform this hack, simply follow these steps:

1. Click on the Apple Menu on the top left corner of your screen.
2. Select System Preferences.
3. Click on Accessibility.
4. Click on Display on the left-hand menu.
5. Check the box next to Invert Colors.
6. Your display colors will instantly become inverted.

Voila! It's as easy as that.

With this hack, you can now work for longer hours online without worrying about straining your eyes or getting headaches. Another advantage of inverting display colors is that it can be helpful for users who are color-blind or have vision impairments, making it easier for them to view content on their screens.

Of course, if you need to view colors in their true form, you can easily turn off this feature by following the same steps above and unchecking the box next to Invert Colors.

In conclusion, this revolutionary hack can be a lifesaver for anyone who spends long hours in front of their Mac. It's a simple trick that can make a significant difference in your life, and once you've done it, you won't be able to imagine going back to the old way of doing things. So, try it out and see the difference for yourself! Your eyes will thank you.

Inverting display colors is a common accessibility feature that’s available on nearly every operating system today. macOS also features an option to to do this on your Mac. Using this feature can help you to view text or content that otherwise might place strain on your eyes. Inverting colors is also a neat feature to use at night, because it basically changes all white text on your screen to black – which is comparatively easier to read in the dark.
 
Previous versions of OS X (up to OS X Lion) had a quick keyboard shortcut (Command + Option + 8) enabled by default to allow you to invert the colors of your display, but that’s changed in more recent versions of macOS. The option is still available – it’s just in your Mac’s System Preferences.
 
Follow the steps below to invert the colors of your Mac’s display:
 
1. Open System Preferences on your Mac. You can do this from your Dock or by using Spotlight.
 
2. In System Preferences, click on Accessibility, located in the bottom row.
 

 
Here, you’ll have different options to help you change your Mac’s Accessibility settings to your liking.
 
3. From the pane on the left, click on Display.
 
4. Check the option to “Invert Colors.” You’ll see an immediate change on your display, as all the colors will be inverted.
 
You can also select the option to include an Accessibility shortcut in your Mac’s status bar.
 
Another easy way to instantly access the Accessibility options on your Mac is by pressing the Command  + Option + F5 keys, which will bring up an Accessibility menu similar to the one below.
 
Do note that it’s only the display’s colors that are inverted. If you take a screenshot on your Mac, it’ll remain normal, and the inverted colors won’t show up.
 
It’s that simple. To revert to the normal colors at any time, simply uncheck the box, and you’ll be back to normal.
