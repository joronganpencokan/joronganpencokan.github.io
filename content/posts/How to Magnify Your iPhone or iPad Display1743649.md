Simply drag an app to the far right or left of your iPhone or iPad screen, and it will appear on the TV as a second display.

##   How Do I Turn on Magnifier?  
 

The magnifying glass on iOS or iPadOS is different from a zoomed screen. You can find out how to turn that on in our guide to using the iPhone Magnifier. Magnifying is different from Zooming since it can be called up with a finger gesture and can also be used to magnify things and snag images of them or share them with others.

 
##   How Do I Increase the Zoom on My iPhone?  
 

Another way that you can zoom on your iPhone or iPad is to use the pinch to zoom method. To do this, place your thumb and forefinger on the screen close together and then expand them outward without lifting them. Once you've reached the desired zoom level, you can release your fingers, and the screen will stay temporarily zoomed.

 

The problem with using this method to magnify things on your screen is that it only works in some places and has limited zoom capability. However, when you move away from the expanded screen or place your fingers on the screen wide and then pinch them back together, the screen image returns to its original size. Thus this option is great when you need to zoom in on something or magnify your screen temporarily.
