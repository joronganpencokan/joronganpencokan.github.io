# Windows 11 Firewall Hacks revealed: Learn how to reset Firewall settings to default in just one click!

Windows 11 comes with a built-in firewall that serves as a powerful tool to protect your system from malicious attacks. The Windows 11 firewall is designed to keep hackers at bay and safeguard your data against unauthorized access. But sometimes, you may accidentally or unknowingly change the firewall settings, which could leave your system vulnerable to attacks. In this article, we'll reveal some Windows 11 firewall hacks and teach you how to reset the firewall settings to default in just one click.

# Windows 11 Firewall Hacks

Although the Windows 11 firewall is a powerful tool to protect your system, it's not entirely immune to hacks. Hackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the firewall settings and gain unauthorized access to your system. Here are some of the most common Windows 11 firewall hacks that you should be aware of:

1. Disabling the Firewall: Disabling the firewall is one of the easiest hacks that hackers use to gain access to your system. When the firewall is disabled, all incoming and outgoing network traffic is allowed, including malware and other malicious software.

2. Allowing unauthorized programs: If you allow unauthorized programs to access the internet through the firewall, you're putting your system at risk. Hackers can exploit this vulnerability and use these programs to gain unauthorized access to your system.

3. Creating exceptions: If you create exceptions in the firewall settings for programs that shouldn't have access to the internet, you're weakening the firewall's protection. Hackers can take advantage of this vulnerability and use these programs to gain access to your system.

# How to Reset Windows 11 Firewall Settings to Default

Resetting Windows 11 firewall settings to default is a quick and easy way to ensure that your system is protected against these vulnerabilities. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Start menu and type "Firewall & Network Protection" in the search bar.

2. Click on the "Firewall & Network Protection" option.

3. Click on the "Restore Firewalls to Default" option.

4. Click on "Restore Defaults" to confirm.

Once you've followed these steps, your Windows 11 firewall settings will be reset to default, and your system will be protected against vulnerabilities. It's a quick and easy way to ensure that your system is safe and secure.

# Conclusion
