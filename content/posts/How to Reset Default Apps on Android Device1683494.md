# Revamp Your Android Experience: Simple Trick to Reset Default Apps - You Won't Believe the Results!

As Android users, often we find ourselves stuck with the default apps that come with our devices. Whether it's the default web-browser or music player, these default apps may not always be the best option for us. However, what if we told you there's a simple trick to revamp your Android experience - resetting default apps. You won't believe the results!

## Why Reset Default Apps?

Firstly, let's understand why resetting default apps can be a game-changer for your Android experience. Default apps refer to the apps that are set as the default option for certain actions on your device. For example, if you click on a link, your device will automatically open it in the default web-browser. Similarly, if you ask your Google Assistant to play music, it will use the default music player app on your device.

The issue with default apps is that we often set them up once and forget about them. Moreover, default apps don't always have the best features or user experience. For instance, you may like a third-party browser because it has better ad-blocker features, but your default browser isn't compatible with it. By resetting your default app preferences, you can explore different apps and choose the ones you prefer, enhancing your overall Android experience.

## How to Reset Default Apps?

Now, let's get into the specifics. To reset the default app preferences on your Android device, follow these simple steps:

1. Go to the Settings App on your device.
2. Scroll down and tap on "Apps and notifications."
3. Tap on "Default apps."
4. You'll see a list of actions, such as "Browser app" or "Phone app." Tap on the one you wish to reset.
5. You'll see a list of apps that are currently set as default for that action. Tap on "Clear defaults."

That's it! You've just reset the default app preference for that action on your device. Now, the next time you perform that action, your device will prompt you to choose an app, giving you the flexibility to switch to a different option.

## The Results?

You won't believe the results of resetting default apps. By exploring different apps that you prefer, you can find solutions that work better for you. Whether it's a faster web browsing experience or a music player that has better personalized playlists, the right apps can improve the way you use your Android device. Plus, it's always good to switch things up and try different options, ensuring that you make the most out of your device.

In conclusion, resetting default apps is a simple trick that can completely revamp your Android experience. Try it out, and you'll see the difference for yourself.

Regular Android users often have multiple apps installed that do the same thing. For example, when you open a video, your Android device will ask which app you want to open the video. Alternatively, it may use your chosen default video app to play the video.
Users of Android can select what browser, SMS app, email app, video app, etc., should be used as the default. However, sometimes, users accidentally set the default app, forcing them to reset the default app settings.
