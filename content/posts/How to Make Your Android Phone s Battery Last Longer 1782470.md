Well, we have some good news for you. There is a simple trick that can triple your Android phone battery life.

# The Problem With Android Phone Battery Life
The modern mobile devices have revolutionized the way we communicate and access information. However, one of the significant problems that we often face is that of inadequate battery life. While many premium smartphones boast of impressive specifications, the battery life of these devices can fall short of users’ expectations.

# The Solution to Improve Your Phone Battery Life
The good news is you can triple your Android phone battery life with a simple trick. This method involves tweaking your phone’s display settings. By reducing the screen brightness, you can significantly improve your phone’s battery life. Reducing the display brightness is a simple fix that can help your phone maintain an adequate charge throughout the day.

# What is Screen Brightness and How Does it Affect Battery Life?
The screen brightness setting is responsible for the amount of energy consumed by your phone’s display. When the brightness level is set higher, it requires more energy to produce brighter images. Conversely, by reducing the brightness level, energy consumption decreases, thereby saving battery life.

# How To Adjust Your Screen Brightness to Improve Your Battery Life
1. Go to your phone settings
2. Tap on Display
3. Click on Brightness
4. Toggle the Automatic Brightness option to Off
5. Drag the brightness slider to a lower level
6. Save your changes

# Benefits of Reducing Your Screen Brightness
Reducing the brightness level on your Android phone screen can offer several benefits, including:

1. Improved battery life
2. Reduced eye strain
3. Improved screen contrast, making it easier to read in bright sunlight
4. Reduced likelihood of overheating, which can further damage battery life.

# Conclusion
There you have it, folks. The simple trick to triple your Android phone battery life. By reducing the screen brightness, you can extend your phone's battery life and reduce the number of times you need to charge your device. As a result, your phone’s energy efficiency will improve, making it more efficient and convenient to use. Try this trick today, and you won’t believe the difference it will make!

With every Android update, there is a topic that usually crosses a user’s mind: battery performance. For example, many Galaxy S7 users are experiencing battery issues ever since they received the Oreo update.
 
You may not be suffering from this problem, but you may wonder what you can do to make your phone’s battery last longer. Here are some tips to make your Android phone’s battery last longer.
 
## Disable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi When Not in Use
 
Turning off your device’s Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when you’re not using them will help your battery last longer. If these two features have a low signal, you can bet that they will consume more battery than you’d like. To disable Bluetooth, go to “Settings -> Connected devices” and toggle off Bluetooth.
 

 
To manage your device’s Wi-Fi settings, go to “Settings -> Network & Internet -> Wi-Fi.” To disconnect, toggle off the Wi-Fi option.
 
If you want to forget the network you’re using, tap on the Wi-Fi network you’re connected to, and you’ll have the option to forget the network if you see that it’s giving you problems.
 
### Turn Wi-Fi on automatically
 
In Android Oreo there is a new feature that will turn your Wi-Fi on automatically at a known saved location. This means that you can keep your Wi-Fi off at all times and have it automatically turn on when you are at home or at work.
 
You can access the settings at “Settings -> Netowork & Internet -> Wi-Fi Connection -> Wi-Fi Preferences.” Toggle the “Turn on Wi-Fi automatically” option to ON.
 
## Disable Apps that Run in the Background
 
Keep in mind that if you disable an app from running in the background, you won’t be able to receive any notifications. If you still want to go through with it, go to “Settings > Apps & notifications > App info > Choose an app.”
 
If the app you chose is not optimized for Android Oreo, you should see an option that says Background Activity. Toggle that option off. You can double-check that the app is not optimized by tapping on the Battery optimization option.
 
## Turn on Oreo’s Battery Saver Mode
 
Android Oreo has its own battery saver mode in its settings. To enable it, go to “Settings -> Battery -> Battery Saver.”
 
## Disable Adaptive Brightness
 
Adaptive brightness is one of the reasons why your phone’s battery is draining faster than usual. The feature tries to help, but usually sets the brightness higher than what’s necessary. To turn off this feature, go to “Settings -> Display -> Adaptive brightness.”
 
## Disable Haptic Feedback/Vibrate to Save Battery
 
Your phone is using more power than it needs to when it vibrates. That’s why turning off haptic feedback and the vibrate feature when calls come in is a good idea. How you turn off haptic feedback is going to depend on the keyboard you’re using. For example, I’m using Gboard.
 
To turn the feature off on this keyboard, go to “Settings -> System -> Languages & input -> Virtual keyboard -> Gboard -> Preferences -> turn off vibrate on keypress.”
 
To disable the vibrate feature when a call comes in, go to “Settings -> Sound,” and disable also vibrate for calls. Swipe down a tad bit more and toggle off vibrate on tap as well.
 
## Clear App Cache
 
By clearing the app cache, you’re not just helping to improve your phone’s battery life but its overall performance. To clear an app’s cache, go to “Settings -> Storage -> Other apps choose app -> Clear Cache.” Do note that you don’t have to clear every app cache, just the one that is giving you problems.
 
## Some Classic Battery Saving Tips
 
You may have heard that using a dark wallpaper will also help you save battery life. Having the screen brightness as low as possible and using the light version of apps such as Messenger is also of great help.
 
If you rarely use Google Assistant, turning it off will also help. You can disable it by going to “Settings -> Google -> Search -> Settings -> Phone -> Toggle off Google Assistant.”
 
## Conclusion
 
Android Oreo is full of great features. You should be able to enjoy them wherever you go and not have to wait until your phone charges. With these tips you should notice you don’t have to charge your phone as much as you used to. Did we miss your favorite tip? Share it with us in the comments.
