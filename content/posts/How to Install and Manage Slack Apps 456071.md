# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Supercharge Your Slack Experience with These App Installation and Management Tips!

As one of the most popular communication and collaboration tools for teams, Slack has revolutionized the way we work. With its intuitive interface and robust feature set, Slack has become a critical tool for remote teams looking to streamline their communication and collaboration processes.

While Slack comes with a lot of out-of-the-box functionality, many users don't realize just how much more they can do with the platform by installing and managing third-party apps. In this article, we'll explore how you can supercharge your Slack experience by leveraging the power of the Slack App Directory.

## Installing Apps

One of the most significant benefits of Slack's App Directory is the sheer number of apps available for installation. From project management tools to automation apps, there's a seemingly endless variety of third-party apps to choose from.

To install an app, simply navigate to the App Directory within Slack, find the app you're interested in, and click the "Add to Slack" button. Once installed, the app will be available within your Slack workspace, and you can begin using it to enhance your productivity and collaboration.

## Managing Apps

While installing apps is straightforward, managing them can be a bit more complicated. With so many apps available, it's easy to get overwhelmed and clutter your workspace with tools you're not using.

To avoid this, it's important to regularly review your installed apps and remove any that are no longer relevant. Slack makes it easy to do this by providing a centralized location where you can view and manage all of your installed apps.

To access this feature, click on the "Apps" section within the left-hand navigation menu. From here, you can view all of your installed apps and remove any that are no longer useful. Additionally, you can configure app settings, view usage data, and access support resources.

## Best Practices for Installing and Managing Apps

To get the most out of your Slack experience, it's important to follow best practices when installing and managing apps. Some tips to keep in mind include:

- Only install apps that provide real value to your team. Avoid installing apps just because they seem interesting or trendy.
- Regularly review your installed apps and remove any that aren't being used regularly.
- Be mindful of the permissions and access you grant to third-party apps. Only provide access to the information and resources that are necessary for the app to function.
- Keep app settings updated and review usage data regularly to identify opportunities for optimization.

In conclusion, the Slack App Directory provides a valuable resource for teams looking to supercharge their collaboration and productivity. By installing and managing third-party apps, you can customize your Slack experience to meet your unique needs and improve your team's performance. So what are you waiting for? Head to the App Directory and start exploring the possibilities today!

In just a few short years Slack has quickly become the primary way in which co-workers communicate, some opting to even “Slack” someone (now a verb, like “Googling”), rather than get up from their desk and talk to them in person. But Slack is much more than just a communication platform, and you can expand its services and capabilities with the help of Slack apps and plug-ins.
 
## Installing Slack Apps
 
To start this process, visit the Slack Apps page. Make sure you’re signed in to the workspace you want to install the app on first, however, as each app will only install once per workspace. For example, I have several clients I write for, and each site has their own workspace, so if I install the Google Drive integration while I’m signed in to the Make Tech Easier Slack room, it will only install for MTE and not the rest.
 
Similarly, some apps will only install if you have admin access to that Slack channel, depending on the level of functionality you’re trying to get out of it. For this example, we’ll show you how to install Google Drive (something any level of user can do), and what to do if you want to re-configure the installation or uninstall the app completely.
 
There are two ways the app might be installed. The first is if you simply post a Google Drive link into Slack, the chat application will automatically detect the file type and prompt you to see if you’d like to install the app from their repository.
 

 
The second is to visit the Slack Apps page linked above and search for Google Drive in the search bar seen here.
 
From here you’ll be greeted by a page which details all the various plugin capabilities and benefits you’ll get out of the app
 
To install the app, just click the green “Install” button found on the left side of the window.
 
## Managing Slack Apps
 
Once you’ve installed the apps you want to use, every one will appear as a list underneath the list of contacts in the left bar on your main Slack window.
 
To manage which apps have what permissions (or to remove an app altogether), click on the link labeled “Apps” at the top and then choose the “Manage apps …” option found in the top-left corner.
 
From here you’ll see the complete list of all apps that are currently installed in that workspace. To uninstall a specific app, click on it in the list, and another page will appear.
 
From here, scroll down to the bottom of the feature list, and you’ll see a big red button labeled “Uninstall app:”
 
Click on this, and you’ll be greeted with a confirmation prompt. Choose “Yes” and you’ll be good to go!
 
## Wrapping Up
 
Slack is an amazing program that has made the daily drudge of sorting through email chains a thing of the past and increased productivity across the board. Amazingly, you can increase that productivity even further with the help of the hundreds of Slack Apps and integrations that are being added to the platform every single year!
