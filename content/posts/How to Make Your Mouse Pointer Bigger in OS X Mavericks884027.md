It’s no secret: as we get older our bodies start to change and some things even get worse, such as our eyesight. I’m often guilty of increasing the font on a web page so that I can see better. One thing that often becomes hard to see when you’re browsing the web is the mouse pointer; in some cases it’s definitely smaller than it needs to be, making it hard to find on the screen.
 
If you’re on a Mac, it’s easy to change the size and make your mouse pointer bigger so that it’s perfect for your eyes. Here’s how to do that.
 

 
1. Open System Preferences (via Spotlight or the Apple menu).
 
2. Click on Accessibility (or search for it using the search bar).
 
3. Click on “Display” in the left column (if you’re not there already since it’s the default tab).
 
4. You should see an option that says “Cursor Size” and a slider.
 
You can move the slider to the right to make your mouse pointer as big as you’d like; you will see it changing in real-time. Now, no more squinting!
