What to Know

If you're using Docs from the website, choose some text and then pick a color from the highlighter button.

 

Here's how:

 
- Select the text you want to highlight.
 - Highlighting is sometimes used to mean selecting. If you want to select all the text, go to Edit > Select all or click and drag from one part of the document to another to grab everything in between.
 - Locate the highlighter tool from the menu. It's in the same area as the bold/italic/underline section, to the text color changer's right.
 - If you don't see it, it's hidden in the overflow menu; find it through the three-dotted button on the far right of the menu.
 - Pick a color. The text will immediately become highlighted.
 - If you don't see one from the list that you want to use, select the plus button at the bottom; you can adjust the hue or enter the color's hex value for an exact match.
