The Microsoft Flight Simulator has taken the world by storm and garnered tremendous praise, with its stunning visuals and realistic simulation of flying an aircraft in real-world conditions. Let’s dive into the details of how this game is changing the landscape of the gaming industry.

Heading: The Game

The game was launched in August 2020 and has already amassed a massive following. It allows players to experience the thrill of aviation, taking off from their favorite airports, flying over cities and landscapes, before landing perfectly on the runway. There is a range of aircraft to choose from, including commercial airliners, small private planes, and helicopters. The realistic graphics make the experience incredibly immersive, with the game’s AI engine generating real-world weather conditions, traffic patterns, and landscapes.

Stranded travelers unable to leave their homes during the pandemic have found comfort in the game. Many people have dreamed of flying an airplane at some point in their lives, and the game provides a realistic experience that makes players feel like they are up in the air. Since the game is available on Xbox and PC, it adds a sense of companionship, as players can connect with each other online and fly together, even from different parts of the world. The game’s multiplayer feature allows players to fly with friends, share the cockpit, or fly autonomously in the same airspace.

Heading: Eyes to the Future

The game makers harvested millions of high-resolution images and meteorological data to create a realistic simulation and provide the players with the best experience possible. The game is so advanced that it will generate where wildfires on the west coast are happening, or the location of the hurricane in the Atlantic ocean. Apart from all of that, the game continues to create roughly 2.5 petabytes of image data every day.

Overall, the Microsoft Flight Simulator not only caters to gamers but also provides a sense of relief to stranded travelers.

With the coronavirus pandemic keeping people close to home, some wannabe travelers are turning to Microsoft’s new Flight Simulator 2020 to see new horizons.

Key Takeaways
 
- The pandemic has left travelers grounded, so some gamers are turning to Microsoft’s new Flight Simulator 2020.The game offers realistic details and a full map of the globe.Some planes don’t perform realistically in the game, one pilot says.

 

The latest edition of the venerable flight simulator was launched recently to rave reviews. The game is notable for its realistic graphics and detailed maps; for some, the game offers both an escape from grim headlines and a window to a world now unavailable because of closed borders.

 

"I have noticed more conversations surrounding flight simulators in our gaming groups and social media pages than ever before," Ashley Young, owner of the gaming site Gamer Women, said in an email interview. "Almost daily someone is mentioning the beautiful historical monuments and world landmarks being seen with their flight simulators. A sense of getting over cabin fever, community, gorgeous views, and the excitement of landing seem to add to the appeal of flight simulators since the impact of coronavirus."

Flight Simulator 2020’s big draw is its fully re-created Earth, built with Microsoft’s Bing satellite imagery and Azure cloud computing service. The game allows users to fly over hand-crafted airports, real cities, mountains, and landmarks in 20 planes with unique flight models. Not all areas of the globe are available in equal detail, but the company is working on upgrades.

 

"I think we’re going to get there pretty much everywhere," Microsoft’s head of Flight Simulator, Jorg Neumann said. "Commercial planes don’t fly everywhere, and some areas of the world are considered a little bit more remote. But those are actually the areas I’m going to focus on because you know western Europe and the US is good, right? But we want to focus on other areas because we think people have not been there, aviation hasn’t really gone there."

 

The game is so true to life, in fact, that it's drawing real pilots. Steven Richardson, a private jet pilot, has been playing Flight Simulator 2020 up to ten hours per week since its release. "The best thing about MS Flight Sim is its hyper-realism," he said in an email interview. "It's so realistic that you'll see kids and teens learning to fly with ease because of hours spent playing flight simulators."

Learning to fly in the game doesn’t quite translate to real life, however, concedes Richardson. "Sometimes the flight behavior can be unrealistic and some of the cockpit functions aren't working true to real life," he said. "However, this only affects those that really know a specific aircraft."

 

Gamer Adam Drexler says he turned to Flight Simulator during lockdown because he misses the experience of travel. As a professional basketball player, he was used to a life on the road before the coronavirus. Prone to motion sickness, he says he sometimes actually enjoys the sim more than the real thing.

 

"I love being able to take to the skies and being able to pilot an aircraft," he said in a phone interview. "It’s something normally you would never get to do, but just being able to pick up and go and see and experience flight is special. The feeling of being almost bird-like, it’s a thrilling experience, but also one that's very soothing to the mind."

 

Grounded in real life in Houston, Texas, Drexler said he enjoys visiting New York City via the simulator. "I’ve been to New York a few times, but every time I go it's such a rush," he added. "It’s such a busy experience that I never really get to see how the city is designed or all the buildings."

Armchair pilots like Drexler are looking forward to the day when they can board a real plane. Until then, Flight Simulator 2020 will have to do. Pass the salted pretzels.
