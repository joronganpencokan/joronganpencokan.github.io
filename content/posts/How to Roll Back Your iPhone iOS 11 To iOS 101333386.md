# Revive Your iPhone: Learn The Easy Trick To Roll Back From iOS 11 To iOS 10 Now!

Upgrading to the latest version of iOS can bring tons of new features to your iPhone. However, sometimes the update can cause your phone to become slower or have battery issues, making you regret your decision. If you are one of those who are not satisfied with iOS 11, you may want to consider rolling back to iOS 10. In this article, we will show you the easy trick to do that.

Before we proceed, be advised that rolling back to a previous version of iOS is not recommended by Apple. This method might lead to data loss, and it can also affect the normal operation of your device. Also, only certain devices are supported for downgrading iOS 11 to iOS 10.

Here are the devices that are compatible with this method:

- iPhone 7 and 7 Plus
- iPhone 6s and 6s Plus
- iPad Pro 12.9-inch (first generation)
- iPad Pro 9.7-inch
- iPad air 2
- iPad 5th generation
- iPad mini 4

If you own one of these devices, below is the easy trick to roll back to iOS 10:

Step 1: Back up your device

Before proceeding with the downgrade, make sure to back up all of your device's data, including photos, videos, contacts, and messages. This is important because downgrading to iOS 10 will wipe out all the data from your device.

You can back up your iPhone or iPad using iTunes or iCloud. To create a backup using iTunes, connect your device to your computer, open iTunes, and click on "Back Up Now." To use iCloud, go to your device's "Settings" app, tap "iCloud," click "Backup," and toggle on "iCloud Backup."

Step 2: Download the iOS 10.3.3 firmware

You can download the iOS 10.3.3 firmware file for your device from the internet. Make sure to download the correct firmware for your device or else it won't install.

Step 3: Put your device in recovery mode

To install the iOS 10.3.3 firmware file, you need to put your device in recovery mode. Here's how:

- Connect your device to your computer, and open iTunes.
- Force restart your device by pressing and holding the Home and Power buttons for about 10 seconds. Release both buttons when you see the Apple logo.
- When prompted to activate, connect your device to the computer again, and press and hold the Home button until you see the "Connect to iTunes" screen.

Step 4: Restore your device

In iTunes, you should see a message that says your device is in recovery mode. Click on "OK" and then click "Restore iPhone" or "Restore iPad."

Step 5: Install iOS 10.3.3

Now, iTunes will download and install iOS 10.3.3 on your device. This process may take some time, so be patient.

Once the installation is complete, your iPhone or iPad will be rolled back to iOS 10.3.3. You can restore your device's data from the backup you created earlier.

In conclusion, rolling back to iOS 10.3.3 is not a recommended method by Apple, but it can be your solution if you're not happy with iOS 11. Make sure to back up your device's data before proceeding with the downgrade, and follow the above steps correctly. We hope this article has helped you revive your iPhone!
