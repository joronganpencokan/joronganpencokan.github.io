# You Won't Believe the Amazing New Features and Changes in Windows 10 Build 16251 - Hands On Review!


Windows 10 has come a long way since its release in 2015. With the upcoming release of Windows 11, Microsoft is still improving and adding new features to Windows 10. The latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 16251 has introduced exciting new features that we can all look forward to. We've had some hands-on experience with the new features and changes and here's what we found.


## Windows Console Improvements

The Windows Console is the command-line interface available for Windows users. Microsoft has made significant improvements to the console, including the ability to customize the colors of the console. There's also support for 24-bit RGB colors, which means that you can now use the full spectrum of colors in the console.

Another significant improvement to the console is the ability to zoom in and out, making it easier to read small text. This feature is particularly useful for users who use high DPI displays.


## Dark Mode Changes

Windows 10 Build 16251 has introduced a host of new changes to the Dark Mode feature. The Settings app, the Windows Store app, and the Share flyout now have a dark mode. The dark mode for the Share flyout is especially useful, as it often appears when you're using an app in full-screen mode.

The Microsoft Edge browser is now in sync with the Dark Mode feature. When you have the dark mode enabled, Microsoft Edge will now display web pages in dark mode.


## Eye Control

Windows 10 Build 16251 has introduced Eye Control, a feature that allows you to control certain aspects of Windows with your eyes. Eye Control uses eye tracking technology to detect eye movements, which are then used to control the mouse cursor and perform other tasks.

Eye Control is a significant improvement for users with disabilities who may find it difficult to use traditional input devices like a mouse or keyboard.


## New Cortana Features

The Cortana virtual assistant has received several new features in Windows 10 Build 16251. Cortana now has a new Collections feature, which allows you to collect information from the web and store it in a logical way. You can then access this information later when you need it. 

Cortana can now also speak multiple languages. This is a boon for users who speak more than one language and want to use Cortana in their preferred language.


## Other Changes

Other changes in Windows 10 Build 16251 include improvements to the My People feature. You can now drag and drop files onto a contact icon to share them with that person. There are also new emoji designs in this build, as well as support for named emojis.

Microsoft has also added new cursor sizes and colors, which can be customized by the user.


## Conclusion

Windows 10 Build 16251 has introduced several exciting new features and changes. The improvements to the Windows Console and the Dark Mode feature are welcome additions, as is the Eye Control feature. The new additions to Cortana make it much more useful for users who need assistance with organizing their digital lives. Overall, these new features and changes show that Microsoft is committed to improving the user experience with Windows 10, even as they prepare to release Windows 11. We can't wait to see what other new features and changes are in store for future Windows 10 builds.
