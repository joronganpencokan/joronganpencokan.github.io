However, you can install Google Chrome on a Fire TV Stick by using the Fire Stick app sideloading method. This process involves manually downloading and installing the Google Chrome app installation file.

 

It’s important to note that since the Google Chrome web browser isn’t optimized for working on TVs, the Fire TV Stick remote won’t work with it. A far simpler alternative is to use Google Chrome on another device and mirror that display on your Fire TV Stick.

 
If you choose to use the sideloading process, you will need to use this URL https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/chrome/ to download the Google Chrome web browser.
 

You can cast your display from Android devices, computers, iPhones, and iPads. The process only takes a few seconds, plus you can use your devices to type search terms and website addresses which is much easier than using the Fire Stick remote.
