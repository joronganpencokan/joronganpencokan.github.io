# Unlock the Secret to Cheap and Easy International Calls While Jet-Setting Abroad!

If you are someone who travels frequently and wants to stay connected with your loved ones, making international calls can add a significant cost to your travel expenses. Fortunately, there are several ways to make international calls affordable, easy, and accessible, no matter where you are in the world.

Here are some of the best ways to unlock the secret of cheap and easy international calls while jet-setting abroad:

## Use VoIP Services

One of the best ways to make international calls is to use Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. These services use your internet connection instead of your cellular network, allowing you to make free or low-cost calls to people anywhere in the world. Popular VoIP services include Skype, WhatsApp, and Viber, which are available for free download on your smartphone or tablet.

## Get a Local SIM Card

Another cost-effective solution is to get a local SIM card for your phone when you arrive at your destination. This will save you from high roaming charges and enable you to call and text like a local. You can buy a SIM card from the airport or local shops, and the cost of calls and texts will be significantly lower than using your home network.

## Use International Roaming Plans

If you prefer not to switch SIM cards, your carrier may offer international roaming plans that allow you to use your phone abroad for a reasonable fee. International roaming plans vary by carrier, but most offer data, calls, and texts at discounted rates, so you can stay connected without breaking the bank.

## Download International Calling Apps

Several mobile apps allow you to make calls to international numbers from your mobile phone without Wi-Fi. These apps also offer additional features like video calling, instant messaging, and file sharing. Examples of popular international calling apps include Rebtel, Dingtone, and Vonage Mobile, which can be downloaded for free on your mobile device.

## Use Phone Cards

Another option to make cheap international calls is to purchase phone cards, which are widely available at convenience stores, supermarkets, and gas stations. Phone cards work by calling a local access number and then entering a unique code to access your account. Many phone cards provide low call rates and do not require internet connectivity.

## Final Thoughts

Making international calls does not have to be expensive or complicated. By using VoIP services, getting a local SIM card, using international roaming plans, downloading international calling apps, or using phone cards, you can stay in touch with your loved ones while travelling abroad without overspending on phone bills. So, next time you jet-set, remember to unlock the secrets to cheap and easy international calls and fully enjoy your travel experience!

Options for making international calls while traveling aren't limited to using calling cards and hunting down phone booths. Keep in touch with friends, family, and co-workers while traveling abroad by renting a mobile phone or SIM card, using VoIP applications on your laptop, and, in some cases, using your current cell phone. Here's a look at the pros and cons of these international calling options.

 
##   Purchase a Calling Card  
 

Although it may not be the least expensive method on a per-call basis (depending on the card), and it is less convenient than having a cell phone on you, calling cards are popular with international travelers because they have fixed prices and are familiar to most people.

 
- Easy to budget.
 - Works anywhere with phone access.
 - No unwanted calls while on vacation.

 
- Payphones are disappearing.
 - Reaching you can be difficult.
 - Confusing phone card pricing.

 
##   Bring Your Own Cell Phone  
 

The most convenient option is to bring your current phone with you when you travel abroad. If you have a GSM phone, you'll most likely be able to use it wherever you go. Most of the world (more than 80% according to the GSM Association) operates on GSM.

 
- Most convenient calling option.
 - Contacts and information on your phone travel with you.

 
- Must have GSM technology.
 - Expensive roaming charges.
 - Voicemail may not work.
 - Need adapters to charge the phone.

 

In addition to the extra fees you may incur when using your phone while traveling internationally, the phone must meet these requirements:

 
Mobile service providers may charge high roaming fees. Many providers offer special packages for international travelers that can be set up before your trip.
 
- The phone must be a GSM phone. Although most phones outside of the U.S. are GSM, some Verizon and Sprint phones in the U.S. operate on CDMA cellular technology; these work only in the U.S. T-Mobile and AT&T use GSM phones.The GSM phone must operate on the right band or frequency. U.S. GSM uses the 1.9GHz and 850MHz bands. Europe GSM operates in the 900MHz and 850MHz bands. When traveling internationally, use a tri- or quad-band GSM phone for compatibility. Check with your phone manufacturer to find out if your model has this.

 
##   Rent a SIM Card for Your Cell Phone  
 

If you have a cell phone that meets the technical requirements in the country you're traveling to, avoid data roaming fees from your local carrier by renting a SIM (subscriber identity module) card that works in your destination. This is typically less expensive than using your current provider's international pricing or renting a cell phone.

 
- Typically less expensive than renting a cell phone.
 - Take your current phone on your trip.

 
- Need an unlocked GSM phone.
 - Contacts stored on a SIM card aren't accessible.
 - Uses a different phone number.

 

The GSM tri- or quad-band phone must be unlocked. Most cell phones are unlocked from their networks and most service providers will help you unlock a phone. Locked phones can only be used on the network of the cell phone carrier from whom it was purchased. Search the web to find cell phone unlock codes, hacks, and services.

 
##   Rent a Cell Phone  
 

Though more expensive than renting a SIM card, renting a GSM cell phone that works at your destination allows you to be reachable at all times and to make calls.

 
- Cell phone rentals are available in more than 150 countries.
 - Many international prepaid mobile broadband providers offer international cell phone rentals.
 - Avoid surcharges and extra connection fees.

 
- Contacts and information stored on your phone aren't accessible.
 - Need to give out a new number for people to contact you.
 - Phone choices can be limited, may need to learn to use an unfamiliar phone.

 
##   Use VoIP Calling From a Computer or Phone  
 

Using internet-based phone services such as Skype, which rely on VoIP (voice over internet protocol) technology, can be the cheapest way to make international calls. It might even be free if you use a free Wi-Fi hotspot (are free Wi-Fi hotspots safe?). Using VoIP from an internet café can be relatively inexpensive, but both Wi-Fi hotspots and net café usage depend on your physical presence at a specific location. There are a handful of free VoIP apps that can connect you with the rest of the world.

 
- Can be very inexpensive (even free) using a Wi-Fi connection.

 
- Others can't reach you immediately.
 - May be expensive, depends on the connection.

 

You can also use VoIP on your laptop using prepaid international mobile broadband.
