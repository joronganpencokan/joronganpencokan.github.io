Looking for a new streaming service? HBO Max could be what you need.

 
##   What Is HBO Max? Where Does It Get Shows and Movies?  
 

HBO Max is an on-demand, subscription-based media streaming service from Warner Media Entertainment that features a selection of titles pulled from Warner's massive library of movies and TV shows, in addition to content from other Warner Media brands like HBO.

 

That means it has movies and TV shows produced by Warner Bros. and programming from Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Crunchyroll, TBS, TNT, and more. The service also features exclusive content, like The Flight Attendant, Green Lantern, and the Gossip Girl reboot.

 

In practice, HBO Max is a lot like Netflix, Disney+, and Peacock. It's a streaming service that allows you to watch movies and TV shows on-demand wherever you want.

 

If you're at home, you can stream through their website on your computer or use a streaming device to watch on your television. And if you don't want to be tied down, you can stream to your phone or tablet using the HBO Max app. All you need is a subscription to HBO Max and access to high-speed internet.

 
##   What's the Difference Between HBO Now, HBO Go, and HBO Max?  
 

HBO already had two streaming services before announcing HBO Max, so it's only natural that some people find it a little confusing. Here's what you should know.

 
You don't need a cable subscription, or a subscription to the HBO channel, to access this service.
 

HBO Go was the mobile version of the service for people with HBO subscriptions through their cable providers. HBO Now was a standalone offering for those without existing access to the channel. Neither exists anymore, and HBO Max has replaced them.

 
##   How to Sign Up for HBO Max  
 

You can register for HBO Max through the official website. Here's how.

 
- Navigate to HBOMax.com.
 - Select Sign Up Now.
 - If you subscribe to HBO through a supported provider, you will have access to HBO Max at no extra charge. Select SIGN IN to find out.
 - Select either the plan with ads ($9.99 per month) or without ads ($14.99 per month).
 - To set up an account, fill in your name, email address, and create a password. Then click CREATE ACCOUNT.
 - Next, add a payment method, and follow the prompts to finish.

 
##   What Content Can You Watch on HBO Max?  
 

With an HBO Max subscription, you can stream the entire HBO library, including original series and movies, documentaries, comedy specials, and a rotating library of new and classic movies. If you were an HBO Go or HBO Now subscriber, you'll see all of the same shows and movies you're familiar with on HBO Max.

In addition to shows like Game of Thrones and The Sopranos, HBO Max also includes a massive library of shows from various Warner Media properties and partners, including Rick and Morty, Friends, and The Big Bang Theory. They've also secured streaming rights to shows like South Park and the entire Studio Ghibli library.

 

While most of the content on HBO Max consists of shows that have aired elsewhere, the service also produces original content that isn't available anywhere else. For example, if you want to see what happened after the conclusion of Cartoon Network's Adventure Time or the CW's long-running Gossip Girl, the continuations to both of those series are only available through HBO Max.

 

In line with HBO's decision to bankroll Sesame Street in exchange for timed exclusivity, the service will also include a lot of content geared toward kids, like Looney Tunes: Back in Action movies like My Neighbor Totoro.

 
##   How to Watch HBO Max  
 

The main way to watch HBO Max is through the HBO Max website, which features a streaming media player that works in most web browsers. It also allows users to set up and switch between multiple profiles and includes other features that are more or less in line with other streaming services like Netflix and Disney+.

 
##   Watching HBO Max on Mobile Devices and Televisions  
 

In addition to the website, you can also watch the service through the HBO Max app. The official HBO Max app is available on Android, iOS, and most television streaming devices and services.

 

For instance, you can add HBO Max to a YouTube TV subscription as a standalone channel or add it as part of YouTube TV's Entertainment Plus bundle, which also includes Showtime and Starz.

 

The HBO Max app will allow you to create profiles for multiple users, including protected child profiles, and receive custom recommendations for each user. Instead of relying only on algorithms, you'll actually be able to receive recommendations from people HBO Max refers to as "talent and influencers," including short videos explaining their recommendations.

 

Other features include separate watch lists and recommendations for each user, an interface that HBO Max describes as "swipey," and the ability to download shows and movies for offline viewing.
