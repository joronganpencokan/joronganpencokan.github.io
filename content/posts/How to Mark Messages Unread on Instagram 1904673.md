Are you tired of scrolling through your Instagram DMs, trying to find an important conversation, only to realize you've already opened the message and can't remember what was said? Have you ever wanted to mark a message as unread in Instagram, just like you can in your email client?

Well, you're not alone. Many Instagram users have been searching for a way to mark messages as unread, but until now, there hasn't been an official way to do it.

However, there is a secret Instagram hack that lets you mark messages as unread, and it's been making waves online. In this guide, we'll show you how to use this simple trick to take control of your Instagram DMs and never miss an important conversation again.

## Step 1: Find the message you want to mark as unread

The first step is to find the message you want to mark as unread in your Instagram DMs. You can do this by opening the Instagram app and tapping on the messaging icon in the top right-hand corner.

Once you're in your DMs, find the conversation that you want to mark as unread, and open the message thread.

## Step 2: Swipe left on the message

Next, swipe left on the message you want to mark as unread. This will reveal several options, including "More" and "Unsend."

## Step 3: Tap the "More" option

Tap the "More" option, which should be the first option on the left. This will bring up a list of additional choices, including "Mark as Unread."

## Step 4: Mark the message as unread

Once you've selected "Mark as Unread," the message will be marked as unread, and you'll see a blue dot on the conversation icon indicating that there's a new message waiting for you.

## Step 5: Revisit the message later

Now that you've marked the message as unread, you can revisit it later when you have more time. The next time you open the conversation, you'll see the blue dot next to the message you marked as unread, indicating that you haven't read it yet.

You can also use this feature to remind yourself to reply to a message later. By marking a conversation as unread, you'll be able to keep track of which messages you still need to respond to, without having to remember everything.

## Conclusion

Marking messages as unread in Instagram is a simple hack that can save you time and hassle. With just a few quick steps, you can take control of your Instagram DMs and never miss an important conversation again. Give it a try the next time you're feeling overwhelmed by your inbox, and see the difference it can make!
