If you're a fan of Hitman 3, you're in for a treat with the Mendoza Vineyards mission. Set amongst the beautiful vineyards and rolling hills of Argentina, this mission is not only visually stunning but also packed with hidden secrets for players to uncover. One of the most exciting challenges in this mission is to collect three estate wines. But can you do it? 

Here are some tips and tricks to help you uncover the hidden secrets of Mendoza Vineyards and collect all three estate wines:

1. Explore the Vineyards
The Mendoza Vineyards mission is one of the most expansive and detailed of all the Hitman 3 levels. The first thing you'll want to do is to explore the area. Take some time to walk around, familiarize yourself with the layout, and learn where all the different entrances and exits are. 

2. Blend In
As Agent 47, you'll be moving through a variety of different areas in Mendoza Vineyards. In order to do this successfully, you'll need to blend in with the locals. Make sure you're wearing appropriate clothing and that you're following social cues. If you're not sure what to do, just hang back and observe others, and you'll soon get the hang of it.

3. Look for Opportunities
As you explore Mendoza Vineyards, keep your eyes peeled for opportunities. You never know when you might spot a chance to take out a target or to collect one of the elusive estate wines.

4. Use Your Instincts
Agent 47's instincts are one of his most useful tools. Use them to help you spot useful items, to track enemies, and to find hidden areas.

5. Be Stealthy
As always, stealth is key in Hitman 3. If you're trying to collect all three estate wines, you'll need to be especially careful. Make sure you're staying out of sight, moving quietly, and avoiding detection from guards.

With these tips in mind, it's time to get started on your mission to collect all three estate wines in Mendoza Vineyards. Good luck, Agent 47!

To complete Hitman 3 Estate Wines Discovery Challenge, you have to find and collect three bottles of different wines from the map. Both Cabernet & Malbec can be collected from the reception area. The third bottle of Pinot Noir can be found in a room one floor above the reception.

 
During the Farewell Mission in Mendoza, which takes place in a vineyard, the developers have included this Estate Wines Discovery Challenge to appreciate the value of Mendoza as Argentina’s most important wine region. Mendoza produces almost two-thirds of the country’s wine production.
 
## How to complete Estate Wines Challenge in Hitman 3?
 
Here’s the easy way to complete the challenge:
 
- Once you enter the party, head towards the main reception area.
 - At the right end of the reception table, you will find the first bottle of Malbec.
 - Pick up a bottle, and go to the right where two gentlemen are talking (one in blue and the other in a white suit).

 - Now go outside, and take stairways to one level above the reception.
