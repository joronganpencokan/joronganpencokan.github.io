Transform Your Ubuntu Experience with Nextcloud & Onlyoffice Integration in Just a Few Clicks!

Ubuntu is one of the most popular and highly rated Linux distributions around. It has a lot of features that make it a great choice for people who want a stable, secure, and user-friendly operating system. However, one thing that Ubuntu lacks is an integrated office suite. While Ubuntu comes bundled with LibreOffice, it doesn't quite measure up to what you get from a full-featured office suite like Microsoft Office or Google Docs.

Fortunately, there is a solution that can transform your Ubuntu experience: Nextcloud and Onlyoffice integration. In just a few clicks, you can have a fully functional online office suite that works seamlessly with Ubuntu.

What is Nextcloud?

Nextcloud is a powerful, open-source cloud service that allows you to store, share, and collaborate on your files and documents. It's like having your own personal Dropbox, but with a lot more features and control over your data.

What is Onlyoffice?

Onlyoffice is a cloud-based office suite that provides all the tools you need to create, edit, and manage your documents. It's similar to Microsoft Office or Google Docs, but with a few unique features that make it stand out.

How to integrate Nextcloud and Onlyoffice?

Integrating Nextcloud and Onlyoffice is surprisingly easy. Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Install Nextcloud

You'll need to install Nextcloud on your Ubuntu system first. You can follow the instructions on the Nextcloud website to do this.

Step 2: Install Onlyoffice

Once Nextcloud is up and running, you can install the Onlyoffice app from the Nextcloud app store. Just search for "Onlyoffice" and install the app.

Step 3: Configure Onlyoffice

Next, you'll need to configure Onlyoffice to work with your Nextcloud installation. Go to the Nextcloud admin dashboard and click on "Onlyoffice." From there, you can configure the settings to your liking.

Step 4: Create and edit documents

With Nextcloud and Onlyoffice integrated, you're ready to start creating and editing documents. You can create new documents, edit existing ones, and collaborate with others in real-time.

What are the benefits of Nextcloud and Onlyoffice integration?

The benefits of Nextcloud and Onlyoffice integration are many. Here are just a few of the ways you can benefit:

- Seamless integration: Nextcloud and Onlyoffice work seamlessly together, giving you a complete office suite that works right alongside your cloud storage.

- Enhanced collaboration: With real-time editing and collaboration features, you can work together with others on your documents without worrying about version control.

- Privacy and security: With Nextcloud, you have complete control over your data. You can choose where to store your files and who can access them. Onlyoffice provides strong encryption and advanced security features to keep your documents safe.

- Open-source: Both Nextcloud and Onlyoffice are open-source, which means you can customize them to your liking and take advantage of the many community-contributed plugins and extensions available.

Conclusion

If you're looking to enhance your Ubuntu experience, integrating Nextcloud and Onlyoffice is a great way to do it. With just a few clicks, you can have a complete online office suite that is secure, powerful, and easy to use. Give it a try today and see how it can transform the way you work!

While cloud storage options are numerous these days, most of them put your data in someone else’s hands. Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive all require you to trust the company that owns the service to do right by your data. Fortunately, thanks to software like Nextcloud, it doesn’t have to be that way.
 
Nextcloud, which has its roots in the OwnCloud project, goes above and beyond its original Dropbox-inspired roots. While it stores data, it can also work as a Google Docs-inspired office suite when you add OnlyOffice. With the two combined, you have many of the features of Google’s G Suite, but running on your own server.
 
There are various ways to install and configure Nextcloud, including manual installation, Ubuntu’s Snap system, and Docker. Here we’ll be using a Docker configuration provided by OnlyOffice, since it allows you to install both Nextcloud and OnlyOffice in a few short steps.
 
## Before you get started
 
Nextcloud requires a Unix-like operating system to run, but it says on its website that you can also use the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Here we’ll be focusing on Ubuntu, but the instructions should be similar for other operating systems.
 
## Install docker and docker-compose
 

 
Install Docker with the following command:
 
Next, install Docker Compose:
 
## Installing and configuring Nextcloud
 
Now that we’ve got Docker and Docker Compose installed, we’re ready to move on to Nextcloud itself. We’ll start by cloning the repository:
 
Now we’ll move into the newly cloned directory and fire up the Docker app with the following commands:
 
The second step has a lot to do in order to get Nextcloud running, so be prepared to wait a little bit.
 
Once the process is finished, launch your browser and navigate to your IP address or hostname to finish configuring Nextcloud. If you’re not sure what your IP address is, you can find it with the ifconfig command.
 
Enter the username and password you want to use for your admin account. The Nextcloud server will take a while to get everything up and running.
 
## Installing and configuring OnlyOffice
 
Now we’re most of the way there. Nextcloud is installed and configured, and you’ve had a chance to see the control panel. The final step is to enable OnlyOffice.
 
Back in the terminal, make sure you’re in the same directory from earlier. Run the following command:
 
This will take a while, installing OnlyOffice. Once the command has finished running, log out of and back into the server. OnlyOffice should now be fully configured.
 
Test your new installation by creating a new file. Whereas earlier you had the option to create a simple text file, you should have new options now. Create a new Document, Spreadsheet, or Presentation, and you should see it open in OnlyOffice.
 
## Next steps
 
The major caveat of setting up Nextcloud this way is that you can’t connect over HTTPS with SSL encryption. You can turn on end-to-end encryption in the Nextcloud settings, but you’re still susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
 
The next step would be to set up a reverse proxy, and this can be done with Nginx. The ideal configuration would provide a proxy, not just for Nextcloud, but for any other Docker apps you have running. That’s beyond the scope of this article but should be on your list of things to tackle once you have your Nextcloud server set up.
