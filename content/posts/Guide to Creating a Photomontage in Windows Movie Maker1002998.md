Introduction:

Windows Movie Maker has been a popular video editing software among users for many years. Although movie maker is no longer available as of January 10, 2017, many individuals still continue to use it for their video editing needs. One of the exciting things about Windows movie maker is the ability to create jaw-dropping photomontages. In this guide, you will learn how to create a photomontage in Windows movie maker that is sure to catch the eyes of your audience.

Step 1: Collect your photos:

The first step in creating a photomontage is to collect your photos. Your photos should be of high quality, preferably in JPEG or PNG format. A good rule of thumb is to collect photos that are all related to a particular theme. For instance, if you're creating a photomontage for a wedding, you can collect photos of the bride, groom, the ceremony, decoration, etc. Organize your photos in a separate folder to keep everything organized.

Step 2: Open Movie Maker:

Once you have collected your photos, the next step is to open Windows Movie Maker. You can do this by simply clicking on the Windows button or typing 'windows movie maker' on the search bar located on your taskbar. Once opened, click on 'New Project,' and give your project a name.

Step 3: Import your photos:

After opening a new project, the next step is to import your photos into the software. You can do this by clicking on 'import' located on the top left corner of the screen. A box will appear, click on 'From Folder' and then select the folder where you have stored your photos. After selecting your photos, click on 'Import.'

Step 4: Add your photos to the timeline:

Once you have imported your photos, they will appear in the right part of the screen. To add them to the timeline, press and drag them one by one to the timeline. Arrange them in the order you want them to appear in your photomontage.

Step 5: Edit your photos:

To make your photomontage exciting, you need to edit your photos. Windows Movie Maker offers different editing options such as cropping, adding text, adjusting brightness and contrast, among many others. Simply click on the 'Edit' tab to access these options. You can add text to each photo, and if you want to have a uniform look, use the same font and color throughout the photomontage.

Step 6: Add transitions:

The next step is to add transitions to your photomontage. Transitions are visual effects that occur between two photos. To add transitions, click on 'Animations' located on the menu bar. A list of transition options will appear, such as 'fade in,' 'fade out,' 'crossfade,' among others. Select the transition you want to use and drag and drop it between two photos.

Step 7: Add music:

Adding music to your photomontage will make it more enjoyable to watch. You can add music by clicking on 'Add Music' located on the menu bar. A window will appear, allowing you to browse and select the music you want to use. Remember that the music you choose should match the theme of your photomontage.

Step 8: Save and export:

Once you have created your photomontage, the final step is to save and export it. You can save your project by clicking on 'File' located on the menu bar and then click on 'Save Project.' This will allow you to make further changes to your photomontage at a later time. When you're satisfied with your photomontage, click on 'File' again and then click on 'Export.' Select the appropriate format and resolution for your photomontage and then click on 'Export.'

Conclusion:

Creating a jaw-dropping photomontage in Windows Movie Maker can be an exciting experience. Once you have mastered the steps outlined in this guide, you will be able to create photomontages that are sure to catch the eyes of your audience. Remember, the key to creating an unforgettable photomontage is to choose high-quality photos, have a clear theme, and add transitions and music that tie everything together. Follow the step-by-step approach outlined above, and you'll be able to create photomontages that people will be talking about for years to come.

##   Getting Started in MovieMaker  
 

If you're new to Windows Movie Maker, creating a photomontage is an easy way to get started. In this project you'll learn your way around Movie Maker, and will end up with a video that's fun to watch and share.

 
Windows Movie Maker, now discontinued, was free video editing software. We've left the information below for archive purposes. Try one of these free alternatives instead.
 

To start, collect digital copies of the pictures you're going to use. If the pictures come from a digital camera, or if you already have them scanned and saved on your computer, you're all set.

 

For print photographs, either digitize them at home with a scanner, or take them to a local photo store to have them professionally done. This shouldn't cost too much, and it's worth it if you're dealing with a lot of pictures.

 

Once you have the pictures saved on your computer, open a new project in Movie Maker. From the Capture Video menu, choose Import pictures.

 
##   Select Digital Photos to Import  
 

A new screen will open, allowing you to browse through and select the photos that you want to use. Click Import to bring the pictures into Movie Maker.

 
##   Place Pictures in Timeline  
 

After your pictures have been imported into Movie Maker, drag them to the timeline in the order you want them to play.

 
##   How Long Should the Pictures Play?  
 

By default, Windows Movie Maker sets photos to display for five seconds. You can change the length of time.

 

.

 
##   Apply Video Effects  
 

Apply the effects to the photos by dragging the effect icon and dropping it on the star in the corner of each photo. The star will change from light to dark blue to indicate the effect has been added.

 
##   Ease In and Ease Out of Photos  
 

Adding slight motion to the pictures gives life to your still photos and enhances their impact. You do this by using MovieMaker's  Ease In and Ease Out effects, which slowly zoom in or out of the pictures. You'll find these effects by going to the Edit Movie menu, and choosing View video effects.

 
##   Fade In and Fade Out  
 

Most professional videos begin and end with a black screen. It gives a clean beginning and a definite ending to a movie.

 

You can do this for your video by adding the Fade In, From Black icon to the first picture in your video, and the Fade Out, To Black icon to the the last.

 

These effects are located in the View video effects menu. Add them by dragging and dropping, as you did with the Ease In and Ease Out effects. You'll see a double star on the pictures, indicating two effects have been added.

 
##   Add Transitions Between the Pictures  
 

Adding transition effects between the pictures blends them together, so your video has a smoother flow. In the View video effects menu, under Edit Movie, you'll find lots of different effects, some better than others.

 

You can experiment with different transitions, to find one that gives your photomontage the look you want. I like the Fade effect for its subtlety. It gives a smooth transition between pictures but doesn't call much attention to itself.

 

Add the transition effects to your video by dragging and dropping them between the pictures.

 
##   Finishing Touches  
 

Your photomontage is now complete! At this point, you can export it to a DVD, your computer or the web, using the options in the  Finish Movie menu.

 

Or, if you want to really liven up the pictures, add some music to the video. It's quick and easy to do.
