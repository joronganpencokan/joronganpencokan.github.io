Unlock the Ultimate Power of Your Galaxy Mega 6 3 with This Revolutionary Rooting Method!

Samsung's Galaxy Mega 6 3 is a powerful smartphone with an impressive 6.3-inch screen, 1.5GB of RAM, and a 1.7GHz dual-core processor. However, if you want to get the most out of your device and unlock its full potential, you may want to consider rooting it.

Rooting your Galaxy Mega 6 3 gives you unrestricted access to the Android operating system, allowing you to modify system files, install custom ROMs, and run apps that require root access. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for customizing your device and enhancing its performance.

While rooting may sound intimidating, it's actually a relatively straightforward process. However, it's important to note that rooting does come with some risks. It can void your warranty, and there is always the chance of bricking your device if something goes wrong.

That said, if you're willing to take the risk, here's how to root your Galaxy Mega 6 3 using a revolutionary new method.

Step 1: Enable USB debugging

Before you can begin the rooting process, you need to enable USB debugging on your device. To do this:

- Go to Settings.
- Scroll down and tap About device.
- Tap Build number seven times until you see the message "You are now a developer!"
- Go back to the Settings menu and tap Developer options.
- Scroll down and tap USB debugging.

Step 2: Download the rooting software

Next, you'll need to download the rooting software. For this method, we recommend using KingoRoot, a popular rooting tool that supports many devices, including the Galaxy Mega 6 3.

- Go to https://www.kingoapp.com/ and click on the Windows version of KingoRoot to download the software to your computer.

Step 3: Connect your device to your computer

Once you've downloaded the software, connect your Galaxy Mega 6 3 to your computer using a USB cable. Make sure the device is powered on and has at least 50% battery life.

Step 4: Run the rooting software

Open the KingoRoot software on your computer and click on the "Root" button. The software will begin to analyze your device and install the appropriate drivers.

Step 5: Root your device

Once the software has installed the necessary drivers, click on the "Root" button again. The rooting process may take several minutes, and your device may reboot a few times during the process.

Step 6: Verify root access

Once the rooting process is complete, you should see a message on your computer that says "Root succeeded." To verify that your device has been successfully rooted, you can download and run a root checker app from the Google Play Store.

Congratulations, you've successfully unlocked the ultimate power of your Galaxy Mega 6 3! Now you can customize your device, install custom ROMs, and run apps that require root access. However, remember that rooting comes with risks, so be careful and make sure to back up your data before making any major modifications to your device.

The Galaxy Mega 6.3, like any other Android device from Samsung, is pretty easy to root and only requires the use of ODIN to flash a custom kernel. If you are looking for a simple guide to root your Mega, here is a guide that should get the job done for you. 
Before you proceed further, I recommend you to make backups of all the data present in the phone including your contacts, messages, and installed apps. While rooting the phone won’t wipe your data, it is always good to take precautions.
Keep in mind that the rooting guide below is only meant for the I9205 and I9200 variant of the Mega 6.3.
Step 1: You will first need to make sure that you have all the necessary files and drivers installed on your Windows based PC. If you have KIES installed on your PC, you don’t need to worry about the drivers. If not, you can simply download and install the USB drivers from here. The drivers will work on the 32 and 64 bit versions of Windows 7 and 8.
Also, download ODIN from here and the pre-rooted stock kernel from here.
Step 2: Fire up ODIN and click on the PDA button. Now, navigate and select the pre-rooted kernel that you download in the previous step. Do not touch any other option in ODIN.

Step 3: Switch off your Galaxy Mega 6.3 and re-insert the battery. Now, boot your device into bootloader mode by simultaneously pressing the Volume Down + Home  + Power button. Skip the custom OS warning by pressing the Volume up button.
Step 4: Connect the phone to PC and wait for the required drivers to be automatically installed. Once the drivers are installed, ODIN will detect your device and show a random COM No. Now, just press the ‘Start’ button and wait for ODIN to flash the kernel.
Once the kernel is flashed, your Galaxy Mega 6.3 will automatically reboot into the Android OS. At this point, you can safely disconnect your device from the PC. Keep in mind that the first boot can take up to 2 minutes, so please be patient.
You can confirm whether you have root access or not, by using apps like Root Checker or by simply making sure that SuperSu/SuperUser is installed on your device.
