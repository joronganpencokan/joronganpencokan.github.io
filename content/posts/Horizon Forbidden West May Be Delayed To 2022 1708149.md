Title: Exclusive: Shocking News about Horizon Forbidden West Release Date - May Not Launch until 2022!

Introduction:
Horizon Forbidden West, an upcoming action role-playing game, has been making headlines since its announcement in June 2020. Fans across the world have been eagerly waiting for the game's release, but there's some disturbing news for the gaming community. In an exclusive update, sources have revealed that the game might not launch until 2022.

Body:
Horizon Forbidden West is the sequel to the critically acclaimed open-world game Horizon Zero Dawn. Developed by Guerilla Games, it follows the story of Aloy, a hunter in a post-apocalyptic world populated by robotic creatures. The game was initially announced to be released in late 2021, but recent developments suggest that it might not happen.

According to industry insiders, the development of Horizon Forbidden West has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The work on the game was halted during the lockdown, leading to delays in the development cycle. Moreover, the game's scope has expanded beyond what was initially planned, leading to an extended period of development.

The game has been a highly-anticipated release for Sony, and the company has invested heavily in it. Sony recently acquired a 51% stake in Guerilla Games, indicating its commitment to the project. However, the company has not yet given any official statement regarding the game's release date.

Fans have been eagerly waiting for more information regarding the game, and the news of a possible delay has come as a shock to them. The excitement surrounding Horizon Forbidden West was so high that it was included in the lineup for a recent State of Play event by Sony. However, the event consisted only of updates on already announced games, and no new information was shared regarding Horizon Forbidden West.

Conclusion:
Horizon Forbidden West is one of the most anticipated games of recent times and fans have been eagerly waiting for its release. But with the news of a possible delay, fans may have to wait a little longer. The delay would be disappointing, but in the end, it's better for the game's development to ensure it meets expectations. Sony has not yet made any official announcement, but the industry insiders have suggested a 2022 launch date. Until then, fans will have to wait with bated breath for any further updates on the game's release date.

Hermen Hulst said that Horizon Forbidden West may be delayed to 2022 and won’t release this year-end.
 
## Horizon Forbidden West could be delayed to 2022?
 
Horizon Forbidden West, in particular, could suffer the same fate as the Santa Monica game of God of War: Ragnarok, receiving a plausible delay with respect to the schedule.
 
Hermen Hulst, the current head of PlayStation Studios, recently gave an interview where he touched on several themes including PS5 and PS4, PlayStation Studios vision for PC versions, and much more.
 
For the complete interview you can refer directly to the source, while for the news regarding the game Horizon Forbidden West, we inform you that when he was asked: “How have the teams at PlayStation Studios been able to cope and adapt with these big challenges over the last year?, the current head of PS Studios has provided a rather complete answer, but has also left a statement that portends a possible delay of the title in question. Here is part of the answer focused on the question:
 
So we have, currently, two very big, very narrative-driven games in development: Horizon Forbidden West and the next God of War. And for both of those, they’re frankly affected by access to performance capture and talent. For Horizon, we think we are on track to release this holiday season. But that isn’t quite certain yet, and we’re working as hard as we can to confirm that to you as soon as we can.
 
The rest of the interview is quite complete and has really touched on many topics including the now official postponement of the IP certainly more awaited at Sony, or the new episode of God of War: Ragnarok.
 
In addition, the beloved Kratos was the “victim” of another very interesting news that will surely make the owners of PlayStation 4 happy, namely the release of the game also on the old gen console. Not only GoW, but also Gran Turismo 7, the driving simulator made by Polyphony Digital, will also be released for the same console.
 
The PlayStation exclusives are also becoming a sort of cross and delight for some users who, always fascinated by the games and the exclusivity of the titles on the Sony home consoles have seen some of the most beautiful IPs migrate directly to PCs.
