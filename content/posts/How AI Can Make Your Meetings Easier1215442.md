Revolutionize Your Meetings with the Power of AI - Say Goodbye to Never-ending Talks!

How many times have you sat through a meeting that seemed to go on forever, leaving you feeling drained and inconvenienced? If you're like most professionals, it's probably happened more times than you care to admit. But what if there was a solution to this problem, a way to streamline meetings and keep them focused and productive?

Enter AI, or artificial intelligence. More specifically, AI-powered meeting software that is designed to revolutionize the way we conduct meetings. Imagine having an intelligent virtual assistant that can take care of all the mundane tasks, so you and your team can focus on the ideas and conversations that really matter. Here's what AI can do for your meetings, and why you should consider it for your next business or team meeting:

Start Strong and Set Your Agenda

One of the keys to having a productive meeting is to have a clear agenda. With AI-powered software, it's easier than ever to create an effective agenda that everyone can follow. You can even assign tasks and timelines to individuals, ensuring that everyone knows what is expected of them and what they need to prepare beforehand. A well-planned agenda makes the meeting easier to follow and can help keep things on track.

Real-Time Transcription

Jotting down notes during the meeting can be tricky and distracting. With AI-powered software, you can have a virtual assistant that is programmed to transcribe everything said in real-time. This allows you and your team to stay present and engaged in the conversation, without sacrificing the need for accurate record-keeping.

Automatic Summaries

It can be challenging to gather everyone's ideas and feedback after the meeting. The AI-powered software can generate automatic summaries to capture the main points discussed during the session. This feature is beneficial, especially when there's a need to quickly refer to what was discussed in a previous meeting.

Smart Follow-Ups

After the meeting ends, there's usually a list of follow-up items that need to be addressed. The AI-powered software can generate a smart to-do list for everyone involved, with automated reminders and deadlines. This ensures that progress continues to be made, even after the meeting has ended.

Conclusion

AI-powered meeting software has the power to revolutionize the way we conduct meetings, making them more efficient, streamlined, and productive. By implementing this technology, you can improve the quality of your meetings, making them more engaging and valuable for everyone involved. So why not try it today? Say goodbye to never-ending, mundane meetings and hello to a better, smarter way of conducting business.

There are several advantages to working from home via Zoom: no commute, no pants required, and now, no need to take meeting notes

 
### 
Key Takeaways
 
- Otter transcribes Zoom and Google Meet audio in real time.The paid version can add live subtitles to Zoom calls.Artificial intelligence and machine-learning can even recognize individual speakers.

 

Otter transcribes Zoom and Google Meet meetings in real time, so you can just zone out and read it all later. Or, if you’re the pants-wearing type, then you can follow along and grab those transcribed notes as they happen. Otter isn’t the only tool making it easier to work with audio and video calls, but its advantage is that it works with the video-conferencing apps we’re all using from home. 

 

"Real time transcription, closed captioning, and AI assistant for meetings has been available in Cisco Webex for some time," Samuel Cordery, collaboration technologies expert and head of client experience at Cisco gold partner ITGL, told Lifewirevia Twitter, calling it, "Highly useful."

 

 

 
##   No More Notes  
 

Now that so many of us are working from home, video calls are the most effective way for our employers to waste everybody’s time. Otter is an amazing tool to help get through them. It records audio, transcribes it live, in real time, and lets you search, clip, and highlight the results. There’s a new Chrome extension for recording Google Meet meetings, and there are apps for Mac, iOS, and Android.

 

The app also can record conversations, and import recordings made elsewhere. That means you can transcribe recorded interviews, which is a huge deal for reporters.

 
##   Finally, A Good Use for AI  
 

If you’ve ever had to sit listening to a recorded interview, pausing it while you try to keep up with the typing, you’ll know that transcription always has been a pain. But now, automatic transcription may be good enough that you can forget manually transcribing recorded audio.

 

Not only can these tools get clean text out of audio that is quite noisy—recorded using the voice memos app on your phone, for example—they even can recognize the voices of individual speakers. 

 

Otter is one example of these tools. It lets you generate meeting notes on-the-fly, and without having to actually take notes. It can also generate close to real-time subtitles, with obvious benefits. 

 

Another great piece of transcription software is Descript, which is a powerful app for editing podcasts. It transcribes your audio, and then links the text to the recording. You can cut, copy, paste, and delete the text, and it will automatically rearrange the audio to match.

 

This not only makes editing multi-person audio easy, it has some extremely useful side effects. For instance, you can search for common hesitation and filler words, like “um,” and so on. Then, you can remove them all in a single go, exactly as if you were working with text.

##   User Friendly  
 

We hear a lot about artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and other names for the same thing, and this is where they already are doing useful work. Whenever you open your photo library and see all your friends and family automatically organized into albums, that’s AI. Ditto for searches of your own photos: try searching on "snowman," or "breakfast," or "maps" to see results obtained by machine learning. 

 

AI is a hot buzzword for technology companies, but we’re already seeing the benefits. It’s far from perfect, but the best tools realize this, and give you something that it good enough.

 

Whereas using Apple’s Siri is an exercise in frustration, using tools like Otter, Descript, or the photo search built into your phone, you can quickly perform tasks that would be impossible, or way too time consuming, with almost no effort. Instead of trying to be too clever—like Siri—they get us most of the way to our goal, and we can do the small remaining bits of work required to reach it.
