# Unlock the Secret to Elevating Your Home Decor with Groundbreaking Floor Hacks!

Are you looking for ways to update your home decor without spending a lot of money? Here's a not-so-secret tip: start with your floors. Flooring is often overlooked as a decorative element, but it can make a significant impact on a room's overall style. In this article, we'll explore some groundbreaking floor hacks that will help you elevate your home decor.

## 1. Make a Statement with Bold Patterns

One of the easiest ways to add drama to your flooring is to use bold patterns. You can achieve this in a variety of ways:

- Lay a patterned area rug on top of hardwood floors
- Install patterned ceramic or vinyl tiles in a bathroom or kitchen
- Use patterned carpet in a bedroom or living room

When using patterns, it's important to balance them out with solid-colored furniture and walls. Too many patterns in one space can overwhelm the eye and make the room feel chaotic.

## 2. Experiment with Unconventional Materials

Flooring doesn't have to be limited to traditional options like hardwood, carpet, or tile. Experiment with unconventional materials like:

- Stained concrete
- Cork
- Bamboo
- Reclaimed wood

These materials can give your home decor a unique, eco-friendly touch. Just be sure to research maintenance requirements and durability before making a final decision.

## 3. Mix and Match

Don't be afraid to mix and match different flooring materials in one room. Here are some ways to do this:

- Use hardwood in the main living space and tile in the kitchen
- Combine hardwood with a patterned rug
- Use different types of tiles to create an accent wall or backsplash in the kitchen or bathroom

By mixing and matching flooring materials, you can create a customized, one-of-a-kind look that reflects your personal style.

## 4. Add Texture

Adding texture to your flooring can make a room feel more cozy and inviting. Here are some ways to achieve this:

- Use a shag or plush carpet in a bedroom or living room
- Install textured ceramic or porcelain tiles in a bathroom or kitchen
- Use a patterned, textured rug on top of a hardwood or tile floor

## 5. Update with Paint

Did you know you can paint your floors? This is an inexpensive way to update a room without completely replacing the flooring. Here are some tips:

- Use porch paint or another type of high-quality paint designed for floors
- Sand and prime the floor before painting
- Add a second coat for durability
- Choose a color that complements your existing decor

In conclusion, updating your home decor doesn't have to be expensive or time-consuming. By following these groundbreaking floor hacks, you can elevate your space and make it feel more like home. Just be sure to choose materials and styles that reflect your personal taste and lifestyle. Happy decorating!

Grounded is a nightmare for people with Entomophobia or more commonly the fear of insects. As the protagonist who has shrunk to the size of an ant, you will have to survive the backyard you are in. While being surrounded by insects, you will have to determine the useful ones and stay away from the predators. While food is important for survival, so is building a good base in the game. And any good base has proper flooring in it. Since players are still exploring Grounded, many of them are finding it difficult to unlock and make floors. If you are here for the same, don’t worry as this guide has you covered. So let’s check out this guide and see how to make Floors in Grounded.
 
## How to Make Floors in Grounded
 

 
Floors are important components of any base, whether it is Grounded or any other game. While making floors is quite simple, it is unlocking floors that tend to take you on a small quest. Floors will ensure you a better base and more fortification which is necessary for the game. So here’s how to unlock and make floors in Grounded:
 
- You will have to complete the story mode until you reach the quest where you have to investigate the explosion at the oak tree.
 - Upon investigation, you will locate and unlock the lab near the Oak Tree. While you get inside and reach the room, you will meet the robot BURG.L.
 - The next few steps are quite important if you want to make Floors in your base in Grounded.
 - Alongside the robot, you will get a Grasslands BURG.L Chip which you will give to BURG.L after you interact with him.
 - Next, Select the I Found a BURG.L Chip and then select the I’ll Trade You Some Raw Science option.
 - In the new window, select the Multi-Story Bases option for 1000 Raw Science and you will unlock Floors in Grounded.
 - Now all that is left is going back to the base and making the floors. You will need 4x Grass Planks per panel for flooring.
