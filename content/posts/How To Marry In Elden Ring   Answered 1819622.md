Title: Elden Ring Reveals Secrets To Unlock The Ultimate Marriage Guide – Learn How To Tie The Knot Today!

Introduction:
Elden Ring is a highly-anticipated fantasy game that has caught the attention of gamers worldwide. However, its latest revelation has surprised many as it promises to unlock the ultimate marriage guide that will educate players on the art of tying the knot. Although surprising, the incorporation of a marriage guide in a video game may have been inspired by a desire to bring realism and relevance to the players’ choices in the game's storyline. This article will explore Elden Ring’s incorporation of a marriage guide and how it can teach players invaluable lessons on marriage and commitment.

The Significance of Marriage in the Game
Elden Ring is a role-playing game that is known for its grand adventure and epic storyline. It is set in a world where magic and mythical creatures are part of everyday life. However, it appears that the game also values the significance of marriage as it introduces a marriage guide that teaches players the importance of finding the right partner and building a strong relationship. Players are given the choice to marry a character of their choice, and their decisions have consequences that affect the game's outcome.

Lessons From Elden Ring's Marriage Guide
The marriage guide incorporates several essential lessons that players can apply in their real-life relationships. For instance, players are cautioned against rushing decisions and encouraged to take time to know their partner better before making a commitment. This advice resonates with real-life situations where people jump into relationships without adequately assessing their compatibility and potential longevity.

The marriage guide also emphasizes the importance of communication in a relationship. Players are directed to maintain open and honest communication with their partner, which helps in building trust and promoting intimacy. This guidance is valuable not only in-game but also in real-life, where communication breakdowns can cause serious damage to relationships.

Additionally, Elden Ring's marriage guide teaches players the significance of standing by their partners through thick and thin. In the game, players are given the option to support their partner emotionally and physically, which helps build trust and solidify the relationship. This lesson is vital in real-life relationships, where the ability to support each other through difficult times is a testament to a strong and healthy relationship.

Conclusion:
Elden Ring's incorporation of a marriage guide is indeed surprising but speaks to the game's commitment to realism and relevance. Although it is a fantasy game, it recognizes the importance of marriage and educates players on how to build strong relationships. Its teachings provide valuable lessons that players can apply in their real-life relationships, making it more than just a game but a tool for personal growth and development. Overall, Elden Ring’s marriage guide is a testament to the game's commitment to storytelling, immersion, and realism, making it one of the most exciting and anticipated fantasy games to date.

While a lot of NPCs will remind you of being maidenless in Elden Ring, are you looking to get a wifey in the Lands Between? Melina is one of the first NPCs in the game that will suggest that she can play the role of a maiden. Not to spoil the lore, but Melina will indefinitely not be your maiden. Looking at the world setting and intense storyline of the game, do you think this game allows you to get maidens? No! I am not trying to be White-faced Varre, but to me, it doesn’t suit much to the tone of the game. So, here’s our guide on whether you can marry in Elden Ring or not.
 
## Can you get Married in Elden Ring?
 
The answer to that question is No, you cannot marry in Elden Ring. But there is an option to marry a specific NPC which is Ranni, the Witch. If you progress through Ranni’s questline and trigger a specific ending, you can marry her. Mentioned below are all the steps to trigger that ending. Beware of the upcoming spoilers.
 

 
- You will encounter Ranni for the first time at the Church of Elleh. She will go by the name of Renna and ask if you can summon a torrent horse. She will then reward you Spirit Calling bell and Lone Wolf Ashes to progress through your journey.
 - If you couldn’t talk or find Ranni at the Church of Elleh, you can find her at the Liurnia of Lakes after you defeat Royal Knight Loretta. But this encounter might not reward you with Spirit calling bell and Lone wolf ashes.
 - For the next encounter, head over to Ranni’s Rise located at the Caria Manor. She will be on the topmost floor of the Manor.
 - Choose no particular reason option when she asks why did you arrive here.
 - She acknowledges you and asks if you will join her. Her questline will be triggered if you choose to serve her.
 - You cannot leave Ranni’s Rise until you have spoken to 3 of her close advisors. They are Blaidd, Iji, and the Preceptor Selvius in their astral forms.
 - Once you have started with her questline, progress till you have defeated the Baleful Shadows.
 - This will reward you with a Discarded palace key that you can use to open a chest in Raya Lucaria Academy. This chest will reward you with a Dark Moon Ring.
 - You need to use this Dark Moon Ring to travel to Lake of Rot. As you reach there, you can rest at the Lake of Rot Shoreside, the site of Grace to save your location.
 - Head towards the Grand Cloister located to the south of the Lake of Rot.
 - You will find the physical body of Ranni sitting in a small cave.
 - Go closer to her and interact with her to put on a ring on her finger.
 - Upon wearing the ring, her physical body will be finally free.
 - She will accept you as her Lord and expresses the possibility of meeting again.
 - She will also drop the Dark Moon Greatsword as she disappears into thin air.

 
But this is the last you will hear or meet her. Sounds like a marriage to you? Not to worry, as you can reunite with her for the last time after completing the game. As you complete the game entirely, you will see an option to summon Ranni. Upon summoning her, she will call you dear consort and states that the Age of stars has arrived.
