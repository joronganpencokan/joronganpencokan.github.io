# Never Miss a Beat: Learn How to Keep Your Microsoft Teams Status Available 24/7!

In a world where remote work is becoming more and more prevalent, Microsoft Teams has become an indispensable tool for many businesses. With its numerous features, including video and audio calling, chat, and file sharing, it has made virtual communication easier than ever before. But with its convenience comes the challenge of being always available, which is why it's important to learn how to keep your Microsoft Teams Status available 24/7.

## The Importance of Keeping Your Status Available

Whether you're collaborating with your team members or communicating with your clients, your availability is critical to keeping your project on track. The last thing you want is to miss an urgent message or notification because your status indicated that you were unavailable. By keeping your status available, you'll be able to stay connected with your team and clients and respond promptly to any urgent messages or requests.

## How to Keep Your Status Available

1. **Update Your Status Regularly:** One of the key ways to keep your status available is to make sure it's always up-to-date. If you're stepping away from your desk or taking a break, be sure to update your status accordingly. This lets your team and clients know that you're not available and when they can expect you to be back.

2. **Enable Notifications:** Enabling notifications for Teams ensures that you'll be notified whenever someone sends you a message or mentions your name. This is especially useful if you have a busy schedule or if you're in a different time zone than your team. You can also choose to receive notifications on your desktop or mobile device, so you're always in the loop.

3. **Set Your Status to "Available" by Default:** By default, Teams sets your status to "Available" when you're online. If you're not comfortable with that, you can change it to whatever status you prefer. However, keeping your status as "Available" by default is a good way to let your team and clients know that you're ready and able to communicate.

4. **Use the "Do Not Disturb" Feature When Necessary:** Sometimes, you may need to focus on a particular task or project without any distractions. In those instances, you can use the "Do Not Disturb" feature to let your team and clients know that you're unavailable. You can also set it to turn on automatically during specific hours, like when you're sleeping.

## Final Thoughts

Keeping your status available is essential to maintaining open communication with your team and clients. With these tips, you'll be able to ensure that you're always in the loop, even when you're not at your desk. By staying on top of your Microsoft Teams Status, you can be sure that you'll never miss a beat.
