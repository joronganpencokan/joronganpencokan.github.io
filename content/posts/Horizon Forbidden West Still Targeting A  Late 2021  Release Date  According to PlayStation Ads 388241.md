In the past few days, rumors have spread that the action role-playing game Horizon Forbidden West could also be one of the titles that have been delayed to 2022 due to COVID-19. A current PlayStation advertisement still speaks of a release this year.
 
In the past few weeks, the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated move to the home office meant that several major titles were postponed until next year. Including the fantasy adventure Hogwarts Legacy or the PlayStation 5-exclusive racing game Gran Turismo 7.
 
A few days ago we received the rumor that the action role-playing game Horizon Forbidden West developed by Guerrilla Games could also be one of the titles that will not release until 2022. This is what an insider who is considered a reliable source wanted us to know.
 
However, according to a recent PlayStation ad, this is not the case. This not only lists Housemarque’s new action title Returnal with the current release date in the form of April 30, 2021, but the said advertisement also confirms Horizon Forbidden West for a release this year. Even if for “late 2021.”
 
So we can assume that Guerrilla Games and Sony Interactive Entertainment will continue to aim for a release this year. An official denial of the rumors of a possible postponement to the year 2022 is still a long time coming.
 
Horizon 2 is in development for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 and once again focuses on the protagonist Aloy. The playful innovations of the second part include the possibility to explore underwater sections.
