Master the Art of Book Layout with OpenOffice Org in Just Three Simple Steps!

A beautifully designed book can instantly attract readers and convey a sense of professionalism and attention to detail. If you're an author or self-publisher, you may not have the budget to hire a professional designer, but you can still create a stunning layout for your book with OpenOffice Org. Here are three simple steps to help you master the art of book layout:

Step 1 – Plan Your Layout

Before you start designing your book, you need to plan the layout. This involves making decisions about the size of your book, the type of font you want to use, and the spacing between paragraphs and lines. You also need to decide on the margins, headers, footers, and the overall structure of your page. Once you have a clear idea of the layout you want, you can start designing your book.

Step 2 – Design Your Pages

OpenOffice Org offers a range of templates and styles that can help you design your book pages quickly and easily. The software also provides a wide selection of fonts, colours, and graphics to choose from, making it simple to create professional-looking pages. You can add images and graphics to your book layout, use headers and footers to create consistency throughout your book, and adjust the spacing between paragraphs and lines to improve readability.

Step 3 – Review and Edit

Once you've designed your book, it's crucial to review and edit the layout before publishing. You need to ensure that the fonts are consistent, the margins are correct, and the overall design is pleasing to the eye. You can use the OpenOffice Org spell-check feature to ensure that there are no errors in your text, and you can also ask someone else to review your book before publishing to catch any mistakes you may have missed.

In conclusion, mastering the art of book layout may seem like a daunting task, but with OpenOffice Org, it's simple and easy. By following these three simple steps, you can design a beautiful and professional layout for your book, without having to spend a lot of money on a professional designer. So, get started today and let your book shine!

In this final part of our series on laying out a book with OpenOffice.org, you will learn how to position illustrations in your book, how to use paragraph styles, and how to export in different formats. What you will take away from this is one method that has worked for me and many other people. At the end of this post, I will provide links for further study on the subject.
 
## Illustrations
 
To insert an image in OpenOffice Writer, simply click “Insert->Picture->From File“.  Then, select the image that you want, and click OK.
 
By default, the text will wrap around  your picture. If you do not want this or want a different type of wrapping, right click on the picture and choose the appropriate wrap method from the wrap menu.

The next thing to consider is anchoring. By default, your image will be anchored to the paragraph.  That means that if text is inserted or delete above or below your paragraph, that picture will stay with the paragraph as it moves, even to another page. If your image is page-specific, you should right click, move your arrow to “Anchor” and click “To Page”.  You can also do all of this from the Graphics toolbar, if you have it enabled.
 
One final point to note is that your printing company may have specific requirements for images. Many will require an image to be 300ppi (pixels per inch). It is beyond the scope of this article to teach you about photo management, but you can read more about this issue.
 
## Styles and Formatting
 

 
For most books, you will want the same font and font size throughout the entire book. You will also want the same indentation, margins, and other formatting. To begin, do the following:
 
1. Click on the Styles and Formatting button in the toolbar.
 
2. Right click on “First line indent” and click “New“. (That will create a style with indentation already set).
 
3. Give your style a name.
 
4. Click the Indents & Spacing tab. You can change the amount of indentation and line spacing (most books are single-spaced).
 
5. Click the Alignment tab. Most books have justified alignment.
 
6. Click the Text Flow tab.  Because your book will be justified, you will want hyphenation at the end to make the words flow nicely. Orphan and Widow control will keep single lines from ending up by themselves.
 
7. Click the “Font” tab and select the font, typeface, and size that you prefer. You can also select your language here.
 
8. Click the “Drop Caps” tab. If you want to display drop caps at the beginning of a paragraph, you can set that here.
 
Once you have your style the way you want it, click OK.  You will now have a style that you can apply to any text in your document.  By default, each paragraph will start with the previous style that you were using. You can even tweak that setting in the Organizer tab.
 
## Exporting
 
Most professional printers will not accept Open Document Text (.odt) format. While that might change in the future, for now you will have to rely on other formats.  While some printers allow you to export to Microsoft Word document format, you should avoid this if you can.  Chances are, your styles and formatting will be altered in the conversion. The safest bet is to export in PDF or PS format.
 
OpenOffice.org has built-in support for PDF exporting.  Just follow these easy steps:
 
1. Click “File”
 
2. Click “Export as PDF”
 
3. Keep it on “Lossless compression”. You should leave the other settings as they are unless you have been specifically told to change something.
 
4. Click “Export”.
 
5. Choose a file name and location and click OK.
 
If you need to export a PostScript (PS) file, use this method:
 
1. Click “File” and “Print”
 
2. Check the “Print to file” box.
 
3. Click “Print”
 
4. Choose the location and file name.
 
5. Click OK.
 
With the skills you have learned in this series, you now have a basic understanding of book layout using OpenOffice.org.  There are other typsetting features, such as frames, that you may want to consider.  There are also typesetting applications like Scribus for more layout-intensive projects (such as magazines).  Depending on what you want to accomplish, there are free software tools available for your needs.  In the end you will have quality work at an affordable cost.
