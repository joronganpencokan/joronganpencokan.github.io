# You've Been Missing Out! Discover The Simple Secret To Installing Unlimited Apps on your Apple TV Now!

Are you tired of the limited selection of apps available on your Apple TV? Have you been wanting to download your favorite apps but can’t seem to find them on the app store? Well, you’re in luck! We have discovered the simple secret to installing unlimited apps on your Apple TV today.

Firstly, let us clarify that Apple TV does not allow third-party apps to be installed directly onto the device. However, there is a solution to this dilemma – the sideloading method. Sideloading is the process of installing apps onto your device using a software program from a third-party source.

The software program we recommend is called Cydia Impactor, and it's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Follow these simple steps to sideload unlimited apps onto your Apple TV:

**Step 1:** Download Cydia Impactor and the app file(s) of your choice onto your computer.

**Step 2:** Connect your Apple TV to your computer with a USB cable.

**Step 3:** Launch Cydia Impactor and select your Apple TV from the list of devices.

**Step 4:** Drag and drop the app file(s) onto Cydia Impactor.

**Step 5:** Enter your Apple ID and password when prompted.

**Step 6:** Wait for Cydia Impactor to complete the installation process.

**Step 7:** On your Apple TV, go to **Settings** > **General** > **Profiles & Device Management**.

**Step 8:** Select the profile associated with the app you just installed and click "Trust."

**Step 9:** Launch the app on your Apple TV and enjoy!

It really is that simple! With this sideloading method, you can now install unlimited apps onto your Apple TV, including popular streaming services such as YouTube, Twitch, and Kodi. You can also access games and other apps not available on the app store.

However, we must caution that downloading apps from third-party sources can be risky. Always make sure to download from reputable sources and do not download any apps that seem suspicious. Additionally, Apple TV software updates may remove sideloaded apps or require reinstallation.

In conclusion, the sideloading method using Cydia Impactor is a simple and easy way to install unlimited apps onto your Apple TV. Now you can enjoy your favorite apps and games right on your TV screen. Happy sideloading!

- Open the App Store from the Apple TV home screen by selecting it with the remote.
 - Use the six navigation options at the top of the screen to locate an app you want to add to your Apple TV. The navigations options are:
 - Discover: Contains curated lists of apps and games, along with groups of the most popular ones by category
 - Apps: Shows popular video apps and lets you browse by categories
 - Games: Dedicated to standalone game apps you can download one at a time
 - Arcade: Showcases apps that are part of the Apple Arcade platform, which gives you access to a pre-selected library of games for a single monthly fee
 - Purchased: Lets you browse apps that you've bought or downloaded on other devices that are compatible with Apple TV
 - Search (the magnifying glass): Lets you find an app if you know the app's name already
 - Regardless of how you find the app you want to download, whether browsing or searching, the instructions for downloading and installing it are the same.
 - Select an app icon to see more information about it. If you decide you want to add it to your Apple TV, go to the button at the bottom left corner of the screen—it says Get or has a price on it—and click to download the app.

That step is annoying because using Apple TV's on-screen, one-letter-at-a-time keyboard is cumbersome and slow. While you can enter your password by voice or using the on-screen keyboard in the Remote app, you can skip that step entirely with this tip.

 - Starting with tvOS 13, Apple TV supports multiple users and Apple IDs.
 - Under Require Password, tap Purchases.
 - On the next screen, choose Never, and you won't have to enter your Apple ID for any purchase.
