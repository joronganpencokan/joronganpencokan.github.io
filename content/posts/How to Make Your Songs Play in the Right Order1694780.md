# Discover the Secret Hack to Keep Your Music in Perfect Sequence – Never Shuffle Again!

As music lovers, we all know the joy of a perfectly curated playlist. The right mix of songs can transport us to another world, set the tone for an evening, or simply put us in a better mood. However, there's nothing more annoying than when that playlist gets interrupted by a song that doesn't fit the mood or tempo. That's where the age-old practice of shuffling comes in. But what if we told you that there's a secret hack to keep your music in perfect sequence without ever shuffling again? 

Enter crossfading, the underrated feature that can take your playlist game to the next level. Crossfading is the seamless transition from one song to the next, where the end of one song blends into the beginning of the next song, creating a smooth, uninterrupted listening experience. Usually, this feature is used by DJs to transition between tracks, but it's become more accessible for music lovers over the years.

So, how does it work? A crossfade feature allows you to adjust the amount of overlap between two songs, creating a smooth, seamless transition. With the right settings, you can make your playlist feel like one continuous track without any jarring cuts or pauses.

To get started with crossfading, you'll need a music player that supports the feature. Most major music players such as iTunes, Spotify, and Winamp have crossfade options available. Once you have a player that supports it, you'll want to start experimenting with the crossfade settings to find the right balance for your playlist.

It's important to note that crossfading might not work for every genre of music. While it works well for electronic music, where the songs blend together naturally, it might not be appropriate for more vocally-driven music like ballads or acoustic songs.

Aside from creating a seamless listening experience, crossfading can also help to reduce the impact of abrupt endings and beginnings when listening to music on shuffle. For example, while shuffling your playlist, a slow ballad followed by a high-energy pop song can be jarring. With crossfading, you can have a smooth transition from one song to the next, maintaining the mood or tempo of your playlist.

In conclusion, if you're tired of shuffling disrupting your perfectly curated playlist, it's time to give crossfading a try. This underrated feature can give your playlist the much-needed flow and continuity it deserves, making your listening experience more enjoyable than ever before. Plus, it can help reduce the impact of jarring cuts when listening on shuffle. So what are you waiting for? Give crossfading a try and experience the magic of seamless transitions.

This article will teach you how to use mp3DirSorter to sort your music library alphabetically. Instructions apply to devices running Windows 10.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Download and open mp3DirSorter. Drag audio files from the storage device onto mp3DirSorter to sort alphabetically.Alternatively, rename files to be listed numerically, adding 01 at the beginning and repeating with 02, 03, and so on.

 
##   How to Reorder a List of Songs  
 

Follow these instructions to reorder your songs. This method uses a third-party program called mp3DirSorter.

 
- If you're using Windows, download and open mp3DirSorter. Since it's portable and doesn't need to be installed, you can use it from any location, including a flash drive. In fact, the program notifies you that it's intended for use on non-internal drives like SD cards and USB devices.
 - Make sure Windows can access the files on your storage device by inserting the device into your card reader or a spare USB port. Once found, the storage device will display in File/Windows Explorer with other local hard drives.
 - Drag the folder containing the audio files directly onto the mp3DirSorter program window to instantly have them sorted alphabetically. To sort the contents of entire drives, select and drag the drive letter to the program like you would drag a folder.
 - There are only two options for this program. Put a check next to one or both of these settings, depending on what you want to have done: Sort folders alphabetically and Sort files alphabetically.

 

To check that your albums and songs are in the correct order, play the device's contents again. You should now find that everything plays in alphabetical order.

##   A Second Solution  
 

If mp3DirSorter didn't reorder the songs correctly, you can go the manual route by renaming all the files numerically. For example, rename the first song you want to list with 01 at the beginning, and then repeat with each subsequent song, continuing with 02, 03, etc.

 
The manual technique won't be practical if you have a ton of music on your computer. If that's the case, you can use Windows 10 to batch-rename your song library.
