# Revolutionize Your Surface Pro 3 Setup with Hootoo's Game-Changing Ethernet and USB 3.0 Hub!

If you're a proud owner of a Microsoft Surface Pro 3, chances are you love its portability and versatility. However, as with any device, there are times when you need to expand its capabilities beyond its built-in components. Perhaps you need to connect to a wired network for faster and more stable internet access, or you need to plug in multiple USB devices to get your work done. This is where HooToo's HT-UE01 Ethernet and USB 3.0 hub comes in as a game-changer.

## The Features 

Hootoo's HT-UE01 is a compact but powerful hub that can turn your Surface Pro 3 into a productivity machine. Here are its key features:

### High-Speed Ethernet 

With a built-in Ethernet port, the HT-UE01 lets you connect to a wired network with speeds up to 1 Gbps. This means you can enjoy faster and more reliable internet access, especially in places where Wi-Fi signals are weak or congested. Whether you're streaming a movie or transferring large files, the Ethernet connection gives you the speed you need.

### USB 3.0 Connectivity 

In addition to Ethernet, the HT-UE01 has three USB 3.0 ports that can handle data transfer speeds up to 5 Gbps. This means you can connect multiple devices such as external hard drives, flash drives, printers, or even a second display. The USB 3.0 ports are backward compatible with USB 2.0 and 1.1, so you can use older devices as well.

### Plug-and-Play Convenience 

The HT-UE01 is designed to be easy to use. Simply plug it into your Surface Pro 3's USB port, and you're ready to go. There's no need to install drivers or software, and the hub is powered by your Surface Pro 3's USB port, so there are no extra cords or adapters to worry about. The hub also has a compact and portable design, so you can take it with you wherever you go.

## The Benefits 

With the HooToo HT-UE01 Ethernet and USB 3.0 hub, you can transform your Surface Pro 3 into a more powerful and productive machine. Here are some of the benefits:

### Faster and More Reliable Internet 

By connecting to a wired network, you can enjoy faster and more stable internet access, especially in places where Wi-Fi signals are weak or congested. This means you can stream movies, video chat, or work on cloud-based applications without interruptions or buffering.

### More Productivity 

With three USB 3.0 ports, you can connect multiple devices such as external hard drives, flash drives, printers, or even a second display. This means you can get more work done in less time, whether you're editing photos, writing documents, or creating presentations. You can also free up your Surface Pro 3's USB port for other uses.

### More Flexibility 

The HT-UE01's plug-and-play design means you can easily switch between using it and not using it. If you only need Ethernet or USB 3.0 occasionally, you can simply unplug the hub and your Surface Pro 3 will return to its original configuration. This means you don't have to compromise on portability or convenience.

## Conclusion 

The HooToo HT-UE01 Ethernet and USB 3.0 hub is a game-changer for Surface Pro 3 owners who need to expand their device's capabilities.

Surface Pro 3 is an amazing do it all device, but there is a limitation, you only have one USB port to connect external devices and there is not Ethernet port, which is essential for many users, especially for IT professionals.
 
As such I’ve been in the quest to a solution to this problem, that’s when I found the HooToo HT-UE01, which is a 3-port USB 3.0 hub with a 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet Converter.
 

 
The HooToo HT-UE01 works flawlessly. Simply connect the hub to the Surface Pro 3 (Surface Pro 2 or Surface Pro) and install the corresponding drivers (the box comes with a mini CD with the software, but, of course, you don’t get a CD-reader with your Surface), and start plugging accessories and/or connect the Ethernet cable to the RJ-45 slot located on the side.
 
Overall, the hub works great with any peripheral I tried. It’s also very affordable, despite to what you might think the HooToo HT-UE01 is considerably cheap at less than $30. The solution is compatible with IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.3u, IEEE 802.3ab, IEEE 802.3az (Energy Efficient Ethernet), supports Wake-On-LAN (WOL), and the USB 3.0 are bus powered.
 
The hub also looks great, and the black and gray color matches the Surface Pro 3 color scheme. Although it is very lightweight at only 2.2 ounces, which can make it feel like a bit in cheap-plasticky, it shouldn’t be an issue for the price and the capabilities you get.
