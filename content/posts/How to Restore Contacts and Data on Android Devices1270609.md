Are you the type who has a habit of clearing out their contact list or accidentally deletes important information on their Android device? Losing essential data can be a frustrating and devastating experience. But, fear not, for there is a way to recover it all. In this article, we'll be discussing the secret to retrieving lost contacts and data on your Android device with guaranteed success.

## Understanding the Problem

Before delving into the solution, let's take a few minutes to understand why losing data on your Android device is such an enormous issue. Losing your contacts alone can cause a lot of frustration and discomfort, especially if you have no way of retrieving the lost data. You may have to start creating  a new list from scratch, adding up names, phone numbers, and email addresses, which is generally not something you want to do in your free time. Losing essential data like photos, documents, and videos can also lead to significant loss and inconveniences.

## The Secret Solution

Luckily, there is an easy and straightforward solution to retrieving lost data on your Android device. Have you ever heard of backup and restore? With backup and restore, you can recover lost data in just a few clicks, and we guarantee that this solution works with all Android devices.

### Step 1 – Backup your device periodically

The first step in safeguarding your data is to back it up using Google's Backup and Restore feature. This feature allows Android devices to automatically backup your data to your Google account. You can customize the automatic backup setting to suit your preferences, whether it's daily, weekly, or monthly backups.

### Step 2 – Retrieve the data

If unfortunately, you've already lost essential data on your Android device, don't despair. You can retrieve it from the backup you have created in step one. Here is how:

- Go to Settings > System > Backup > Backup Now. 

- Once the backup is completed, you can reset your device to factory default, deleting all data.

- After your device resets, you’ll be prompted to sign in to the Google account that you used during the backup process.

- Select Restore, and all the backed-up data will be retrieved back to your device.

### Step 3 – Use a Data recovery tool

If backing up your data didn't work for you or if you hadn't set up your backup before you lost your data, you can still use third-party data recovery tools to retrieve your lost contacts and data. There are several applications that you can purchase or download for free that help you scan and recover lost data. These tools are user-friendly and straightforward to use, and they boast a high success rate of retrieving lost data.

## Conclusion

There is a way to retrieve your lost data without any hassle, and we guarantee that it will work.

If you accidentally delete a contact from your entire contact list, in seconds, the loss of data is “updated” onto your Google account. This could be a huge problem and also, this is true for apps and other synchronized accounts. Even if your phone is lost and you wipe it using a security program, such as Carbonite mobile or Lookout, the wiping of data on your device goes to Google’s servers and it’s deleted.

 
### How to restore lost Android data



Because of the system that Google has in place for its devices, many are going to third party apps to backup their information. Apps like Titanium backup are perfect for backing up apps and app information, but the downside is that the backup itself takes up a lot of space, and new information is not added immediately, so it might be forgotten.
 
Also, because the backup is on the device itself, in the case of a total wipe, all the information is permanently deleted.

But Google has thought of this also, and with a bit of ingenuity, you can restore your contacts just as they were before anything happened to them. This is possible because Google keeps multiple records of your information in more states, and if something has happened, you can revert to an earlier state. Although complete restore of data is not guaranteed, this method should provide you with some of the information that was deleted.

 
#### Google has got you covered


For restoring Google contacts, all you have to do is go to your Gmail account, enter your Contacts and under “More”, you will find an option that allows you to restore your contacts to a previous state. By clicking on “Restore Contacts” a window will open asking you from when do you want your contacts to be restored and you can go as back as 30 days. Once you have selected your restoration point, you can click “Restore” and your contacts from that time will load on your Gmail account, from where they will be synced to your Android device in a few seconds.

For restoring settings and other information, you will need to have activated the backup features from your Android device. Go to “Settings” -> “Backup and Restore” and check “Back up my data” and “Automatic Restore”. This will ensure that if you delete an app or multiple apps, their information is deleted, but a copy of it is baked up to your Google account.
When you reinstall the deleted apps, the information stored on Google’s server will be downloaded and added to the apps, this will occur if you check “Automatic Restore”, but again, the integrity of the data is not guaranteed, and some information might be lost in the process, but it’s still better than nothing.
Although not perfect, these methods will allows you to back up data on your Android device. Because Google makes regular copies of your data, you can rest assured that you will not lose anything. This system will definitely get better with time, and if the quality of Google’s present services has tought us anything, it’s that they want to perfect their services and make them the best.
