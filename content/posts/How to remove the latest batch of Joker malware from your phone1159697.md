# Introduction

The Joker malware has been taking over phones everywhere, and it is important to learn how to eradicate it as soon as possible. This malicious application has been found in many Android apps and can steal your personal information and money. In this article, we will discuss what Joker malware is, how it works, and how to prevent it from infecting your device.

# What is Joker Malware?

Joker malware is a type of virus that is designed to steal users' information and money. It gets its name from the infamous comic book villain because it is just as dangerous and tricky. The Joker malware is embedded in Android apps found on Google Play, making it easy for users to download it without realizing it.

When an Android user downloads an infected app, the Joker malware is activated. It then subscribes the user to premium services without their knowledge and steals their personal information, including their email, phone number, and location. This data is then used for identity theft, phishing scams, and other criminal activities.

# How Does Joker Malware Work?

Joker malware often disguises itself as a legitimate Android application. It then tricks users by requesting access to their device’s SMS, camera, and other sensitive areas. Once the user grants access, the Joker malware can now send SMS messages and capture images without the user's knowledge.

Moreover, it can also intercept and steal users' payment information when they enter their payment details into financial transaction apps. It does this by simulating a user's behavior and automated payments in the background.

# How to Eradicate Joker Malware from Your Device

The following are steps you can take to remove Joker malware from your device:

### 1. Uninstall Infected Apps

If you notice any unusual behavior on your phone, check to see if you have installed any new Android applications recently. If yes and if you suspect it might be infected, you'll need to remove it from your phone. Here's how to do it:

* Go to the Settings app on your phone.
* Click on “Apps and Notifications” or “Applications.”
* Click on the infected app.
* Select “Uninstall.”

### 2. Update Your Android OS

Ensure your Android device is updated to the latest version. This will protect your phone from any vulnerabilities that may be exploited by the Joker malware. To update your phone:

* Go to Settings
* Scroll down and tap “About Phone”
* Click “System Updates.”
* Confirm your phone's OS is up-to-date.

### 3. Install anti-virus software

Android devices are prone to viruses and malware. To ensure that you're always protected, you need to install an antivirus app. These apps come with real-time scanning, which means they can detect malware as soon as it infects your phone. Some popular options include McAfee, Norton, and Kaspersky.

### 4. Be Vigilant When Downloading Apps

Ensure that you always download apps from reputable app stores like Google Play, Apple Store, or Amazon. Also, before downloading any app, check reviews to see what other users are saying about it. If there are numerous negative reviews, it is probably best to avoid it.

# Conclusion

Joker malware is an Android virus that has taken over phones everywhere. It's important to take proactive steps to protect your device, such as staying vigilant when downloading apps and always updating your Android operating system. By following these steps, you'll be able to eradicate Joker malware from your device and protect your personal and financial information. Don't wait until it's too late – start taking action today!

If this story sounds familiar, it’s only because it keeps happening again and again. Google almost always does its due diligence and deletes offending programs once they’re discovered, but developers behind these apps are uploading them faster than it can handle. Tap or click here to see what nastiness was found in a previous batch.
And now, another group of malicious apps has been discovered that infects victims’ phones with fleeceware. If you have one of these apps on your device, it will sign you up for paid subscriptions behind your back and use your phone to fund its ad fraud endeavors. Thankfully, we have the full names and images of all the apps you need to remove right now.

 
## Return of the Joker


According to a new security alert from Pradeo, the infamous Joker malware has somehow made its way on to the Google Play Store again in the form of six newly discovered fleeceware apps. These programs appear like ordinary apps at first, but once they’re installed, they quickly go to work signing victims up for subscription services without their permission.
Joker is no stranger to the Google Play Store, and unlike many of its contemporaries, it’s relatively hard to detect. This is because the malware uses as little code as possible and hides within the depths of your device — sometimes even deleting its own app icon in the process.

Together, the malicious apps managed to rack up more than 200,000 installs before Google removed them from circulation. But anyone still with these apps on their device needs to take a moment to delete them before anything else can go awry. 
As anyone who has experienced a fleeceware infection can tell you, ignoring the problem can become quite expensive. 
Tap or click here to see how one fleeceware app netted more than $100 million in ill-gotten gains.

 
## What apps do I need to remove from my device?


Pradeo has thankfully preserved images and names for all six of the malicious fleeceware apps in its update. If you have any of the following apps on your device, delete them immediately:
Safety AppLock
Convenient Scanner 2
Push Message-Texting&SMS
Emoji Wallpaper

Separate Doc Scanner
Fingertip GameBox
As with previous instances, most of these apps appear to masquerade as ordinary tools before springing the trap on victims.
To uninstall the apps, open Settings on your device and find the menu option labeled Apps. Scroll through your apps and locate the entries from the list above. Then, tap on them to uninstall and delete them.
If you’re still having issues after deleting the apps, a factory reset is in order. Tap or click here to see how to complete a full factory reset on your Android phone.
