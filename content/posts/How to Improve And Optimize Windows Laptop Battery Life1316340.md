# Unleash the Power of Your Laptop Battery with These Game-Changing Tips!

In today's fast-paced world, laptops have become an essential part of our lives. Whether you are a student, working professional, or a gamer, you would understand how crucial it is to have a laptop with a longer battery life. However, with numerous apps running in the background and constant usage, your laptop's battery life may drain out quickly. Moreover, a dead laptop battery in the middle of an important task can be frustrating. The good news is, you can now unleash the power of your laptop battery with these game-changing tips!

## Dim the Screen Brightness

One of the easiest ways to save your laptop's battery life is by reducing the screen brightness. Your laptop's screen consumes a massive amount of power, and by dimming the screen, you can save a considerable amount of battery life.

## Turn Off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

Wi-Fi and Bluetooth tend to consume a lot of battery power, even when you are not using them. Therefore, turning off the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection can save a lot of battery power. If you are working offline, then there is no need to keep these apps running in the background.

## Close Unnecessary Apps

Many apps running in the background can lead to excessive battery drainage. By closing these unnecessary apps, you can save power and keep your laptop running for a longer time. Therefore, always make sure to close the apps that you are not using.

## Adjust Display Settings

Most laptops come with pre-installed display settings that consume a lot of battery power. For example, many laptops come with 3D display settings, which can be turned off to save battery life. You can also change the display settings to "Power Saver Mode," which can significantly improve your battery life.

## Use Efficient Power Management Tools

Most modern laptops come with efficient power management tools that can help you save battery power. By using these tools, you can adjust the power settings of your laptop and maximize its battery life. You can also install third-party software to enhance the battery life of your laptop.

## Remove External Devices

If you have any external devices plugged into your laptop, such as an external hard drive or mouse, then it's time to remove them. These external devices tend to consume a lot of power, and by removing them, you can save a considerable amount of battery life.

## Use Hibernate Mode

Many laptops come with a hibernate mode that can help you save battery life. This mode saves the current state of your laptop and shuts it down, saving battery life. When you restart your laptop, it will return to the same state as before.

## Keep Your Laptop Clean

Keeping your laptop clean can significantly improve its overall performance, including battery life. A lot of dust and debris can block your laptop's vents, which can lead to overheating and excessive battery drainage.

In conclusion, your laptop's battery life may depend on various factors. However, by following these game-changing tips, you can significantly improve your laptop's battery life and enjoy a longer-lasting laptop experience. Remember to adjust the display settings, remove external devices, close unnecessary apps, reduce screen brightness, and use efficient power management tools. By implementing these tips, you can unleash the power of your laptop battery and get more work done, without worrying about battery drainage.

While laptop is good for mobile use, its miserable battery life is always its Achilles’ heel. If you are a power user, the standard laptop battery can usually last about 2 to 3 hours whereas a standard user can see his/her battery run for about 4 -5 hours. Today, we will show you how to improve and optimize your Windows laptop battery life.

First of all, Windows built-in app does not provide us with advanced statistics and options about the laptop battery. We will need to use a third party app to monitor and see the stats of the battery. I am using BatteryBar free on my Windows 7 and Windows 8 computers. The basic version of BatteryBar will let you see advanced statistics about your laptop battery in real time like the total capacity of the battery in mWh, charge rate if the laptop is being charged, full run time and battery wear.
 

 
The main reason why I use BatteryBar is that it will install a statusbar icon which will show you the total time left in full discharge. You can click on the BatteryBar icon to change the values in hours and minutes or percentages.
 
## Improving Laptop Battery Life
 
Normally, the laptop LCD screen consumes the most battery power. Windows gives us an option to adjust the brightness of the screen. Reducing the screen brightness to even one point will usually improve the battery time by 10%.
 
To adjust the screen brightness in Windows 8, just go to Charms bar search ( WinKey + Q) and search for “adjust screen brightness”. Under Settings, you will be able to get “Adjust Screen Brightness” result. Click on it to open the configuration app.
 
You can adjust the screen brightness by moving the slider left or right.
 
You may also want to pause or stop some applications and services that are not needed when the laptop is not plugged in. Choosing which services to disable and which applications to close is the tricky part. If you are doing it manually, you will have to go through each and every service in order to be sure that you are disabling only unnecessary services.
 
Windows offers another way to configure this by using different power plans. You can go to Windows Power Options to select from three pre-configured power options:
 
- Balanced
 - Power saver
 - High performance

 
There are third party software which will be able to do all the settings discussed above automatically. We only have to configure the settings in the software and everything else will be automatic. The software discussed above, BatteryBar, also does this but these settings are included in the paid version. We will be using another free software for this purpose.
 
BatteryCare is another free software which will show advanced statistics about the laptop battery like the total capacity, current capacity, charge/discharge rate, voltage, wear level of the laptop battery etc. The real strength of BatteryCare lies in its settings.
 
In the settings, we will be able to adjust different optimizations like disabling the sidebar gadgets and aero theme, pausing Windows services on battery mode. You can check each item which you want to disable. This will save some power.
 
Another great feature of BatteryCare is that it can automatically switch to a different power option when the laptop goes without power. For example, normally my laptop is set to high performance when power is plugged in but when it’s on battery, it will automatically shift to power saver mode.
 
Another feature of BatteryCare is the calculation of calibration time. It will automatically notify you when your laptop battery has reached 30 discharge cycles. After that you can calibrate your battery which will improve the overall life of the battery.
 
Hopefully these tips and utilities will keep your informed about the condition of your battery. You will be able to replace it in time without any problems.
