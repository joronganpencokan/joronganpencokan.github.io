# Revolutionize Your Data Tracking: Learn How To Manage Multiple Google Analytics Accounts Like a Pro!

If you're a digital marketer or website owner, you're probably familiar with Google Analytics - the popular web analytics service offered by Google. Google Analytics is a powerful tool that can help you gain valuable insights into your website's performance and user behavior. However, what do you do when you have multiple websites to track or multiple subdomains to track on one website? Managing multiple Google Analytics accounts can be overwhelming, but we're here to help you make the transition smoother.

In this article, we'll go through some tips and tricks to help you manage multiple Google Analytics accounts like a pro!

## Understand Google Analytics Accounts Structure

Before we dive into the management aspect of Google Analytics accounts, it's important to understand the structure of accounts. Here are the three types of Google Analytics accounts:

### 1. Individual Account

An individual account is used by one person to manage one or multiple Google Analytics properties.

### 2. Company Account

A company account is used by a company to manage one or multiple Google Analytics accounts.

### 3. Google 10 Account

Google 10 accounts are larger accounts with access to 10 or more properties.

## Linking Multiple Google Analytics Accounts

If you have multiple properties or subdomains on one website, you can link them to one Google Analytics account. Here's how:

### 1. Create a new property

The first step is to create a new property in your Google Analytics account.

### 2. Get the tracking code for the new property

After creating a new property, you'll be given a tracking code unique to that property.

### 3. Add tracking code to your website

Copy and paste your new tracking code to your website's source code.

### 4. Verify your tracking code

After adding your tracking code, you need to verify that it's working by going to the Admin section in your Google Analytics account and checking the real-time data.

### 5. Create a new view for the second website

In your new property, you can create a new view for the second website by going to the Admin section and selecting "Create View."

### 6. Link the two views

In the Admin section, select "View Settings" for the second website's view and click "Copy View."

### 7. Finish and verify

Once you have completed all the steps, you can verify the success of the link by checking the real-time data for the second view.

## Use The Google Analytics API

The Google Analytics API (application programming interface) allows you to access the data in your Google Analytics account and use it with other applications or tools. With the API, you can automatically pull data and create custom reports to blend data from multiple Google Analytics accounts.

## Assign User Permissions

If you have a team of marketers or analysts, it's best to assign user permissions for each Google Analytics account to help manage and secure data. In the Admin panel, you can manage user permissions and grant access to the accounts and properties that team members need.

## Group Google Analytics Accounts

If you have multiple Google Analytics accounts, you can group them together for easy management. In the Admin panel, select "Account Settings," and then click "Edit" under "Account Grouping." You can then create new groups for your accounts by selecting "Create Account Group" and choosing which accounts you want to group together.

## Conclusion

Managing multiple Google Analytics accounts can seem difficult, but with the tips and tricks above, it can be a breeze. Whether you're linking accounts to one property, using the API to create custom reporting solutions or assigning users to manage accounts, these tricks will help you streamline your processes and make informed decisions based on your data.
