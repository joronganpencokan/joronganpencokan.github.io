Introduction

Mac has come a long way in the technology space, and there's no denying that owning one is a privilege. With Mac, you have access to cutting-edge hardware, software, and exciting features that have made your digital life much more manageable. One of such features is Multimedia Control. It helps you to control your Mac's audio and video playback with ease. However, what if we take it a step further and tell you can control multimedia with just your hands? It's possible - and this article will show you how.

How to Use Hand Gestures for Multimedia Control

Step 1: Enable Hand Gestures

For macOS Sierra or later, open System Preferences, click on "Accessibility," and select "Mouse & Trackpad." From there, click on "Trackpad Options," and then select "Enable dragging with three fingers" and "Tap to click." This allows you to control multimedia with hand gestures.

Step 2: Basic Gestures for Media Control

To pause/play a video or audio, tap with two fingers on the trackpad.

To fast forward, swipe right with three fingers.

To rewind, swipe left with three fingers.

To turn down volume, swipe down with two fingers on the trackpad.

To turn up the volume, swipe up with two fingers on the trackpad.

Step 3: Advanced Gestures for Media Control

Apart from the basic hand gestures mentioned earlier, some advanced gestures also help control multimedia with your hands. These gestures require more fingers on the trackpad and are:

For full-screen mode, swipe up with four fingers.

To exit full-screen mode, swipe down with four fingers.

Step 4: Make Use of Siri

You can use Siri to control your multimedia as well by enabling Siri, and then you can tell Siri to do what you want. For example, "Hey Siri, Play music."

Conclusion

By now, you can see that controlling multimedia on your Mac with just your hands is an excellent way to get the most out of your experience. You don't need a remote, a keyboard, or a mouse. You only need to enable hand gestures, and you're good to go. Using this method, you can quickly pause videos when someone interrupts, lower the volume when the telemarketer calls, and much more. So, go ahead, unlock the ultimate Mac experience by mastering multimedia control with just your hands.

Technology has grown really fast in the past few decades and we have all seen a lot of new technology coming to the market in the past few years. From pressing keys to typing words to speaking and having your machine recognize your voice, everything is now possible.
 
One new technology is gestures. A gesture is what allows you to use your body-parts to control your machine. For instance, you can just wave your hand at your machine and it will respond. Most of the time, the gestures are used while playing multimedia content. If you are a Mac user you have a cool app called ControlAir that lets you control the multimedia content on your Mac using gestures.
 
ControlAir is a free app at the Mac App Store that lets you control your machine using your hand gestures. Here’s a quick video that shows how the app works:
 
## Here’s how you can get started using ControlAir:
 
Get the app installed from the App Store to your Mac. Again, it’s a free app, so there’s no damage to your wallet.
 
Once the app is installed, launch it from your Launchpad.
 
When the app is first launched it should take you to the setup panel where you can configure the app to work with your Mac. Click on “Next” and you will move forward.
 

 
On the next screen you need to align your head so that it shows up in the red circle. It helps the app to recognize your gestures. When you are done click on “Next” and you will be taken to the next panel.
 
The next couple of screens show you some information about the app. So just hit “Next” on all of them and you should be done.
 
After configuring the app, you can use it with the following media apps on your Mac. It just about supports all the popular media apps out there.
 
- iTunes
 - QuickTime Player
 - Rdio
 - Spotify
 - VLC
 - VOX
 - Gear for Google Play and YouTube

 
Just launch any of the above apps on your Mac and start playing a music track. It will check if ControlAir is working correctly.
 
When the music starts playing, raise your index finger to the webcam on your Mac and you should see a menu that looks like the below image.
 
Just move your finger around and the selection will change. When you are at the option you wish to select, lower your finger, and the highlighted option will be selected. The options that you can choose from are Volume DOWN, Previous Track, Play/Pause, Next Track, and Volume UP.
 
It works even when the media app is running in the background, so you don’t have to keep it open all the time you wish to use your hand gestures to control the content.
 
If you ever want to disable the ControlAir app from recognizing your gestures, you can click on its icon in the top menu, select “Disable ControlAir” and it will be disabled.
 
## Conclusion
 
If you are one of those users who always wants to have the latest technology in their hands, the above app should definitely feed your hunger for the tech.
