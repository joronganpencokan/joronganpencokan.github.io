Google is one of the most popular search engines globally, and it offers a lot of powerful features, including personalized news streams.

Have you ever thought about turning your public Google+ posts into an RSS feed? Having an RSS feed for your Google+ stream is not common, but it can be done with a Web service called Googomi. This is great if you’re looking to crosspost from Google+ to another social network, or even if you want to allow others to subscribe to your Google+ posts by email or in their favorite feed reader.
 
Here’s how to get your very own RSS feed for your Google+ stream.
 
## Getting Your RSS Feed
 
1. First, go to the Googomi website and click on the green “your profile” button in the middle of the home page.
 

 
2. Select the Google email address associated with the Google+ profile that you want an RSS feed for and click on “allow.”
 
3. Next, select the Google account that you want to use, and on the next page click on “allow access.”
 
4. Finally, you’ll be directed back to Googomi, where you’ll see your custom RSS feed and your ten most recent posts.
 
## Using Your RSS Feed
 
How you choose to use this RSS feed is up to you, but I’d suggest using it in an IFTTT recipe. The possibilities of what IFTTT can do with RSS feeds are practically endless. One thing to do with it is send your Google+ posts to another site or app. You can send your Google+ posts to:
 
- RSS -> Twitter – Twitter
 - RSS -> Evernote – Evernote
 - RSS -> Facebook page – your Facebook page
 - RSS -> Tumblr – Tumblr
 - RSS -> LinkedIn – LinkedIn

 
## Final Thoughts
 
As you can see, Googomi is the perfect tool for exporting your public Google+ posts to RSS. It’s easy to use and only takes a few minutes. You can then use that RSS feed for a number of things, like crossposting to various social networks. This is a great way to bring more traffic to your Google+ profile, and also great for sharing those gems that you only post to Google+.
