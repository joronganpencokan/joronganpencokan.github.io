Well, we have good news for you! With a few simple steps, you can mirror your iPhone to your TV without spending a dime on Apple TV.

There are several ways to mirror your iPhone to your TV, but we'll focus on two of the most effective methods that require no additional hardware or cords.

## Method 1: Use AirPlay with an Apple device

This method uses Apple's proprietary technology, AirPlay, to mirror your iPhone to your TV. Note that both your iPhone and TV must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network for this to work.

2. Swipe down from the upper right corner of your iPhone to access the Control Center.

3. Tap the "Screen Mirroring" icon.

4. Select your TV from the list of available devices.

5. Enter the AirPlay code that appears on your TV screen (if prompted).

6. Voila! Your iPhone's screen is now mirrored on your TV.

You can use this method to watch videos, play games, and more on your TV, all while controlling everything from your iPhone.

## Method 2: Use Chromecast with a non-Apple device

If you don't have an Apple TV or an iPhone, don't worry! You can still mirror your phone to your TV with a Google Chromecast. Keep in mind that you'll need a non-Apple device, such as an Android phone or a laptop, for this method.

1. Connect your Chromecast to your TV and set it up.

2. Download the Google Home app on your non-Apple device.

3. Open the app and select your Chromecast device.

4. Tap the "Cast my screen" option.

5. Select your TV from the list of available devices.

6. Your phone's screen is now mirrored on your TV.

With Chromecast, you can not only mirror your phone's screen, but also stream videos from apps like Netflix, YouTube, and Hulu using your phone as a remote.

In conclusion, mirroring your iPhone to your TV can be done easily and without having to spend any money on Apple TV. Whether you use AirPlay or Chromecast, you'll be able to enjoy your favorite content on a larger screen, and share the experience with those around you.
