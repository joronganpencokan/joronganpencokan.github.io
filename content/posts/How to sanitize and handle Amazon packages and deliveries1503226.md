Shocking truth about hidden germs on your Amazon deliveries - Expert tips to sanitize and stay safe!

The global pandemic has made online shopping an essential part of our lives. Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, has become our go-to destination for everything from groceries to electronics. With contact-free delivery, Amazon has made it easier for us to shop safely from our homes. However, have you ever thought about the germs that may be lurking on your Amazon packages? Here we reveal the shocking truth about hidden germs on your Amazon deliveries and expert tips to sanitize and stay safe.

The Reality of Germs on Your Amazon Deliveries

A recent study conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that the COVID-19 virus can survive on cardboard surfaces for up to 24 hours. This means that your Amazon package could contain the virus if it has been handled by someone who has the virus. Apart from the COVID-19 virus, there are several other germs and bacteria that can survive on surfaces, including Salmonella, E. Coli, and Staphylococcus. These germs can cause health problems ranging from gastrointestinal issues to skin infections.

Fortunately, there are several ways to sanitize your Amazon packages and protect yourself from germs.

Expert Tips to Sanitize and Stay Safe

1. Wear Gloves and a Mask

Before touching your Amazon package, wear gloves and a mask. This will protect you from any germs that may be present on the package.

2. Sanitize Your Package

After receiving your package, spray it with a disinfectant spray or wipe it with a disinfectant wipe. You can use products like Lysol, Clorox, or rubbing alcohol to clean the surface.

3. Let It Sit

After sanitizing your package, let it sit for a few hours before opening it. This will allow any remaining germs to die off.

4. Wash Your Hands

After opening your package and discarding the packaging, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. This will ensure that any germs that may have come in contact with your hands are removed.

5. Avoid Touching Your Face

Even if you have sanitized your package and washed your hands, avoid touching your face, eyes, nose, or mouth. This will help prevent the spread of any germs that may be present.

In conclusion, online shopping has become an essential part of our lives, and Amazon is the leading player in this space. However, with the ongoing pandemic, it is crucial to be aware of the germs that may be present on your Amazon deliveries. By following the expert tips mentioned above, you can sanitize your packages and stay safe. Remember, prevention is better than cure, and a few extra steps can go a long way in protecting yourself and your loved ones from germs.

Remember, it’s not robots or drones that are handling our packages, but real people — people who can get sick just like the rest of us. We can’t say for sure how long the virus lasts on surfaces, but there are indications it’s longer than we originally thought.

What does that mean for home deliveries? We must be diligent. To properly clean your packages, you need to know the right steps to kill germs and keep infectious particles out. So, what are the best ways to handle and disinfect your deliveries so they’re safe to bring indoors?

 
## Social distancing: It even works with deliveries


Once your delivery arrives, let it sit for at least three hours before retrieving it. This will reduce your chance of contacting any airborne particles from the delivery person. 

 
## Handle with care


Social distancing will only protect you from human-to-human transmission. For germs lingering on your packages, you need to take extra precautions.
When you retrieve your deliveries, take note of the packaging. If you have them, put on a pair of gloves and place your package in a safe, secure outdoor location — like the backyard, patio or balcony — for 24 hours.
If it’s a plastic package, bag or envelope, leave it in your secure spot for up to three days. Trace amounts of particles could still cling to the material, but they will be less likely to infect you or spread indoors.
Once you’ve moved your packages, remove the gloves and dispose of them immediately. Carefully wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water.

 
## Keeping it clean


When you’re ready to retrieve your packages, put on a new pair of gloves. Use disinfecting wipes to clean off the outside of each parcel and make sure the chemicals they contain will kill the virus and other germs. 
You can use a disinfectant wipe or a paper towel moistened with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Tap or click here to see what products the FDA recommends.
Next, open the packages and discard the boxes. Wipe down the items inside with disinfectant and remove your gloves before bringing the items inside. Dispose of any wipes and gloves immediately, then wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water. Do we need to tell you again? Wash for at least 20 seconds.
If you want extra peace of mind, you can leave the opened items in your safe location for another one to three days before bringing them indoors. Otherwise, place them in an area that’s free of heavy foot-traffic and away from family members and food, if possible.
Wash your hands after every time you use or handle the items for at least two weeks. Anyone else using them should do the same, and everyone should avoid touching their faces or eyes.
Not all items can afford to sit outside for extended periods of time. If your deliveries are perishable, sanitize the packaging using the steps above, then put them directly in your refrigerator and avoid tables and countertops. 
Use gloves to handle the containers and avoid hugging them close to your body when moving them. Any outer packaging should be removed and thrown directly into the trash before storing the items in your fridge. 
Try to isolate them from other items in your refrigerator, wait one to three days, then wipe them down again before opening.

 
## Clean hands, clean bill of health


One thing you’ll keep seeing on my site and in the news is how important it is to wash your hands. This is because the coronavirus’ outer surface is made of a fat-like material that melts with soap and warm water. Keeping your hands clean is one of the most effective ways to slow the spread of the virus.
The CDC recommends you wash your hands not just when you interact with packages or venture outdoors. You should also wash your hands for each of the following situations:

 
Before, during and after preparing foodBefore eating foodBefore and after caring for someone at home who is sick with vomiting or diarrheaBefore and after treating a cut or woundAfter using the toiletAfter changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toiletAfter blowing your nose, coughing or sneezingAfter touching an animal, animal feed or animal wasteAfter handling pet food or pet treatsAfter touching garbage


All these extra steps may seem excessive, but COVID-19 is no laughing matter. As our understanding of the disease grows, we’re finding that it’s extremely dangerous, not just for the elderly or immunocompromised, but for people of all ages. 
If we practice good hygiene, we can safely rely on deliveries to stock up on supplies without getting infected. Stay vigilant and stay healthy.
