# Unlock the Secret Privacy Setting on Spotify and Keep Your Playlist Safe from Prying Eyes!

As music lovers, we all have unique tastes in music, and we often create playlists that define who we are. However, we may not always want to share our music preferences with others. Spotify is undoubtedly one of the best music streaming services, but did you know that there's a "secret" privacy setting that can help you keep your playlists safe from prying eyes? In this article, we'll guide you through how to enable this setting and keep your music preferences private.

## Step 1: Hide Your Recently Played Artists

By default, Spotify displays the five most recently played artists on your profile. This feature allows your friends to discover new music or see what you're currently listening to. However, if you don't want anyone to know what you've been playing, hide your recently played artists by following these simple steps.

1. Open the Spotify app on your mobile device or desktop.
2. Click on your profile picture located at the top-right corner of the screen.
3. Scroll down and click on the "Edit Profile" button.
4. Toggle off the "Display Recently Played Artists" option.
5. Click on the "Save Profile" button.

Once you've turned off this option, nobody can see the most recent artists you've played, including yourself. This means that you'll need to navigate to the "History" section to see your previously played tracks instead.

## Step 2: Make Your Playlists Private

If you've created a playlist that you don't want others to see, you can make it private. Unlike public playlists, private playlists won't appear on your profile, and nobody can see them unless you share the playlist's link directly. Here's how you can make your playlist private.

1. Open the Spotify app.
2. Navigate to the playlist you want to make private.
3. Click on the three dots located to the right of the playlist title.
4. Select "Make Private" from the drop-down menu.
5. Confirm your decision by clicking on the "Make Private" button.

Once you've made your playlist private, it will no longer be visible to anyone except you. If you ever change your mind and want to make a playlist public again, follow the same steps and select the "Make Public" option instead. Additionally, you can always check your playlists' privacy settings by clicking on the "Edit" button next to the playlist title.

## Step 3: Hide Your Activity Feed

Spotify's activity feed is a feature that shows your followers what you're listening to in real-time. While this feature can be excellent for discovering new music, it can also expose your music preferences to others. If you want to hide your activity feed, here's what you need to do.

1. Open the Spotify app.
2. Click on the gear icon located at the top-right corner of the screen.
3. Navigate to "Display Options" and toggle off the "Show Recently Played" option.
4. Scroll down to "Social" and toggle off the "Activity Sharing" option.
5. Click on the "Save" button.

By disabling these two features, your followers won't be able to see what you're listening to or share your activity with others. Keep in mind that disabling activity sharing will also hide your friend's activity feed.

## Conclusion

Spotify is an incredible music streaming service that offers a vast library of songs, podcasts, and playlists. However, sometimes we want to keep our music preferences private. By following these simple steps, you can unlock the secret privacy setting on Spotify and keep your playlists safe from prying eyes. Whether you want to hide your activity feed, recent artists, or private playlists, these settings will allow you to enjoy your music without worrying about who's watching. So go ahead and enjoy your music without any worries!
