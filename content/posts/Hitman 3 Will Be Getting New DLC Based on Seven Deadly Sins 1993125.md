The mission will be set in a war-torn city, and players will have to navigate through the chaos and destruction to eliminate their target.

The second mission, Gluttony, takes place on a luxurious cruise ship, where Agent 47 has been hired to take out a corrupt politician who has been embezzling funds. The mission will involve infiltrating the ship's kitchen and using poisoned food to take out the target.

The third mission, Greed, will see players travel to Dubai, where they will have to infiltrate a skyscraper owned by a billionaire who has been accused of tax evasion. The mission will involve stealing documents and planting evidence to bring the target to justice.

The remaining missions in the DLC will focus on Sloth, Lust, Envy, and Pride, and each will present its own unique challenges and gameplay mechanics.

The new Hitman 3 DLC promises to be a worthy addition to an already exceptional game, and fans of the series are eagerly waiting to experience the Seven Deadly Sins in all their glory. Get ready to sin, because Agent 47 is back, and he is more lethal than ever!
