# Discover the Secret to Recovering Deleted WhatsApp Messages Before it's Too Late!

WhatsApp is undoubtedly one of the most popular messaging applications in the world, with over two billion active users every month. It is available on all major platforms and is widely used by individuals, businesses, and organizations for communication purposes. However, users often end up accidentally deleting their important WhatsApp messages, and this can be distressing. Luckily, there is a way to recover deleted WhatsApp messages before it's too late. Let's delve into how you can achieve this with ease.

## Enable WhatsApp Auto-Backup

One of the primary steps to recover deleted messages is to ensure that you enable auto-backup on WhatsApp. WhatsApp offers a weekly auto-backup service that stores your messages on Google Drive or iCloud, depending on your phone's operating system. To enable auto-backup on Android and iOS, follow the steps below:

**For Android Users**

1. Open WhatsApp and tap on the three dots in the top-right corner.
2. Go to Settings > Chat > Chat Backup.
3. Allow your WhatsApp to access your Google Drive account.
4. Under “Google Drive settings”, determine how often you want to back up WhatsApp messages, select a Google account and select if you want to include videos.
5. Tap on “Back Up Now” to start the process.

**For iOS Users**

1. Open WhatsApp and tap on the Settings icon at the bottom-right corner.
2. Select "Chats" > "Chat Backup."
3. Tap on "Auto Backup" and then select how frequently you want the app to backup your chats.
4. Choose "Back Up Now" to start the process.

With auto-backup enabled, you will be able to recover deleted messages in your WhatsApp chats in the event of inadvertent deletion or phone factory reset.

## Recover Deleted WhatsApp Messages from Google Drive or iCloud

If you have enabled auto-backup, you can recover deleted WhatsApp messages easily. However, it is worth noting that the restoration process only preserves the chats and attachments that were backed up on Google Drive or iCloud, and not the messages that were not backed up.

**For Android Users**

1. Uninstall the WhatsApp application from your phone.
2. Reinstall WhatsApp and launch it.
3. Verify your phone number.
4. Restore your WhatsApp chat history by tapping on "Restore" when prompted.

**For iOS Users**

1. Delete and reinstall WhatsApp from the App Store.
2. Begin the verification process by inputting your phone number.
3. When prompted, select "Restore Chat History" to recover your deleted WhatsApp messages from iCloud.

## Use Third-Party Software for Recovering Deleted WhatsApp Messages

If you have not enabled auto-backup, or the messages were not included in your backup, don't give up just yet. There are third-party software programs that can help you recover deleted WhatsApp messages. These programs are designed to scan your phone's memory to retrieve any deleted data that may still exist. They include:

1. EaseUS MobiSaver for Android and iOS
2. Dr. Fone for Android and iOS
3. Tenorshare UltData for Android and iOS
4. Gihosoft Free Android Data Recovery

These software programs come with detailed instructions on how to recover deleted WhatsApp messages. You will need to connect your device to your computer and run the software to scan your phone's memory. Once the scan is complete, the software will display a list of the recoverable data, and you can select the deleted WhatsApp messages you want to recover and click on Recover.

In conclusion, recovering deleted WhatsApp messages is easier than you think. You only need to enable auto-backup, restore chats from Google Drive or iCloud, or use third-party software programs to retrieve deleted WhatsApp messages. It is essential to note that enabling auto-backup and regularly backing up your chats is the best way to ensure that your data is safe and recoverable in case of an eventuality.
