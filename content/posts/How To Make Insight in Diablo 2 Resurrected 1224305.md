# Unleash the Secret Tricks to Unlock Insane Powers in Diablo 2 Resurrected - Discover How to Make Insight Like a Pro!

Diablo 2 Resurrected is a game with a rich history and loyal fanbase. It is a game that requires strategy, wit, and cunning to succeed. And one of the most critical aspects of the game is understanding how to unlock the game's insane powers. This article will explore some of the secret tricks to help players find and make Insight like a pro.

## What is Insight?

Insight is a runeword that can be created by inserting runes into a 4 socket polearm or stave. This powerful runeword grants an aura that restores mana to the player and also happens to be the most popular runeword among casters in Diablo 2 Resurrected. The aura makes casting spells in the game so much easier, with a significant increase in the rate at which the player's mana regenerates. Insight is arguably the most potent weapon in a caster's arsenal, and as you might expect, creating it requires some work.

## Finding the Runes

The first step in making the Insight runeword is getting the runes required. To make Insight, players need a Ral rune, a Tir rune, a Tal rune, and a Sol rune. Each of these runes can be found at different levels in the game, and some are rarer than others. For instance, the Tal rune can only be obtained from certain monsters in the game's late acts, while the Ral and Tir runes are more common.

To increase the odds of finding the necessary runes, players should adjust the difficulty level of the game. In harder modes, monsters drop more items, and rare items drop more frequently. Players can also explore areas of the game that contain monsters with a high level of magic resistance because these are the monsters that are likely to drop the necessary runes.

## Creating Insight

Once players have gathered all the necessary runes, the next step is to create the runeword. To create Insight: 

1. Find yourself a 4 socketed polearm or stave. 

2. Socket the Ral, Tir, Tal, and Sol runes into the weapon in that order. 

3. Voila! The weapon is now the Insight runeword.

It’s essential to note that the weapon must be ethereal to get the maximum bonus from the runeword. An ethereal weapon deals more damage than its non-ethereal counterpart, and it also increases the aura's rate of mana regeneration. So look for an ethereal polearm or stave if you can.

## Using Insight

After creating the Insight runeword, casters can bask in the glory of their new and improved powers. The runeword creates a powerful aura that restores the user's mana quickly, which is extremely useful for spellcasters. With Insight in hand, spellcasters can cast spells more often and use even more powerful spells without worrying about running out of mana.

The Insight runeword can also be used by non-casters, such as mercenaries, who can significantly benefit from the improved mana regeneration. So any player can create Insight to make mana regeneration less of a headache while playing.

## Conclusion

Creating the Insight runeword is no easy feat, and finding the required runes can take time and effort. But, in the end, the resulting bonus is worth it as players unlock insane powers and bask in the glory of the game’s most potent weapon. Using Insight in Diablo 2 Resurrected can make a huge difference in a player's success, so don't hesitate to unleash the secret arsenal of the game's most advanced players. With Insight in hand, players can cast spells with ease, battle monsters, and unlock the game's ultimate objectives.
