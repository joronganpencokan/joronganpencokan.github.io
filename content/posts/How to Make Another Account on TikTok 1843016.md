After creating your new account, it's time to customize it. You can add a profile picture, bio, and a username. Make sure to choose a username that reflects your new account's theme or content.

Step 4: Start creating content

Now that your second TikTok account is set up, it's time to start creating content. You can make videos that are different from your first account, or even collaborate with other TikTok users. You can also follow new people and explore different content that aligns with your new account.

Step 5: Switch between your accounts

Switching between your two TikTok accounts is easy. You just have to log out of one account and log in to the other. Simply tap on the "Me" icon, click on the three dots in the corner, and select "Manage accounts." From there, you can switch between your accounts with just one tap.
