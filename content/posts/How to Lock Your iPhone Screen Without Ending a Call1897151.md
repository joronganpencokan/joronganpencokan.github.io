##   How to Unlock Your iPhone Screen  
 

To unlock your iPhone’s screen, tap the screen once and then swipe up from the bottom to the top. Depending on your security settings, your iPhone may automatically unlock after scanning your face or it may require you to input a numerical code.

##   Why Does My iPhone Screen Turn Off During a Call?  
 

The iPhone’s built-in sensors automatically detect when the device is close to a surface, such as your face, and will turn the screen off. This automatic process doesn’t end phone calls and is primarily done to prevent the accidental opening of apps or pressing of on-screen buttons. It can also save battery life by not powering the screen when no one can see it.

 

Due to this screen feature, you don’t need to manually lock your iPhone screen before or during a phone call. The iPhone screen should turn off as soon as you hold the smartphone up to your ear and will automatically turn back on when you pull the iPhone away.

 
If your iPhone’s screen doesn’t turn back on during a phone call, tap the screen once or press the Side button.
