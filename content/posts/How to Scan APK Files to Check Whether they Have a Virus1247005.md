Normally, Android blocks every third-party app installation due to security reasons. Still, you can sideload Apk files on Android by enabling the ‘Unknown Sources’. The actual problem with the third-party app is that you never know whether the file is safe or not.
Before sideloading any Apk file on an Android, it’s always best to scan them first. Scanning with an online virus scanner ensures that files you are about to sideload don’t contain anything harmful.

The service is also pretty easy to use: upload the Apk file and hit the Scan button. If it finds any malware, it will immediately let you know.

Alternatively, you can install the VirusTotal Android app from the Google Play Store. The VirusTotal app for Android is entirely free, but it’s limited to scanning the apps you have already installed on your device.

 
### 2. Using MetaDefender



MetaDefender is another best online virus scanner on the list that you can consider. You need to upload an Apk file on the MetaDefender, and multiple Antivirus engines will scan your file.
Compared to VirusTotal, MetaDefender scanning is fast. Although it’s possible to scan files directly from the Android smartphone, using the MetaDefender website from a PC is more convenient.
The best thing about MetaDefender is that it can scan almost everything, including the URLs, Apk files, IP address, and more.
