## Lock Android with double tap
 
With a simple app called EasyLock, you can add the feature to lock the screen by double tapping. This app is an open source app that you cannot find on the Google Play Store. You have to download the APK and install it manually. Also, you don’t need a rooted device for this app to work. You can either download it directly from your device or download it and later copy it from your computer. Follow the steps below:
 
Step 1: Download EasyLock.
 
Step 2: Enable Unknown Sources if you have already done and install the APK.
 
Step 3: Run the app and grant any permission it asks.
 
Step 4: Now, return to the app to configure it. You can configure the app to run at startup and tinker the timeout duration among all the features.
 
Step 5: When you’ve configured it, tap on the switch to turn it on.
 
This app, by default, only locks the screen if you double tap on the status bar, but you can change this by enabling the option to work when double tapping anywhere on the screen. This may interface with your other gestures though. Note that if you want to uninstall the app, don’t uninstall like other apps. You need to first revoke the permissions, turn it off and then uninstall it.
