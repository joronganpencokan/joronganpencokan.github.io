Title: Unbelievable! Score Over $660 Worth of PC Games for Just $16!

Have you been on the hunt for new games to add to your PC collection? Have you been searching for deals and bundles that offer you the biggest bang for your buck? Look no further, as we have some exciting news to share with you!

Humble Bundle, a popular website known for its charity-focused game bundles, has just released a new bundle that is too good to pass up. For just $16, you can score over $660 worth of PC games, including highly-rated titles such as Tom Clancy's The Division, Assassin's Creed Origins, and Dead Rising 4.

In case you're not familiar with Humble Bundle, let us fill you in. They offer collections of games in "bundles" at discounted prices, with a portion of the proceeds going to various charities. You can choose how much of your payment goes towards the publishers, the Humble Bundle team, and the charities, making it a win-win for everyone involved.

This particular bundle, called the "Humble Montly Bundle for March 2021," includes 12 games in total. Along with the aforementioned titles, you'll also get access to titles like Wandersong, A Short Hike, and Unrailed. These games offer a variety of genres, from action and adventure to puzzle and strategy, ensuring there is something for everyone.

Another great thing about this bundle is that all of the games can be redeemed on Steam, a popular gaming platform for PC. Once you purchase the bundle, you'll be given individual Steam keys for each game that you can redeem and start playing immediately.

But you better act fast – this deal won't last forever. The Humble Monthly Bundle is only available until March 5th, so if you want to get your hands on these games, you'll need to act quickly.

If you're a fan of PC gaming and love snagging deals, the Humble Monthly Bundle is definitely something you should be on the lookout for. It's a great way to not only expand your game collection but to also give back to charities in the process. So what are you waiting for? Head over to Humble Bundle and score this unbelievable deal while it lasts!

Technically, it's a pay as you want, but $16 is the minimum to get these games. The amount you pay will go to a great cause – the Covenant House, a nonprofit that helps homeless children and youth.
If you've been meaning to travel to Rapture, now is your chance to do so. Among some of the major games involved in the deal include the entire BioShock collection, so you'll get BioShock, BioShock II, and BioShock Infinite offering hours of immersive gameplay in the underwater city.
You'll also get top hits like the strategy game Civilization VI where you can conquer the world in turn-based gameplay. But, if you just want to shoot aliens without worrying too much about plot points or strategy, Borderlands 3 Super Deluxe is also included in this deal. You can go enjoy some quality time with Tiny Tina and Claptrap while driving around exploding everything in your wake. Other games bundled into this great deal included games like Mafia: Definitive Edition and XCOM Ultimate.
If this is a deal you've been waiting for, you have time to grab it. While it began today, if you need to wait until payday to contribute to a worthy cause, you have until September 21 to score all these games for such a low price.
