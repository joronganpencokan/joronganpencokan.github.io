Exposed: How Private Eye is Selling Your Private Info Online- Here's The Ultimate Guide to Remove Your Personal Data!

In this digital age, the protection of our personal data and online privacy has become a critical issue. It is no longer news that companies are collecting and selling our information online to advertisers, marketers, and other third parties. Private Eye, a UK-based investigative company, has been accused of selling people's private information without their consent. This is a severe breach of privacy, and many people are looking for ways to remove their personal data from Private Eye's databases. In this article, we will discuss how Private Eye operates and provide an ultimate guide to removing your private information from their platform.

How Private Eye operates

Private Eye is a well-known investigative company in the UK. They offer various services, including credit checks, background checks, and even genealogy services. They also provide a wide range of information, such as criminal records, financial records, and personal details. Unfortunately, they have been accused of trading in people's private data, which has caused significant concern among individuals and advocacy groups alike.

Private Eye's practice of selling private data is not uncommon in the UK. Many companies trade in people's personal data and income by creating profiles, behaviors, and buying power that allow marketers to tailor their advertising strategies. However, Private Eye's activities have garnered significant attention since they are supposed to be an investigative company whose primary focus is to provide individuals with access to data they need to make informed decisions.

How to Remove Your Personal Data from Private Eye

If you are concerned about your personal data being sold by Private Eye, there are ways to remove it from their databases. Here are some steps to follow:

Step 1: Gather information

Gather all the information you would like to remove from Private Eye's databases. This should include your full name, date of birth, and any other information you may have provided to them. If you are unsure of what Personal data they have on you, you can submit a subject access request (SAR) to Private Eye, which obliges them to provide you with all the information they are holding against you.

Step 2: Submit an Opt-out Request

To remove your personal data from Private Eye, the first step is to submit an opt-out request using their online form or via email. You should provide sufficient information to enable them to locate your data and remove it from their database. This should include your full name, address, date of birth, and any other information you feel is necessary. It is best not to leave any information gaps so that they can quickly locate your information.

Step 3: Follow Up

After submitting an opt-out request, you will need to follow up to ensure your data has been removed. Private Eye has a 21-day window to remove your data from its databases after you submit the opt-out request. After the 21 days have elapsed, you can either use their online form or email them to follow-up and confirm that your data has been removed.

Conclusion

Private Eye's sale of personal data is a significant violation of people's privacy. It is crucial that we protect our personal data in this digital age, and removing it from platforms that trade in it is a crucial step. We hope this guide has provided you with the steps you can take to remove your data from Private Eye's databases. Remember to always monitor how your personal data is being used online and take steps to protect it.

Because people search sites get their information from public records and data brokers, this is all legal. Tap or click here for more information on how these sites operate.
Just because it’s legal doesn’t mean you have to stand for it. Opt-out Tuesday is our weekly series in which we guide you on removing yourself from people search sites. This week we’ll show you how to opt out of Private Eye.

 
## Avoid people search sites at all costs, especially if it costs you


Before we get to the steps, a reminder: Don’t ever pay for any people search service. Many of these sites are scammy in nature. You may think you’re paying for one report and find that you’ve been roped into recurring charges.
Don’t pay to remove your information from any site, either. This process must be provided for free.
Finally, be very careful which links you click. They’re often ads that lead you to another site that requests payment. We’ll provide accurate links to remove yourself from these sites with each Opt-out Tuesday report. If a button or link redirects you to another site, your best bet is to close out and start again.

 
## Not just for friends or relatives


People search sites advertise themselves as useful tools for finding long-lost loved ones, but the truth is anyone can use their services. A jealous ex, a hacker, a scammer — these sites don’t discriminate against their clientele. 
Private Eye’s FAQ states that its database contains more than 10 billion records. They also say records are never deleted and are continuously added and updated.
“Every time an individual moves, and a new address is reported, it is added to the database. The old address remains in the database as well. We have records dating back to the early 1980s which equates to a nearly 40-year address history for some individuals.” Yikes. 

 
## Fire this private eye
