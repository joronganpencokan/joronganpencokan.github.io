Hit battle royale game Fortnite came to Android well over a year ago now, but playing it hasn’t always been the simplest thing to do, even though the game is now in Chapter 2. You don’t download the game from the Google Play Store (most likely because Epic didn’t want to give Google a cut of its in-app purchases), so you need to sideload the game using the Epic Games App (also unavailable on the Play Store).
 
But don’t worry. It’s not that complicated, thanks to our quick guide that will show you how to install Fortnite on Android.
 
Before you start, the first thing you need to know is that Fortnite is quite a demanding game for smartphones. Your phone will need to meet the following technical criteria:
 
- 64-bit Android on ARM64 processor,
 - Android 8.0 or higher,
 - 4GB RAM,
 - GPU: Adreno 530 or higher, Mali-G71 MP20, Mali-G72 MP12 or higher.

 
If your phone meets these criteria, then follow the below steps:
 
First, go to fortnite.com/android on your Android phone, then tap “Get it on the Epic Games App”.
 

 
This will download the Epic Games app through which you can download Fortnite.
 
Note: You may be asked to give permission to Chrome to download apps from unknown sources. If your phone asks, tap Settings then “Allow from Source” to permanently allow unknown sources to be download from Chrome.
 
Once you’ve download the Epic Games app APK, install it and open the app. The first thing that appears should be a big picture of Fortnite. Tap it, then tap Install, and you’re away!
