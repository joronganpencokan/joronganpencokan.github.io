Unlock The Ultimate Arsenal: Pro Tips To Level Up Your Guns In MW2 Like A Pro!

Are you tired of constantly getting outgunned and feeling like you’re not able to compete with other players in Modern Warfare 2? Fear not, because with a little bit of knowledge and practice, you too can level up your guns like a pro and dominate the battlefield.

Here are some tips to unlock the ultimate arsenal and become a force to be reckoned with:

1. Choose Your Weapon Wisely

One of the key aspects of leveling up your guns is choosing the right weapon to suit your playing style. Each weapon in MW2 has its own unique set of strengths and weaknesses, so be sure to experiment with different ones to discover which works best for you. Whether you prefer a fast-firing submachine gun or a long-range sniper rifle, there’s a weapon that can cater to your needs.

2. Practice Makes Perfect

It’s essential to practice using your chosen weapon consistently to improve your accuracy and aim. Start by using it in local matches to get a feel for the recoil and timing of the gun, and gradually work your way up to playing in online matches. Try to use the gun exclusively for a few games to really hone your skills with it.

3. Use Attachments and Perks

Attachments and perks are key components to leveling up your guns. Attachments such as the red dot sight or grip can improve accuracy and reduce recoil, while perks like Stopping Power or Sleight of Hand can give you an edge over your opponents. Be sure to experiment with different combinations to find the best setup for you.

4. Play Objective-Based Modes

Playing objective-based modes like Domination or Search and Destroy can not only help you level up your guns but also your overall gameplay skills. These modes require teamwork and strategy, which can help you get a better understanding of the map layout and player behavior.

5. Learn From Your Mistakes

Finally, one of the most important aspects of leveling up your guns is learning from your mistakes. Take note of what works and what doesn’t, whether it’s a certain attachment that improves your accuracy, or a particular play style that allows you to dominate the game. Use this knowledge to refine your playstyle and improve your overall skill level.

In conclusion, leveling up your guns in MW2 requires dedication, practice, and a willingness to learn. Use these tips to unlock the ultimate arsenal and become a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. Happy fragging!

### Invasion Mode – Fastest way to Level Up Weapons
 
To rank up your guns fast, Invasion mode is the best right now, just because getting XP from killing AI-controlled bots also counts. So, if you are facing difficulty taking down players, you can simply focus on the bots to level up your weapon quicker.
 
Invasion Mode is a 20vs20 battle where there will be bots on every team along with real players. It’s like a Deathmatch where you need to eliminate members of the enemy team, and it also includes a tank and a Humvee. The goal is for one team to get to 1000 points by killing enemies/enemy vehicles/aircraft and enemy Bots. As the game says – Eliminate the enemy at all costs.
 
The bots you are looking for will appear in the enemy spawn area or they can be seen dropping from enemy airplanes. You can camp in a building/roof or an area where bots are showing up frequently and take them down one by one.
 
As you keep getting kills, you will see the notification on the screen that your weapon has leveled up.
 
That’s how to speed up your weapon progression in COD MW2. Hopefully, this trick comes in handy to level your guns faster so that you can unlock those awesome camo challenges.
