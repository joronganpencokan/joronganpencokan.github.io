Do you find yourself frustrated with slow message delivery on your Android device? Do you feel like you're spending more time waiting for messages to send than actually communicating with your friends and family? If so, don't worry because you're not alone! Slow message delivery is a common problem that many Android users face. However, there's an ingenious hack that you can use to unlock super-fast messaging – and it's surprisingly easy to do. 

All you need to do is follow these simple steps:

1. First, open the messaging app on your Android device.
2. Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen.
3. Select 'Settings' from the dropdown menu.
4. Scroll down to the 'Advanced' section and click on 'SMS Messaging.'
5. Find the option labeled 'Use HTTP/UTF-8 encoding for SMS messages' and turn it on.

That's it! By enabling this option, you'll be using a more efficient messaging format that will help your messages reach their destination faster. HTTP/UTF-8 encoding is a newer, more efficient way of transmitting data over the internet, and it can make a big difference in the speed of your messaging.

Now, you might be wondering why this option isn't enabled by default. Well, it turns out that not all mobile carriers support HTTP/UTF-8 encoding. So, if you're using a carrier that doesn't support this option, you may not see any improvement. But, it's definitely worth a try!

Additionally, you may also want to consider using a messaging app that has built-in HTTP/UTF-8 support, such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or Signal. These apps are designed to use the most efficient messaging formats and have some of the fastest delivery times around.

In conclusion, if you're tired of slow message delivery on your Android device, try enabling the 'Use HTTP/UTF-8 encoding for SMS messages' option. It might not work for everyone, but it's certainly worth a shot. And, if you really want lightning-fast messaging, consider switching to a messaging app that supports HTTP/UTF-8 encoding. With a bit of experimentation, you'll be messaging at lightning-fast speeds in no time!

Your Android phone only comes with a basic clipboard function. While you can copy a message and paste it on another app, you can only do it one message at a time. As soon as you copy a message, the previous one gets replaced. If you are a Gboard user, you will be glad to know that it comes with a native clipboard function. Its Clipboard feature can save your messages so you can easily access your clipboard history and paste it on an app. It can also store them all on the Gboard app to be used later.
 
## Using the Gboard Clipboard Function
 
On your Android phone, open any app that allows you to write a message. Click on the editing field to bring up the Gboard app.
 
Tap on the Clipboard icon in the top row. If the Clipboard icon is not there, click on the three dots in the top corner. This will reveal additional tools. Tap on the Clipboard icon when you see it.
 
If your clipboard is off, tap on the toggle button near the top to activate it.
 
You will find your messages history on the clipboard. Gboard saves all messages typed in the last hour and doesn’t provide an option to change the duration. Tap on a message to paste to the editing field.
 
You can also pin a particular message to the clipboard to prevent it from being overwritten. Press and hold down on the message for a few seconds, and tap on the pin icon when it appears onscreen.
 
To delete a message from the clipboard, select it and click on the Trash icon near the top of the page.
 
To add a new message to the clipboard, you can click on the Pen icon near the top. A plus sign (+) will appear. Click on the plus sign to create a new message.
 
If you don’t want the clipboard to store your messages, you can turn off the function by toggling the button at the top.
 
## Conclusion
 
Google has been adding plenty of features to Gboard, including the ability to type morse code, translate handwriting into text and create your own GIF emoji.  While its Clipboard feature is not new, it is hidden from plain view, and not many people know about it. Now you can easily make use of this feature to copy and paste messages in your app.
