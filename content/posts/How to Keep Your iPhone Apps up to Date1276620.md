Are you tired of your iPhone apps slowing down or crashing? Do you wish there was a secret formula to keeping them running like new? Well, look no further! We have compiled a list of our top tips to help you unlock the secret to keeping your iPhone apps running smoothly.

1. Close Out of Unused Apps: One of the easiest ways to keep your iPhone running smoothly is by closing out of apps that you aren't currently using. When you leave apps running in the background, they continue to use your phone's resources, which can cause your phone to slow down or even crash.

2. Monitor Your Phone's Storage: Another factor that can affect your phone's performance is its storage capacity. If your phone is low on storage, it can slow down your apps and your phone's overall performance. To prevent this, make sure to regularly review how much space you have left on your phone and delete any apps or files that you no longer need.

3. Keep Your Phone Updated: It's important to keep your iPhone and its apps up to date with the latest software updates. These updates often include bug fixes and performance improvements, which can help keep your apps running smoothly.

4. Clear Your Phone's Cache: Over time, your phone's cache can accumulate a large amount of data, which can slow down your apps and your phone's performance. To prevent this, regularly clear your phone's cache by going to Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data.

5. Disable Background App Refresh: Background App Refresh is a feature that allows apps to update and download content in the background, even when you're not using them. While this feature can be convenient, it can also slow down your phone's performance. To disable it, go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and toggle it off.

6. Restart Your Phone: If your phone is running slowly or if your apps are crashing, try restarting your phone. This can help clear up any temporary issues that may be causing your apps to run poorly.

In conclusion, by following these top tips, you can unlock the secret to keeping your iPhone apps running like new. Remember to regularly close out of unused apps, monitor your phone's storage, keep your phone and its apps updated, clear your phone's cache, disable background app refresh, and restart your phone when necessary. With these tips, you can ensure that your iPhone apps run smoothly and efficiently for years to come.

There are lots of reasons to keep iPhone apps up to date. On the fun side, new versions of apps deliver great new features. A less fun — but maybe more important— reason is that app updates fix bugs that address things like crashes and security issues. There are a few ways to keep iPhone apps updated, from manual techniques to automatic settings so that you never have to think about updates again.

 
##   Update iPhone Apps With App Store  
 

The most common way to keep apps updated on your iPhone is with the built-in App Store app. To do this, tap the Updates tab in the bottom menu and choose Update All to update the apps that require updates. You can also select UPDATE next to any app to update only that app.

 
Some of these directions apply to all iPhones but some are only relevant to specific versions of the software. These differences are pointed out below.
 
##   Enable Automatic Updates for iPhone Apps  
 

Ever since iOS 7, the iPhone has been able to update apps automatically whenever developers release a new version. This means you never have to tap the update button again; just enjoy the most current apps all the time.

 
Most apps have extensive details on what will update with the latest app version. Tap more to read the version history for that app.
 

This is great in terms of efficiency, but if you're not careful it can also result in downloading large files over cellular networks, which can quickly use up your monthly data limit.

 

Here's how to turn on automatic app updates and conserve your data:

 
- Open the Settings app and go to iTunes & App Store.
 - In the Automatic Downloads section, turn on the Updates toggle switch to enable auto-updating for apps.
 - Turn off the Use Cellular Data toggle switch to make sure app updates only download when the device is connected to Wi-Fi.

 
##   Use iTunes to Update iPhone Apps  
 

If you spend a lot of time in iTunes, update your apps in iTunes and sync them to your iPhone.

 

Open the Settings app and go to iTunes & App Store.

 

In the Automatic Downloads section, turn on the Updates toggle switch to enable auto-updating for apps.

 

Turn off the Use Cellular Data toggle switch to make sure app updates only download when the device is connected to Wi-Fi.

 
The cellular option also applies to other automatic updates that may be enabled, like for music and books. If you need cellular data for any of those features, disable auto-downloads for Updates so that the cellular option can be enabled. Song and book downloads are fairly small, while app updates might be hundreds of megabytes.
 
- From iTunes, select the icon for apps in the upper-left corner of the window. Or, go to View > Apps.
 - Select Updates in the row of buttons near the top. This lists the apps on your computer with available updates. This list may be different from what you see on your iPhone because it includes every app you've ever downloaded, not just the ones currently installed on your phone.
 - If you've updated the apps on your iPhone and haven't synced the phone with your computer, iTunes won't know that you don't need the update.
 - Choose an app to get more details about the update, and select Update to get the latest version. To update every app, select Update All Apps.

 
##   Background App Refresh  
 

There's another way to keep your apps updated: Background App Refresh. This feature, introduced in iOS 7, doesn't download the latest version of an app but instead refreshes apps with new content so that you always have the latest information. This isn't the same as updating the app, but it's still very useful.

 
This option isn't available in recent versions of iTunes, so it's only relevant on old versions of iTunes (prior to version 12.7).
 

From iTunes, select the icon for apps in the upper-left corner of the window. Or, go to View > Apps.

 

Select Updates in the row of buttons near the top. This lists the apps on your computer with available updates. This list may be different from what you see on your iPhone because it includes every app you've ever downloaded, not just the ones currently installed on your phone.

 
If you've updated the apps on your iPhone and haven't synced the phone with your computer, iTunes won't know that you don't need the update.
 

Choose an app to get more details about the update, and select Update to get the latest version. To update every app, select Update All Apps.

 

If Background App Refresh is turned on for the Twitter app, for example, and you always check Twitter while eating breakfast at 7 AM, the phone learns this pattern and, if the feature is turned on, refreshes your Twitter feeds before 7 AM so that you see the most up-to-date content when you launch the app.

 

Here's how to turn on Background App Refresh:

 
- Open Settings and go to General > Background App Refresh.
 - Tap Background App Refresh.
 - Choose Wi-Fi to have Background App Refresh enabled on when you're on a Wi-Fi network.
 - Choose Wi-Fi & Cellular Data to also use this feature with your mobile data plan.
 - Background App Refresh uses your monthly cellular data. If you're concerned about that but still want to use the feature, set it to Wi-Fi only. It can be a serious battery drain, so if battery life is important to you, keep it turned off.
 - Tap the arrow at the top left of the screen to see all the apps for which Background App Refresh can be enabled.
 - Tap the button next to any of the listed apps to enable Background App Refresh.
