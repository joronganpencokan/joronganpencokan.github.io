# Save Your Ears: Discover the Life-Changing Solution to Normalizing Volume on Windows 11!

Have you ever experienced sudden audio blasts when switching from one video or audio content to another on your Windows 11 computer? Has it ever startled you or made you jump out of your seat? If so, you might be one of the many Windows 11 users who are struggling to keep a consistent volume level across their streaming, gaming, or music sessions.

While loud sounds may give you an adrenaline rush, they can also harm your hearing and cause permanent damage to your ears. Fortunately, there's a life-changing solution to this problem that you might not be aware of—normalizing the volume on your Windows 11 device.

In this article, we'll explore what volume normalization is, how it works, and how you can enable it on your Windows 11 computer.

## What is Volume Normalization?

Volume normalization is a feature that evens out the volume levels of different audio tracks, so they have a consistent output. For instance, if you're watching an action movie with lots of explosions and sudden noises and then switch to a dialogue-driven scene, volume normalization will ensure that you don't have to adjust the volume manually.

Many media players, such as VLC or iTunes, have built-in volume normalization features. However, Windows 11 doesn't offer this option by default, which can be frustrating for users who frequently switch between different audio and video content.

## How Does Volume Normalization Work?

Volume normalization uses a process called Dynamic Range Compression (DRC), which compresses the dynamic range of an audio track, making the louder parts softer and the softer parts louder. This process aims to reduce the difference between the quietest and loudest parts of an audio file, resulting in a more consistent sound.

In other words, volume normalization uses an algorithm that analyzes the audio frequency, volume, and dynamic range of each track and adjusts it accordingly, so it matches the average loudness of all the other tracks in a playlist.

## How to Enable Volume Normalization on Windows 11

Now that you understand what volume normalization is and how it works let's see how you can enable it on your Windows 11 computer.

Firstly, you'll need to download a third-party media player that supports volume normalization, as Windows 11 doesn't have this feature by default. Some popular options include VLC, Foobar2000, or MusicBee.

Once you've installed your media player, open it, and follow these steps:

1. Go to Settings or Preferences
2. Look for Audio or Sound settings
3. Find the option to enable volume normalization
4. Check the box to activate it
5. Adjust the intensity or threshold of the normalization to your liking

After enabling volume normalization, you should notice a significant improvement in your audio experience. No more jarring audio blasts or the need to adjust the volume manually every time you switch to a new track.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, volume normalization is a life-changing solution that can save your ears from potential damage and create a better audio experience on your Windows 11 device. By enabling this feature, you can enjoy a consistent volume level across different audio and video content and avoid sudden loud noises that may harm your hearing. So, give it a try and normalize your volume today!

On Windows 11, you probably notice that the audio plays at different levels when playing videos or music on your computer. You may also have experience commercials playing louder than the stream you are watching. 
 
Typically, you would adjust the volume manually for each content, but this can quickly become annoying. However, if you are dealing with different sound levels in videos or any other type of content with audio, you can quickly normalize the audio on Windows 11 to have a consistent sound volume level across applications and web browsers.
 
In this guide, you will learn the steps to normalize the output sound on Windows 11.
 
## Normalize volume on Windows 11
 
To change the sound settings to normalize the volume on Windows 11, use these steps:
 
- Open Settings on Windows 11.
 - Click on System.
 - Click on Sound.
 - Under the “Output” section, select the speakers setting.
 - Under the “Output settings” section, turn on the Enhance audio toggle switch.
 - Click the Advanced option.
 - Click the Enhancements tab.
 - Check the “Loudness Equalization” option to normalize the volume on Windows 11.
 - Click the Apply button.
 - Click the OK button.

 
Once you complete the steps, you should now be able to watch shows online or listen to music with a consistent volume level on Windows 11. In addition, you can also use the “Loudness Equalization” option to boost sound volume, even when you max it out, and you’re still hearing things too low.
 
Open Settings on Windows 11.
 
Click on System.
 
Click on Sound.
 
Under the “Output” section, select the speakers setting.
 

 
Under the “Output settings” section, turn on the Enhance audio toggle switch.

Check the “Loudness Equalization” option to normalize the volume on Windows 11.
 
Click the Apply button.
 
Click the OK button.
 
It is important to note that most media applications include some sort of “loudness equalization” or “volume normalization” feature. However, Windows 11, similar to previous versions, features an option that allows normalizing the audio for the entire system.
