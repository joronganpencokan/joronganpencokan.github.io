Are you tired of the high mobile data bills you receive every month? Are you aware that you might be wasting hundreds or even thousands of dollars annually on data plans? Here's the shocking truth about your mobile usage that the telecom providers don't want you to know. 

Let's start by taking a look at how data plans work. We all know that data plans come in various packages, with varying amounts of data allowances, and at different prices. However, what most people don't know is that the telecom providers are very good at designing packages that almost always leave their customers with unused data, which ultimately goes to waste. 

According to a study conducted by the ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index), the average American spends approximately $100 per month on their mobile bill. Out of that $100, only about $10 is spent on actual phone calls and text messages, while the rest goes towards data usage. It's shocking to note that most people don't use up their data allowance and end up losing a substantial amount of money. 

Another critical factor is the ever-increasing use of Wi-Fi. Most people are oblivious to the fact that a significant amount of data they pay for is used when connected to Wi-Fi. That's because most mobile devices automatically connect to cellular data when Wi-Fi is weak or unavailable. 

Fortunately, there are several things you can do to save on data plans. First, consider switching to a more cost-effective data plan that matches your usage. Most people don't need unlimited data unless they consume a lot of data-heavy content daily. 

Secondly, turn off cellular data when you're connected to Wi-Fi to avoid using up your data allowance unknowingly. Most mobile devices have an option to disable cellular data, and it's a great way to save money. 

Thirdly, regularly check your data usage and plan to avoid any surprises at the end of the month. It's essential to be mindful of your data consumption to avoid running out of data or underutilizing your plan. 

In conclusion, telecom providers are in business, and their main goal is to make a profit. However, as consumers, it's essential to be aware of the tricks used to create data packages, which result in overspending on mobile bills. Start practicing these saving tips and begin saving hundreds of dollars monthly, which could be used towards other essential expenses or savings.
