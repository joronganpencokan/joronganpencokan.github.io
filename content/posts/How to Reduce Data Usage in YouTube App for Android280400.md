# Discover the Surprising Hack to Slash Your Data Usage on YouTube App For Android!

In this digital age, we are highly reliant on the internet for our entertainment, information, and communication needs. And one of the most sought-after sources of entertainment is YouTube, the world's largest video-sharing platform. But with the increasing consumption of high-quality videos, data usage on YouTube has become a major concern worldwide. Especially for the Android users, who often rely on mobile data, excessive data usage can cause a significant dent in their pockets. But worry not, there is a surprising hack that can help you slash your data usage on the YouTube app for Android. Let's explore it!

## The Problem

Before we dive into the solution, let's first understand the problem. When you stream videos on YouTube, the app automatically selects the highest available quality video based on your device and the network conditions. This means that if you are on mobile data, the app will select the highest quality video that your mobile data can handle, thereby consuming a large amount of data. Moreover, the auto-play feature of YouTube continuously loads and plays videos without your intervention, further adding to your data usage.

## The Solution

The good news is that you can override YouTube's default video quality settings and set a limit for your data usage. And it's surprisingly easy to do so. Here's how you can do it in a few simple steps:

### Step 1: Open the YouTube App

Open the YouTube app on your Android device.

### Step 2: Tap on Your Profile Picture

Tap on your profile picture icon located at the top-right corner of the app.

### Step 3: Tap on Settings

Scroll down the menu and tap on Settings.

### Step 4: Tap on General

Under the Settings menu, tap on General.

### Step 5: Tap on Limit Mobile Data Usage

Scroll down and tap on Limit Mobile Data Usage.

### Step 6: Choose Your Preferred Video Quality

You will see a list of video quality options. Choose the video quality that suits your data usage needs. If you want to conserve more data, select a lower quality option.

### Step 7: Enable Autoplay

If you want to conserve more data, you can also disable Autoplay by toggling it off. This will ensure that videos do not play continuously, further reducing your data usage.

And that's it! By following these simple steps, you can limit your data usage on the YouTube app for Android without compromising on your entertainment needs.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, excessive data usage on YouTube can be a major concern for Android users who rely on mobile data. But with this surprising hack, you can easily slash your data usage on the YouTube app without compromising on your entertainment needs. So, the next time you open the YouTube app on your Android device, remember to follow these simple steps to save your data and money!
