Step 3: Apply the coupon code.

To apply a coupon code, simply click on the "Apply" button next to it, and Honey will automatically enter the code into the coupon code box at checkout. You'll immediately see the savings reflected in your order total.

Step 4: Save big time.

That's it! With Honey, you'll never have to pay full price again. Thanks to its vast coupon database and smart technology, it's one of the best ways to unlock secret savings and get the best deals online.

In addition to Honey, there are other extensions you can use to find coupon codes and deals. For example, RetailMeNot, Coupons at Checkout, and Cently are all popular options. Each extension works slightly differently, so be sure to test out a few to find the one that works best for you.
