# Unleash Your Inner Hero with Gotham Knights! New Trailer Drops Bombshell: 4 Playable Characters and Co-Op Mode Confirmed!

DC fans have been eagerly anticipating the release of Gotham Knights, the latest addition to the Batman game franchise. And with the recent release of a new trailer, excitement has reached new heights. The trailer revealed some exciting new features that are sure to take the gaming experience to the next level.

One of the most exciting revelations is the confirmation of four playable characters. Players will have the option to play as Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, or Red Hood, each with their unique fighting style, weapons, and special abilities. As players progress through the levels, they will have access to upgrades and new gear that will help them take down the game's villains. 

The game's setting is post-Batman, with the caped crusader allegedly dead. Players will need to take on Gotham's criminal underworld in Batman's absence, and it seems they will have their work cut out for them. The trailer features a range of iconic villains, including Mr. Freeze and the Court of Owls.

However, the biggest shocker revealed in the new trailer is that the game will have a co-op mode, allowing players to team up with other heroes to take down Gotham's most dangerous threats. This new feature is a significant departure from the franchise's previous games, where players could only control Batman in a single-player campaign. Players can team up with friends online for a fun and immersive experience, adding a new dimension to the gameplay.

The co-op mode is especially exciting as it enables players to combine their abilities and coordinate their attacks, making each encounter more intense and challenging. Whether you prefer close combat or ranged attacks, the game's four playable characters offer a range of playstyles that cater to individual preferences.

The game retains the franchise's staple features, including an immersive storyline, stunning visuals, and high-quality voice acting. Gotham Knights embraces a fresh perspective that separates it from previous Batman games, and the decision to let players control multiple characters makes the action feel more diverse and engaging.

In conclusion, Gotham Knights is shaping up to be a must-play game for DC fans and gamers alike. With the confirmation of four playable characters, a co-op mode, and a range of iconic villains to take down, there's never been a better time to unleash your inner hero. Get ready to dive into Gotham's criminal underworld and prove your worth as a hero. The game is set for release in 2022 on all major consoles, so get ready to suit up and join the fight!

As it was confirmed earlier, WB Games Montreal just announced their new game: Gotham Knights. The entire game can be played solo, or in 2 player co-op in which each takes on the role of one of the Knights.
 
Bruce Wayne is dead and the Gotham Knights are taking over. The team consists of Robin, Batgirl, Red Hood, and Nightwing and in the first trailer, it became clear that we are taking on the Court of Owls and their Talons.
 
In fact, the trailer shows how Batman, after sending a video prepared in case of death, passes the responsibilities to four members of the Bat-Family as mentioned above. Also confirmed the presence of iconic enemies such as Mr. Freeze or the more recent Court of Owls.
 

 
The gameplay seems to be very close to the Arkham Saga, taking advantage of a new story (also very close to being consequential to the ending of Batman: Arkham Knight, but without confirming it for now) and this time without Batman, but otherwise, the enemies, as well as the management of the game seem to have adapted to a gameplay mechanics linked to the growth of the characters. The presenters have in fact revealed how the various heroes can be enhanced, improved, and (it seems) even the types of equipment can be changed (as seen by the aesthetic change of Batgirl during the videos).
 
The enemies also present a level above their head, as if to propose a sort of entry threshold (and perhaps maps capable of giving drops of some kind). Finally, from what you can see from the gameplay, it seems that other online players will be able to join one of the other heroes in your game.
 
In the pre-Alpha game footage that followed, the team took on Mr. Freeze. To get there, Batgirl drove to the site on a Batcycle and saw Robin using a Justice League satellite to teleport short distances. The gameplay footage was also shared via Twitter and can be viewed below:
 
Gotham Knights should be released in 2021, but for which platforms are still not yet known.
