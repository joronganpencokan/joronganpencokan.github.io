# Unleash The Power Of Hyrule: Learn How To Create The Ultimate Elixirs In Zelda: Breath Of The Wild!

Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an open-world action-adventure game where players take on the role of Link, a hero destined to save Hyrule from the clutches of Calamity Ganon. In this game, players can use a wide variety of weapons, armor, and consumables to aid them in their quest. One such consumable is the elixir, a powerful concoction that grants Link temporary boosts to his abilities. In this article, we will teach you how to create the ultimate elixirs in Zelda: Breath of the Wild!

## What are Elixirs?

Elixirs are powerful concoctions that grant temporary buffs to Link's abilities. These buffs can range from increasing his attack power and defense to granting him enhanced senses or resistance to certain types of damage. To create an elixir, players must combine ingredients with a cooking pot or a campfire.

## What Ingredients Do You Need?

To create an elixir, players need to gather ingredients from the environment around them. These ingredients can range from fruits and vegetables to monster parts and critters. Here are some common ingredients you can use to create elixirs:

- Apples, Bananas, and other fruits
- Spicy Peppers, Chillies, and other hot peppers
- Honey, Butter, and other sweeteners
- Monster Parts, such as Bokoblin Fangs, Moblin Guts, and Lynel Hooves
- Critters, such as Butterflies, Beetles, and Snails

## Combining Ingredients to Make Elixirs

To create an elixir, players need to combine ingredients with a cooking pot or a campfire. Here's how to create an elixir in both cases:

### Using a Cooking Pot

To use a cooking pot, players need to find one in the environment or purchase one from a store. Once they have a cooking pot, they need to light a fire underneath it using a wooden or metal weapon. Next, they need to gather the ingredients they want to use and place them in the cooking pot.

Each ingredient has an effect on the elixir's properties. For example, Spicy Peppers add heat-resistance to the elixir, while Monster Parts can add attack power or durability. As players add ingredients to the cooking pot, they can see the recipe's properties on the right side of the screen.

Once they've added all the ingredients they want, players need to heat the cooking pot by adding a flame, such as a torch, to the fire underneath it. The pot will heat up and start to boil, and eventually, the elixir will be complete. Players can then transfer the elixir to their inventory and drink it to gain the temporary buffs.

### Using a Campfire

In the absence of a cooking pot, players can use a campfire to create elixirs. To do this, they need to light a fire using a wooden or metal weapon and then place a cooking pot or a pan on top of the fire. Next, they need to gather the ingredients they want to use and place them in the pot or pan.

Just like with the cooking pot, each ingredient has an effect on the elixir's properties. Players can see the recipe's properties on the right side of the screen as they add ingredients to the pot or pan.

Once they've added all the ingredients they want, players need to wait for the elixir to cook. They can check on its progress by pressing the A button. Once the elixir is complete, players can transfer it to their inventory and drink it to gain the temporary buffs.

## Tips For Creating The Ultimate Elixirs

To create the ultimate elixirs, players need to experiment with different combinations of ingredients. Here are some tips to help them create the best elixirs possible:

- Focus on specific buffs: To create the most potent elixirs, players should focus on specific buffs like attack power, defense, or speed. They can do this by combining ingredients that have similar effects, such as Mighty Bananas and Lynel Guts for attack power.
- Use critters to enhance effects: Players can use critters like Butterflies and Dragonflies to enhance the effects of their elixirs. For example, adding a Fairy to an elixir will make it last longer.
- Use dragon parts for high-level elixirs: Players can use dragon parts, such as Dragon Horns and Dragon Fangs, to create high-level elixirs that last longer and grant more buffs.
- Cook during the Blood Moon: During the Blood Moon, all enemy monsters will respawn. This is the perfect time for players to gather fresh monster parts to use in their elixirs.
- Upgrade their cooking gear: By upgrading their cooking gear, players can increase the number of ingredients they can use at once, make elixirs last longer, and create more potent elixirs.

## Conclusion

Elixirs are a vital part of Link's toolkit in Zelda: Breath of the Wild. They allow him to gain temporary buffs that can help him face the challenges of the game's world. By experimenting with different ingredients and following the tips outlined in this article, players can create the ultimate elixirs and unleash the full power of Hyrule!

Need a short-term boost and protection from specific attacks or weather conditions in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild? Then you'll need to learn how to make elixirs in BOTW. If you're in bad environmental conditions or are facing a tough fight, elixirs might save you.

 
##   How to Make Elixirs in Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild  
 

All elixirs in Breath of the Wild are a combination of animal parts and monster parts. Get animal parts from catching or buying animals like butterflies, crickets, and frogs. Get monster parts by picking them up after killing monsters. Every elixir in Breath of the Wild has two critical attributes: effect and duration.

 
Use these elixirs in Breath of the Wild running on both the Switch and Wii U.
 
- Effect is what the elixir does. For example, the effect of a Chilly elixir is heat resistance. The animal used in the recipe determines its effect. If you base your potion on an animal with heat resistance, it will give you heat resistance. Check out the descriptions of animals in your inventory for more details.Duration is how long the elixir lasts. The monster parts you use dictate its length. Common monster parts offer short-term benefits, while rare ones last longer.

 

The effects of some elixirs in BOTW are all or nothing: they work. In other cases, the more animal parts you use, the stronger the effect, and the more monster parts you use, the longer it lasts.

 
##   Zelda: BOTW Elixir Guide  
 

Remember, for all of these elixirs, you need monster parts, too. When you've made an elixir, you take it the same way you eat meals.

 
Create elixirs by throwing the ingredients into cooking pots, the same way you cook food.
 
###   Chilly Elixir  
 

In the Gerudo desert or another sweltering place and need to cool down? Make a Chilly Elixir using animals with heat resistance like Winterwing Butterflies or Cold Darners.

 
###   Electro Elixir  
 

Is there a lightning storm, or are you fighting an Electric Lizalfos or Electric Wizzrobe? The short-term protection of an Electro Elixir will help. Make it using Electric Darners or Thunderwing Butterflies.

 
###   Enduring Elixir  
 

Need to climb a particularly tall wall or tower, or swim a long way, and worried you wouldn't last? Add extra stamina with an Enduring Elixir made from Restless Crickets or Tireless Frogs.

 
###   Energizing Elixir  
 

Are you climbing a wall or paragliding and running out of energy? Avoid plummeting to your doom by restoring your stamina wheels using an Energizing Elixir made from Restless Crickets.

 
###   Fireproof Elixir  
 

Facing a fiery foe like some kinds of Chuchus, Wizzrobes, or Lizalfos? Protect yourself with a Fireproof Elixir made from Fireproof Lizard.

 
###   Hasty Elixir  
 

Want to run or climb faster than normal? A Hasty Elixir made from Hot-Footed Frogs or Hightail Lizards will do the trick for a little while.

 
###   Hearty Elixir  
 

Heading into a big fight with an adamant foe (I'm looking at you, Silver Lynel)? Add extra hearts to increase your lifespan by making an elixir using Hearty Lizards or Fairies.

 
###   Mighty Elixir  
 

That tough fight we just mentioned? Don't just boost your hearts; increase the power of your attacks, too. Do it using a Mighty Elixir from Chuchu Jelly and Bladed Rhino Beetles.

 
###   Sneaky Elixir  
 

Need to stay stealthy when creeping around big monsters or on tricky missions? A Sneaky Elixir makes it harder for you to be spotted. Make one using Sunset Fireflies.

 
###   Spicy Elixir  
 

Heading into a snowy territory and don't have the cold-weather armor? Down a Spicy Elixir to boost your cold resistance. You'll need Warm Darners or Summerwing Butterflies.

 
###   Tough Elixir  
 

For some tough battles, you may want to increase your defense against enemy attacks. In that cases, use Rugged Rhino Beetles to create a Tough Elixir.
