# Exposed: The Shocking Truth About How To Erase Yourself From People Search Websites!

Are you tired of seeing your personal information being displayed on people search websites? Those sites can be invasive and harmful to your privacy, especially if they have your phone number, email, address, or other sensitive information.

But don't worry, there's a way to erase yourself from those websites, and it's not as complicated as you might think. In this article, we'll reveal the shocking truth behind people search websites and how to remove your information from them.

## Understanding People Search Websites

People search websites are online databases that collect and store personal information about individuals from public records and other sources. They use this data to create profiles, which they then publish on their websites for anyone to access.

These profiles typically include a person's full name, age, address, phone number, email, employment history, education, criminal records, and more. Some websites even include detailed reports on a person's financial and credit history, social media activity, and family members.

The problem with people search websites is that they can expose your personal information to strangers, marketers, scammers, and identity thieves. Moreover, they can invade your privacy, damage your reputation, and jeopardize your safety.

## Removing Your Information from People Search Websites

Now, the good news is that you can remove your information from people search websites, but it requires some effort and patience. Here are the steps you should follow:

1. Identify the Websites: Use a search engine or a people search engine to find out which websites are displaying your information. Make a list of all the sites and note down your information that appears on them.

2. Opt-Out: Most people search websites offer an opt-out feature that allows you to request the removal of your information from their databases. Look for the opt-out page or the contact information on each website, and follow the instructions to submit your removal request.

3. Verify Removal: It may take several weeks or months for the websites to process your removal request and remove your information from their databases. Therefore, it's essential to verify if your information has been removed by checking the website or using a people search engine.

4. Monitor Your Privacy: Once you've removed your information from people search websites, it's crucial to monitor your privacy regularly. Use a privacy tool or a monitoring service to alert you if your information appears on any new websites or databases.

## Conclusion

People search websites can be dangerous for your privacy and security, but you don't have to suffer from their intrusive practices. By following the steps above, you can erase yourself from those websites and take back control of your personal information.

Remember, the key to protecting your privacy is to be proactive, vigilant, and informed. Stay updated on the latest privacy threats and keep your personal information safe from prying eyes.

Some things you’ll find are just plain wrong, but there’s likely a lot of real info about you and your life floating around the web that you never realized — from your address to your relatives to where you work.
So, where does all this info come from? There’s an entire network of websites that keep tabs on you and offer the data to the highest bidder. These “people search” and data broker sites crawl across social media and public records to build detailed personal profiles.
If you care about your online privacy, deleting yourself from the sites below is a great place to start. We’ll show you how.

 
## How to opt out of the biggest data brokering websites


People search sites are in the business of building profiles based on public info scraped from across the internet. These profiles often contain sensitive data like phone numbers and addresses — and scam callers and mail spammers rely on these websites to scout prospects.
“Wait,” you might be thinking. “Is this legal?” It is, and data brokers are only able to get away it by giving people a chance to opt-out. Unfortunately, this is usually easier said than done. Many of these sites make you jump through hoops to delete yourself, with steps ranging from phone calls to faxing your driver’s license to prove who you are. 
We’ll show you how to remove your data from two of the biggest people search sites on the web. This includes Intelius, which owns multiple data brokering websites, and BeenVerified. If you are short on time, remove yourself from these two. If you have more time, keep scrolling to see the rest and complete those steps, too.
Intelius: This is one of the biggest data brokers on the web and owns a large chunk of people search sites like Classmates.com, iSearch, ZabaSearch, Peoplelookup, PublicRecords and many others. Previously, you had to fax your driver’s license to remove yourself, but the company has made the process much easier in recent years.
And best of all, if you remove yourself from Intelius, you remove yourself from all of the sites it controls.

 
To get started, click on this link and enter your name and email address.When you find your records, click Select and Continue.On the next page, enter your email address to confirm your identity and fill in the CAPTCHA code. Then, click Continue.Open your email and look for a message from the sender Intelius. Click the link inside to continue. Keep in mind the link will expire after 24 hours. If you don’t see the email in your inbox, check your spam folder.You will receive a confirmation email with a reference number once the process is complete. It can take up to 72 hours for the opt-out to fully process.After 72 hours have passed, look yourself up again on Intelius. If your information is still showing after you got your confirmation, send an email to CUSTSERV@intelius.com and include the confirmation number you received.


BeenVerified: This website is a major hub for people searches and probably contains a significant amount of information on you. This includes your full name, phone number and street address. To remove your information from BeenVerified completely, follow these steps:

 
Tap or click here to visit BeenVerified’s opt-out page and search via first name, last name and state. Click the green “Search” button. On the results page, you can filter by city and age if you don’t see yourself.When you find your listing, click to select it.On the Opt-out request page that opens, enter your email address and check the blue optional checkbox. Fill out the required fields and verify the captcha to prove you’re not automated. Then, click the green “Send Verification Email” box.Check your inbox and look for an email from the sender Privacy with the subject [BeenVerified] Opt-Out Verification.Open the email and click the link inside. This will bring you to a confirmation page. Removal won’t be immediate, however, so expect it to take several days to weeks before your information vanishes. 


InstantCheckmate: InstantCheckmate makes it easier than many other people search websites to remove your info. Fill out the form at the top of the page, select the records you wish to remove and follow the instructions that appear on-screen. The process can take up to 48 hours after opting out.
MyLife: MyLife requires you to make a phone call in order to verify you’re opting out. You may be asked to register for the site in order to make a claim to your data, which is normal. Just make sure not to buy anything that the representative asks you to. 
To get started, Call (888) 704-1900 and press 2 to begin the opt-out process.
Once you’ve confirmed your identity, let the agent know you wish to have your profile removed. You should also ask them to remove you from Wink.com since that site is owned by MyLife as well. 
Pipl: Pipl’s privacy policy outlines its processes and all of the ways the website collects its data. In addition, it also includes a link to an opt-out form you can fill out. Tap or click here to fill out and submit the form.
Once you’ve filled out the form, expect a follow-up email from Pipl asking you to confirm your identity. This process can potentially take several days.
Spokeo: Like Pipl, Spokeo features a dedicated page for opting out of your records being hosted. You will have to search for your profile on the site and copy the URL into the opt-out form to successfully process it.
Apollo.io: To remove yourself from this data broker site, tap or click this link. From there, enter your email address and your apollo.io profile URL to start the process.
White Pages: As with Spokeo, you’ll need to locate your profile using the search bar at the top of the website and paste the URL into the box on this page. You should also tap or click here to submit a support request to have your information removed. Choose I need to remove or edit a listing from the dropdown.
In your request, ask that your info is also removed from White Pages Premium. Sometimes removed listings only disappear from the basic White Pages unless you specify.
ZoomInfo: ZoomInfo has a specific page for opting out that requires you to fill out a form. Tap or click here to visit the page and provide your email address to begin the opt-out process. You should receive an email from ZoomInfo in your inbox with a code. Click the link in the email, type in the code it included and follow the on-screen instructions to opt-out.
This process, thankfully, only takes a few minutes — and you won’t have to wait several days for your data to vanish.
