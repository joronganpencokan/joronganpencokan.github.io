# Unleash Your Inner Assassin with This Unbeatable Hitman 3 Final Mission Walkthrough Guide!

Are you ready to become the ultimate assassin? Do you want to master the art of stealth and take down your targets with precision? Then, you must conquer the final mission of Hitman 3 like no one else.

The final mission, "Untouchable," is a challenging and difficult level that requires mastery of all the assassin tools and abilities in your arsenal. It tests your patience, creativity, and your ability to adapt to unexpected situations.

In this guide, we'll show you how to complete this mission in style and become the ultimate assassin.

## Step 1: Plan Your Way In

The first step in any good assassination mission is to plan your way in. In "Untouchable," you need to take down Alexa Carlisle, the matriarch of the Carlisle family. She's a formidable opponent, and her mansion is not easy to infiltrate.

To start your mission, approach the gate and wait for the guard to check your invitation. Once inside, you'll need to find a disguise to blend in with the staff.

There are several ways to obtain a disguise, but the easiest is to take out the gardener in the garden near the main entrance. His outfit will allow you to move around the mansion freely.

## Step 2: Scout Out the Area

Once inside, take some time to scout out the area. There are multiple ways to approach your target, but it's worth exploring the environment to find the perfect opportunity.

You can use the mansion's layout to your advantage, such as the chandelier in the main hall or the balcony overlooking Alexa's bedroom. Use your instinct to locate any weapons or useful items scattered around the mansion.

## Step 3: Eliminate Your Target

Now that you have your disguise and have scouted out the mansion, it's time to eliminate your target. There are several ways to do this, so choose the method that best suits your playstyle.

If you prefer a more direct approach, you can use a silenced pistol or a close-quarters weapon like a knife to take down Alexa. If you want to be more subtle, you can use poison to eliminate her in a less suspicious way.

Remember that time is of the essence in this mission. You may need to improvise if your initial plan doesn't go as expected.

## Step 4: Escape

After you've eliminated your target, it's time to make your escape. This is where your earlier scouting will come in handy. You can use the mansion's many exits and entries to slip away unnoticed.

If you're feeling daring, you can attempt to make a run for it through the main gate. Just be wary of any guards who may be suspicious of your actions.

## Conclusion

Completing the final mission of Hitman 3, "Untouchable," is not an easy feat, but with the right strategy and planning, you can become the ultimate assassin. It's all about using your environment to your advantage, improvising when things go wrong, and making a swift escape.

So, come on! Unleash your inner assassin with this unbeatable Hitman 3 final mission walkthrough guide!
