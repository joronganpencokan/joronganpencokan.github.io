This article explains how to export music from iTunes to a computer and make a hard disc backup of your media. With macOS Catalina, Apple renamed iTunes to Music. In this guide, we use the terms interchangeably.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- In the Preferences menu, select Files, then enable Copy files to iTunes/Music Media folder when adding to the library.Go to File > Library > Organize Library, enable the Consolidate Files option, then select OK to copy the files into one folder.Open a separate window, then drag the iTunes/Music folder from your computer to an external drive or the computer's hard disc.

 
##   Consolidate Your iTunes/Music Library Before Backup  
 

The media files that make up your iTunes library might not be contained in the same folder; they may be spread among multiple folders. This can complicate things because you will have to make sure that all of the folders on your hard drive are backed up, in addition to the iTunes music folder.

 

Fortunately, you can use the consolidation feature in iTunes to copy all of your media files into one folder. This process does not delete the original files found in other locations, and it makes sure that all of the media in your library will be copied.

 

Here's how to consolidate your iTunes library into one folder before backup, make sure iTunes is running and follow these steps:

 
- Open the iTunes/Music preferences window:
 - On a Mac computer, select the iTunes/Music menu, then select Preferences.On a Windows computer, select Edit > Preferences.
 - Select the Files tab and enable the option: Copy files to iTunes/Music Media folder when adding to the library if it is not already checked, then select OK.
 - Older versions of iTunes/Music may contain this option in the Advanced tab.
 - To view the consolidation screen, select the File menu, then select Library > Organize Library.
 - Enable the Consolidate Files option, then select OK to copy files into one folder.

 
##   Copy Your Consolidated iTunes/Music Library to External Storage  
 

Now that you've made sure all the files in your iTunes library are in one folder, you can copy the folder to an external storage device, such as a portable hard drive or disc. To do this you will have to make sure iTunes is not running. Quit the program and follow these steps:

 

Open the iTunes/Music preferences window:

 
- On a Mac computer, select the iTunes/Music menu, then select Preferences.On a Windows computer, select Edit > Preferences.

 

Select the Files tab and enable the option: Copy files to iTunes/Music Media folder when adding to the library if it is not already checked, then select OK.

 
Older versions of iTunes/Music may contain this option in the Advanced tab.
 

To view the consolidation screen, select the File menu, then select Library > Organize Library.

 

Enable the Consolidate Files option, then select OK to copy files into one folder.
