Speeding tickets can be a massive inconvenience, and they could land you in a lot of trouble. However, with advancing technology, there may just be a way out of a speeding ticket using an unlikely tool - your iPhone. By installing a shortcut on your phone, you could quickly protect yourself from receiving costly tickets and keep your driving record clean.

Here's how to use the shortcut:

First things first, there are certain preliminaries you need to follow. One of them is to make sure your iPhone is updated to the latest iOS version. You also need to have the Shortcuts app installed.

Once the Shortcuts app is installed, here is a step-by-step guide to set it up.

Step 1: Open the Shortcuts app on your iPhone.

Step 2: Tap the "+" in the top right corner to create a new shortcut.

Step 3: Tap “Add Action” to bring up a new screen.

Step 4: Search for the “Get Directions” action and add it to your shortcut.

Step 5: Enter your current location and your destination when prompted by the shortcut.

Step 6: Add another action by clicking on the “Plus” button.

Step 7: Scroll down and select the “Text” action.

Step 8: In the empty field, type in the message you want to send, such as “I’m running late.”

Step 9: Add another action by clicking on the “Plus” button.

Step 10: Scroll down and select the “Send Message” action.

Step 11: Enter the recipient’s phone number.

That’s it! You’ve created a shortcut that can quickly help you get out of a speeding ticket. Here’s how it works.

Say you get pulled over for speeding. All you need to do is activate the shortcut, which will automatically generate a message to send to a loved one or friend informing them that you’re running late. To activate the shortcut, ask Siri to “get directions to [your destination].” Once you have the directions, click on the shortcut and send the message to your selected contact.

By doing so, the message sent will have a timestamp that corresponds with the time you were pulled over. This evidence can be used to show that you were not trying to speed purposefully and your intention was to notify your loved one that you would be running late. This could help you avoid a fine or points on your driving record, allowing you to continue driving hassle-free.

In conclusion, you no longer need to worry about receiving speeding tickets with your iPhone by your side. By setting up this simple shortcut, you can quickly make your way out of any traffic violations by submitting a legitimate reason for your speed. Try it out today and see how it could help you keep your driving record up to date.

##   How to Get the 'I'm Getting Pulled Over' Shortcut  
 

The Shortcuts feature in iOS automates both basic and complex tasks to save time and make your phone usage more efficient. Along with creating your own 'Hey Siri, I'm getting pulled over' shortcuts, you can download ready-made shortcuts from the internet.

 

One pre-programmed shortcut comes courtesy of Robert Petersen, who created it to help people protect themselves during encounters with the police. Here's what it does and how to get it.

 

Before you can use Petersen's program, you need to tell your iPhone to allow "untrusted" shortcuts. These macros are ones that you get from the internet instead of inside the Shortcuts app. To adjust this setting, open the Settings app, select Shortcuts, and then tap the switch next to Allow Untrusted Shortcuts to on/green.

 

Now, you're ready to set up the "I'm Getting Pulled Over" shortcut. Here's what to do.

 
You must have run at least one Shortcut from the app before you can change this setting.
 
- Go to the Shortcut's post on Reddit to find a link to the most current version.
 - Open that link using Safari on your iPhone.
 - Tap Get Shortcut.
 - The Shortcuts app will open, and you'll see a list of everything it does. Scroll down to review all of its features.
 - At the bottom of the page, tap Add Untrusted Shortcut.
 - On the next screen, Choose one or more recipients, either by phone number or email. The people you designate in this step will receive your location when the shortcut runs. Tap Continue to save your recipient(s).
 - Tap the plus sign to choose from your contacts.
 - In the next step, choose more recipients. The people you choose here will get a copy of the video you take. You can select the same recipients as in the previous step or different ones.
 - Tap Done to finish setting up.
 - You'll return to the Gallery page of the Shortcuts app.
 - You may still need to grant some permissions before the shortcut will work properly. To start, open the Settings app.
 - Select Shortcuts.
 - Tap Location.
 - Chose the level of permission you want to grant the Shortcuts app. To save time when you're running the shortcut, chose While Using the App.
 - Return to the Shortcuts app and make sure you're on the My Shortcuts tab.
 - Tap the More (three dots) menu in the upper-right corner of the I'm getting pulled over shortcut.
 - Scroll down to Camera and tap Allow Access.
 - If you've already denied access to part of your phone, tap Shortcut Details and and flip the switch next to the items to on/green.
 - Tap OK in the small window that opens.
 - Repeat Steps 15 and 16 for Photos and Messages.
 - By default, this shortcut uses your front-facing camera, but you can also choose a different one. Tap Front under Camera and select Back if you'd rather use the other camera.
 - Use the front-facing camera if you're using the shortcut while your phone is in a dashboard mount. Use the rear camera if you plan to hold your phone while recording.
 - Finally, scroll down to the Scripting section to choose where to upload your video at the end of the shortcut. By default, you can use iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or a "Do not upload" option. Tap the minus button and then Delete to remove one or more options.
 - To use Dropbox with this shortcut, you'll have to grant permission.
 - Select Done to save your settings.
 - To run the program, either open the Shortcuts app and tap its button on the My Shortcuts screen, or activate Siri and say, "I'm getting pulled over."
