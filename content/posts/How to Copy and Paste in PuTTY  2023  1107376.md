As we enter the new year, it's important to find ways to boost productivity and make our work easier. One of the most common tasks for software developers and system administrators is working with SSH clients like Putty. However, copying and pasting text in Putty can be time-consuming and frustrating, leading to wasted hours and decreased productivity.

## The Problem

Copying and pasting text in Putty can be a hassle, requiring numerous steps and often resulting in errors or lost text. Standard keyboard shortcuts like CTRL-C and CTRL-V don't work as expected, forcing users to rely on convoluted methods like highlighting text with the mouse and pasting with right-click or using keyboard combinations like SHIFT+INSERT. This can lead to confusion, frustration, and ultimately slowed productivity.

## The Solution

The secret to effortlessly copying and pasting in Putty is using the "QuickEdit" feature, which enables a more intuitive method for copying and pasting text in the client.

To enable QuickEdit, simply right-click on the top bar of the Putty window, select "Properties", and navigate to the "Options" tab. Here, select the checkbox next to "QuickEdit Mode" and click "OK" to save the changes.

Once enabled, QuickEdit allows users to easily highlight text in the Putty window with the mouse, and then copy it to the clipboard by simply pressing the right mouse button. To paste text, users can simply right-click again to paste the copied text.

With QuickEdit enabled, there's no need to rely on convoluted methods or memorize keyboard combinations. Instead, you can effortlessly copy and paste text in Putty, streamlining your workflow and increasing productivity.

## Additional Tips

To further enhance your productivity, there are a few additional tips to keep in mind when working with Putty. Here are a few recommendations:
