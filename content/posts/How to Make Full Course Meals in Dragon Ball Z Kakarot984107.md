Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is an action-packed anime game that revolves around the adventures of the iconic Goku and his friends. The game is not only about battling powerful villains but also revolves around cooking full-course feasts in a variety of recipes. The game is all about exploring and mastering the art of cooking, which is a vital element of the game.

If you are an anime fan, then you must have seen how Goku loves to feast, and the game enables you to indulge in the same. The art of cooking is a critical part of the game, and it can have a significant impact on your overall gameplay experience. In this article, we'll guide you through the secrets to crafting delicious full-course meals in Dragon Ball Z Kakarot.

Understand the Cooking Mechanics

Cooking in Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is straightforward. All you need to do is gather ingredients, find a cooking location, and start cooking. However, there are specific mechanics to cooking in the game that are intrinsic to maximizing the effectiveness of your full-course meals.

Each ingredient has a specific category, such as Mushrooms or Fruits, and depending on the category, these ingredients will give bonuses such as Attack Boost or Defense Boost. The star rating of the ingredient determines the strength of the bonus, and you can even use the same ingredient multiple times to stack additional bonuses.

The cooking location also counts, and Dragon Ball Z Kakarot has various locations to cook food. Each location has a unique dish, and you can only craft that dish at the specific location. So, be sure to find locations such as Fatman's Soul and Uptown Pork City to craft unique dishes.

Invest in Your Cooking Skills

To master the art of cooking in Dragon Ball Z Kakarot, you need to invest in your cooking skills. You can level up your cooking skills by cooking more dishes, and you'll naturally progress through the ranks. As you level up, you'll unlock new recipes, cooking locations, and the ability to cook multiple dishes at once.

Additionally, certain characters such as Chi-Chi, who is Goku's wife, can teach you new recipes, but you'll need to complete specific side quests to unlock her abilities. Completing side quests will also give you rewards such as rare ingredients, so consider adding this to your to-do list.

Crafting the Perfect Full-Course Meal

Once you've gathered enough ingredients and leveled up your cooking skills, it's time to craft the perfect full-course meal. A full-course meal consists of six dishes, and you need to plan your dishes to maximize their benefits.

The first dish should be an appetizer, followed by a soup, a fish dish, a meat dish, a vegetable dish, and finally, a dessert. Each dish should be chosen based on its specific benefits, such as health regeneration or attack boosts, and make sure that you are using ingredients with high star ratings to maximize the benefits.

Conclusion

Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is not only about battling powerful villains, but it's also about mastering the culinary arts. With the right effort, you can unleash your inner Goku and create delicious full-course feasts that will give you powerful bonuses in battle. Mastering the art of cooking in the game is not only rewarding, but it's also a lot of fun! So get your apron on and start cooking!
