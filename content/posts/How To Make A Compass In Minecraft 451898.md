The compass in Minecraft is a useful item that helps in giving you the right directions whenever you want to go somewhere. In this article, we will show you how to make and use one to navigate.
 
## How to Craft a Compass in Minecraft?
 
Check out how you can make a compass in Minecraft with the steps below:
 
### Materials Required
 
Here are the materials needed to make a compass in Minecraft
 
- 7 x Iron ore
 - 1 x Redstone
 - Furnace
 - Crafting Table
 - To get Iron and Coal, all you need to do is look around in caves and cliffsides.
 - After you find the coal, you can begin mining for iron.
 - After you get the required 7 pieces of iron, you will need to smelt them to get ingots.
 - You will have to use the furnace to smelt the iron. Place the iron in the upper slot, then place the fuel of your choice in the lower slot.

 

 
- This process will give you iron ingots.
 - Now, you will need to find Redstone.
 - Redstone can be found at Y levels lower than iron and coal, between the bedrock and Y-level 16.

 
- Finding Redstone is easy as it is common in Minecraft.

 
### How to Make a Compass in Minecraft
 
Once you have all your required materials, open up your Crafting Table.
 
- Place the iron ingots in the following order:

 
- In the uppermost row, place an ingot in the second slot.
 - Place an ingot each in the first and third slot. In the second slot, place Redstone.
 - Repeat the placement order for the uppermost row for the lowest row as well.

 
This is how you make a compass in Minecraft.
 
### How to Use a Compass?
 
- Once you have crafted the compass in Minecraft, you can begin using it immediately.
 - To do so, place the compass in your hotbar.
 - As soon as you add the compass to your hotbar, you will notice that the compass’ red arrow will point towards the direction of the world spawn point.
 - Now, turn around so that the arrow points upwards. Keep walking in the same direction.
 - You will find the surroundings familiar because the compass will lead you back to the world spawn point.
 - And that’s how you use a compass in Minecraft.

 
This brings us to the end of this article on how to make and use a compass in Minecraft. As you can see, this is a very important item in the game and it is not very difficult to craft.
