Boost Your Website's Security and Performance Today: Learn How to Use Cloudflare Like a Pro!

As more businesses move their operations online, website security and performance become increasingly important. Your website is the face of your business on the internet, and it's crucial to keep it safe from hackers and malware while ensuring that it loads quickly and reliably.

Fortunately, Cloudflare can help you with both. In this article, we'll show you how to use Cloudflare to enhance your website's security and performance like a pro.

What is Cloudflare?

Cloudflare is a content delivery network (CDN) that provides security and performance services to websites around the world. It acts as a proxy between your website and your users, making your website faster and more secure.

Here are some of the benefits of using Cloudflare:

1. Increased website speed
Cloudflare caches static content on its servers, reducing the amount of time it takes for your website to load. This means that when a user requests your website, Cloudflare will serve the content from its cache, rather than making a request to your server, resulting in faster page load times.

2. Improved website uptime
If your website goes down, Cloudflare can keep your site up and running by serving cached versions of your pages until your server is back online.

3. Protection against DDoS attacks
Cloudflare protects your website against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks by filtering incoming traffic and blocking malicious requests.

4. SSL/TLS encryption
Cloudflare provides free SSL/TLS certificates that encrypt the connection between your website and your users, ensuring that data sent between the two is kept secure and private.

5. Firewall protection
Cloudflare's web application firewall provides an extra layer of protection against hackers and malware by blocking malicious requests and protecting your website's vulnerabilities.

Now that you know what Cloudflare is and its benefits let's dive into how to use it.

How to use Cloudflare

Step 1: Create a Cloudflare account
Start by creating a Cloudflare account. Sign up for free, then follow the setup wizard, which will guide you through the process of adding your website to Cloudflare.

Step 2: Change your DNS
Cloudflare will provide you with new DNS servers that you need to replace with your current ones. This process should take no longer than five minutes.

Step 3: Configure your settings
Once your DNS is configured, navigate to your website's Cloudflare dashboard and configure your settings. This includes enabling SSL/TLS encryption and choosing what level of caching and security is right for your website.

Step 4: Test and monitor
Test your website thoroughly to ensure that everything is working as it should. Monitor your website's performance and security using Cloudflare's analytics and security features, respectively. You can even integrate Cloudflare with Google Analytics to gain a better understanding of how your website is performing.

How fast is your website loading? 
 
Do you know that Google actually penalizes websites that are slow to load? If you want to get a good search engine ranking, one of the most important thing is to make sure your site load fast, blazingly fast!
 
If you are running WordPress, we have already mentioned several ways to polish up your site loading speed, including adding Google Analytics site speed tracking feature, lazy loading your images, using W3 Total Cache and minify the code. 
 
One other way is to use CloudFlare as a proxy server.

CloudFlare acts as a proxy server that link between you and your readers. When your readers enter your site’s URL, the browser will first connect to CloudFlare, which will then detect their locations and load your site content from the server closest to the readers. This will ensure your reader get the fastest loading time and performance. Furthermore, CloudFlare caches your script, css and image files, so there is no wastage of bandwidth and server resources.
 
In addition, as a proxy server, CloudFlare can detect who is accessing your site and block threats and limit abusive bots and crawlers before they reach you. In other words, CloudFlare is able to increase your site security as well.
 
## Configuring CloudFlare
 
Getting your site to run with CloudFlare is easy. 
 
1. Go to CloudFlare.com and sign up for an account.
 
2. Next, enter your site’s domain name. Click “Add this domain”.
 

 
3. CloudFlare will then scan your DNS. It might take up to 2 minutes. Once the scanning is completed, click “Continue to Step 2”.
 
4. The next page displays a list of your site existing DNS record. Check to see if they are correct. If necessary, you can add in extra DNS record here. If everything is correct, scroll down to the end and click “I’m done checking my DNS records, continue”
 
5. CloudFlare will then register your DNS setting and configure itself to power your site. CloudFlare will also add a sub-domain (of the name “direct”) for you to access your server without passing through the CloudFlare network.
 
6. The last step is to update your domain with the new DNS setting. If you register your domain name via a domain registrar, you can login to your domain registrar account and change the DNS setting. If you got everything set up via your web-host, submit a ticket and get them to change the DNS setting for you.
 
That’s it. You are good to go.

## What’s next after configuring CloudFlare?
 
After you have set up CloudFlare, login to your CloudFlare account and go to the “Settings -> CloudFlare Settings” (the link is beside your website). Here is where you can configure the settings for CloudFlare. Some of the important settings include Security level, Caching level, customize the Challenge page, E-mail Address Obfuscation, IP Geolocation (useful if you are showing geolocation ads) and Hotlink Protection. 
 
In addition, if you are using WordPress, install the CloudFlare plugin which can help you optimize your database and better protect your site from spammers.
