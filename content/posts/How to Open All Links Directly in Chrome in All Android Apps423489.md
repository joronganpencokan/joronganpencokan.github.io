# Revolutionize Your Android Experience: Open Every Link Instantly in Chrome with This Simple Hack!

Are you tired of waiting for links to open in your Android device? Do you want to enhance your browsing experience and save time? Then, you are in for a treat! In this article, we will show you how to open every link instantly on Chrome, using a simple hack.

First, let's understand the problem. When you click on a link in an app, such as Twitter or Facebook, it usually takes a few seconds to load in the app's built-in browser. Then, you have to wait further to open it in your preferred browser, such as Chrome or Firefox. This delay not only wastes your time but also interrupts your flow of reading or browsing. Furthermore, the built-in browser may not support all the features and extensions that you use in your favorite browser.

However, there is a solution to this problem, which we call the "open link in external browser" hack. This hack involves redirecting every link from the built-in browser to your default external browser, such as Chrome. This way, you can open links instantly and enjoy all the features of your preferred browser.

Here are the steps to enable the "open link in external browser" hack on your Android device:

1. Install an app that supports this hack, such as "Open Link With...". You can find this app on Google Play Store for free.
2. Launch the app and follow the instructions to set it as the default opener for every link.
3. Test the hack by clicking on a link in any app. It should automatically open in your external browser.

That's it! Now, you can enjoy lightning-fast link opening on your Android device. You can also customize the settings of the app to choose a different external browser for specific types of links or apps. Moreover, you can add exceptions for links that you want to open in the built-in browser for any reason.

The advantages of this hack are plenty. Firstly, you save time by avoiding the delay in loading links in the built-in browser. Secondly, you can use all the features, extensions, and settings of your preferred browser. For instance, you can use Chrome's autofill, passwords, and bookmarks across all your devices. Additionally, you can enjoy a seamless browsing experience without interruptions or compatibility issues.

In conclusion, the "open link in external browser" hack revolutionizes your Android experience by enhancing your browsing speed, convenience, and versatility. You can easily implement this hack using a free app and customize it to suit your preferences. Try it now and see the difference for yourself!

Every Android user has run into the WebView browser. They might not know what it is, but they’ve surely interacted with it. The WebView browser is a little basic stock in-app browser used by apps like Facebook, Twitter or any third-party app. When you open any link from Facebook, this is where it opens – not in Chrome but in a little secluded browser inside the app.
 
This browser is usually bare-bones, limited and slow, and it doesn’t carry any of your sign-in details for sites, cookies, history, bookmarks or anything like that. Not to mention that each in-app browser has a slightly different UI, and you have to go looking for that share or back button.
 
Google is trying to fix this problem by introducing a feature called Custom Chrome Tabs which lets apps integrate a real, fully functional Chrome tab as an in-app browser. It’s a great idea. The problem is behemoths like Facebook and Twitter are never going to adopt it because they want control over the in-app browser.
 
Well, what’s a geek to do? Take the matter into his/her own hands.
 
## Meet Chromer
 
Chromer is a slick little utility that replaces any app’s crummy built-in browser with Chrome Custom Tabs.
 
Now every time you tap a link from Facebook, it will open in a familia, and fast custom Chrome tab.
 

 
It’s that simple, and it’s just one of the wonders of Android that you can even do that just by downloading an app!
 
## How to Use Chrome Custom Tabs Everywhere
 
Once you’ve downloaded the app, it’s time to make it the default for opening links from apps.
 
From the app’s homescreen tap “Set default browser,” and from the menu that shows up select “Chromer” and then “Always.”
 
Below, you can also specify the secondary browser.
 
From the Personalization section you can change the color of the toolbar and the animations.
 
Chromer also has this really cool feature where it will automatically prefetch content in the background. Now if you have unlimited data and don’t care about background activity, turn this feature on. This feature will scan your screen for links and preload the data, so when you tap the page will be right there!
 
## Alternatives
 
If you don’t like in-app browsers, there are other alternatives for you as well.
 
Have you heard of pop-up browsers (like Flynx or Link Bubble)? These cool browsers work like Facebook’s Chat Heads. When you tap a link they open up in floating windows that you can minimize.
