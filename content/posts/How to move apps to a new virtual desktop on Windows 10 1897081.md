# Revolutionize Your Computer Setup with This Simple Trick to Move Apps to a New Virtual Desktop on Windows 10!

If you're like most people, you probably spend a lot of time on your computer each day. Whether you're working, browsing the web, or watching videos, having a cluttered desktop can make it difficult to stay organized and productive. Fortunately, Windows 10 offers a convenient solution: virtual desktops.

Virtual desktops are essentially a way to create multiple desktops on your computer. This means you can have different apps or windows open on each one, keeping your workspace clutter-free and organized. Here's how to revolutionize your computer setup with a simple trick to move apps to a new virtual desktop on Windows 10.

## Step One: Create a New Virtual Desktop

To create a new virtual desktop, simply click on the Task View button on your taskbar (it looks like a box with three lines). Once you do, you'll see all of your open windows in a tiled view. From here, you can either click the "New Desktop" button at the top of the screen or use the keyboard shortcut "Windows + Tab" and then click the "New Desktop" button.

## Step Two: Move Your App to the New Desktop

Now that you've created a new virtual desktop, the next step is to move your app or window to it. To do this, simply click on the app or window you want to move and drag it to the desktop thumbnail at the top of the screen. Alternatively, you can also right-click on the app or window and select "Move to" and then choose the virtual desktop you want to move it to.

## Step Three: Switch Between Virtual Desktops

Once you've moved your app or window to a new virtual desktop, you can switch between them easily. To do this, either click on the Task View button again and select the desktop you want to switch to, or use the keyboard shortcut "Windows + Ctrl + Left/Right Arrow" to move between virtual desktops quickly.

## Conclusion

By using virtual desktops in Windows 10, you can keep your workspace organized and clutter-free. With just a few clicks, you can create a new desktop, move your app or window to it, and switch between them easily. Whether you're working on a project, browsing the web, or watching videos, virtual desktops can help you stay productive and focused. Give it a try and revolutionize your computer setup today!

On Windows 10, Microsoft is introducing the concept of virtual desktops. This feature has been around in other operating systems for a long while, even Windows XP had the Virtual Desktop Manager PowerToy utility, but the software giant is now bringing the feature to its new operating system.
 
Microsoft calls the feature Virtual Desktop by opening the Task View with the button located on the Taskbar (or using the Windows + Tab keyboard shortcut). The feature allows users to create different “virtual desktops” to run different sets of applications on separate desktops to keep things organized and not too clutter.
 
In this Windows 10 guide, you’ll learn two ways in which you can move apps between virtual desktops.
 
## How to move apps between virtual desktops on Windows 10
 
To move an app to a new desktop, do the following:
 
- Click the Task View button on the taskbar. (You can also use Windows key + Tab keyboard shortcut.)
 - If you’re running a single desktop, click the (+) button at the bottom of the screen to create a new virtual desktop. Right-click the app you want move, select Move to, and select the desktop you want to move the app.
 - Note that you can also select New desktop, which will create a new virtual desktop for the app you want.
