On the other hand, if you are trying to solve a puzzle, you may want to choose a companion with high intelligence. It is important to pay close attention to the skills and abilities of each companion and choose the right one for each task. 

Equip the Right Gear:
The gear you equip on your companion can make a huge difference in their overall power. Just like in real life, the right gear can make all the difference. Make sure to equip your companion with gear that enhances their strengths, whether it be physical attack power or intelligence. There are many different pieces of gear to choose from, so take your time and choose wisely. 

Feed Your Companion:
Just like in real life, your companion needs to eat. Feeding your companion will restore their health and give them a boost of energy. Make sure to keep your companion well-fed so they have the strength to complete all of the quests and challenges in Disney Dreamlight Valley. 

Conclusion:
In conclusion, unlocking your companion's hidden power in Disney Dreamlight Valley is all about leveling up, choosing the right skills, equipping the right gear, and feeding your companion.

## How to Level Up Companions in Disney Dreamlight Valley
 

 
To level up a Companion you can follow these steps
 
- Go on a Quest
 - Gift your Companions with Favorite Items
 - Daily Conversation
 - Hanging Out

 
### 1. Go on a Quest
 
Every Companion has friendship quests. These Quests when completed give you XP. These XP levels up your Companion faster.
 
### 2. Gift your Companion with Favorite Items
 
Gifting Companion’s favorite items of the day is a great way to gain XP. You can Gift only 3 favorite items every day. Not only do favorite items increase the XP of your Companion, but also a few items such as flowers and gems increase your companion’s XP too. Especially, Flowers help a lot to gain XP, which is found easily.
 
### 3. Daily Conversation
 
This trick also helps in gaining XP. When you interact with your Companion you will notice a Sentence in the option. Click on the sentence to interact with your Companion. At the end of the conversation, you will notice an increased XP. Note that, you can have this conversation only once during the day. In comparison to other means of leveling up the companion, this method is slow.
 
### 4. Hanging Out
 
As soon as your Companion reaches level 2 you get to choose any one role for your Companion from Minning, Foraging, Fishing, or Digging. Once, the roles are assigned, they cannot be changed for the rest of the game. After selecting the role for your Companion, you can choose the ‘Hang Out’ option after interacting with them. Performing tasks while hanging out with the companion that is assigned to them, rewards you with an extra item after the end of the task.
