### Method 1: Sending Chat Message
 
One of the easiest methods to know if someone is online on Snapchat is to send a chat message to the contact you want to track. The detailed steps for this method are mentioned below:
 
1. Open Snapchat and tap on the “chats” icon on the bottom menu bar to gain access to the chat window of Snapchat. 
 
2. Select the contact you want to know about and tap on their chat. Type a message for your friend and hit the “Send” button.
 
3.  Now, you need to observe if your friend’s Bitmoji is shown on the bottom left corner of your screen or not. If you see a Bitmoji on your screen, this means the person is definitely Online.
 
In case, your friend does not use Bitmoji, you can observe a “smiley” icon that turns into a blue dot indicating that the person is online. And if you don’t observe any changes on the chat window, it means the person is offline.
 
### Method 2: Sharing a Snap
 
You can also get to know if someone is online on Snapchat or not, by sharing a snap. All you need to do is share a snap with your contacts and observe their name on the chat window. If the chat window status shifts from “Delivered” to “Opened“, it means the person is online on Snapchat. 
 
### Method 3: Check Snapchat Stories or Posts
 
Although, it is a very commonly used technique to know if someone is online on Snapchat. But new users face problems while checking the recent updates of their contacts on Snapchat. You need to check if they have recently shared a snap with you or not. Further, you must check their story updates to form an idea about when they were active on Snapchat. This trick lets you know whether your friend was recently online or not.

### Method 5: By Accessing Snap Map
 
You may come to know about your friend’s status by accessing the Snap Map on Snapchat. Snap Map is a feature of Snapchat that allows you to locate your friends.
