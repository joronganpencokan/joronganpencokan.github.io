Windows 11 has been out for a while now, and while many have been pleased with the new upgrade, some users have reported issues with the volume mixer. The volume mixer is an important tool that allows you to adjust the volume of different applications running on your computer. Unfortunately, on Windows 11, the volume mixer may not work as expected, leaving users frustrated and confused.

If you're one of the users experiencing difficulty adjusting the volume on your Windows 11 computer, don't worry. In this article, we'll show you two quick and simple methods to fix the issue and get your volume mixer working correctly again.

**Method 1: Restart the Audio Service**

This method is the simplest and quickest way to fix the volume mixer problem. It involves restarting your audio service, which is responsible for managing sound on your computer.

Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Press the Windows key + R on your keyboard to open the Run dialogue box.

Step 2: Type in "services.msc" and hit Enter.

Step 3: Locate the Windows Audio service and right-click on it.

Step 4: Choose "Restart" from the context menu.

Step 5: Wait a few seconds for the audio service to restart, then check to see if the volume mixer is working correctly.

If the volume mixer is still not working properly, move on to the next method.

**Method 2: Update Audio Drivers**

If restarting the audio service doesn't solve the problem, it's possible that your audio drivers need to be updated. Outdated audio drivers can often cause issues with the volume mixer and other audio-related problems.

Here's how to update your audio drivers:

Step 1: Click on the Windows Start menu, then click on "Settings."

Step 2: Click on "System" and then "Sound."

Step 3: Under "Output," click on "Device properties."

Step 4: Click on the "Driver" tab, then click on "Update Driver."

Step 5: Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the driver update process.

Once the drivers are updated, check to see if the volume mixer is working properly.

In conclusion, these two methods should help you fix the volume mixer issues on your Windows 11 computer. If both methods fail, you can also try running the Windows Audio Troubleshooter or performing a system restore to a previous point. But in most cases, restarting the audio service and updating audio drivers should do the job. So, get started with the methods mentioned above and get your volume mixer working like a charm!
