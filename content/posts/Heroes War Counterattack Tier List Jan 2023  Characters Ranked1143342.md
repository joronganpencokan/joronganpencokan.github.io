# Unleash Epic Power with the Ultimate Heroes War Counterattack Tier List Jan 2023 - Which Characters Will Reign Supreme?

If you are a fan of the Heroes War game, you know that winning battles and defeating your opponents requires the ultimate heroes with the best skills and abilities. As time passes, new characters are introduced, and each one is designed to surpass the others. That's why it's essential to keep up with the game's updates and know which characters are the strongest and will bring you closer to victory. 

The Heroes War Counterattack Tier List Jan 2023 is here to help you pick the ultimate heroes to lead you to glory. Let's take a closer look at which characters can reign supreme in the game's current version.

## Tier S

Tier S is for the ultimate characters with fantastic abilities and special powers that make them crucial in winning every battle. 

1. Kaya - This girl is simply formidable with her numerous buffs, which make her a capable healer while boosting her teammates' attack power. Combined with her powerful resurrection ability, many consider Kaya to be the best hero in the game. 

2. Jarra - She is one of the most popular heroes in the game and for a good reason. With her skill that allows her to steal her enemies' buffs and use them against them, Jarra is a powerful all-around character who can deal a significant amount of damage while keeping her allies well-protected.

3. Naressa - With a unique ability that lets her block enemy skills, Naressa is a valuable ally to have in any battle. She also has a powerful bleed effect, which further improves her damage output.

## Tier A

Tier A includes heroes with great skills and abilities that can turn the tide of the battle in your favour. 

1. Garff - This dwarf is an excellent defender with high defence and health stats, making him a tank that can withstand significant amounts of damage. He also has a stun effect, making him an excellent crowd controller in the battlefield.

2. Valentina - With a range of abilities that boost her allies' attack power and speed while debuffing her opponents, Valentina is a must-have character for any team.

3. Thalos - This robot is a valuable asset that can deal a significant amount of damage while being able to protect and heal his allies. He also has a charge skill that can knock down multiple enemies at once.

## Tier B

Tier B heroes are still a great choice but are slightly weaker than the top tiers. 

1. Ravencroft - With his passive abilities that allow him to heal and resurrect his allies, Ravencroft is an effective support hero that can turn the tables on his enemies.

2. Saya - A magical girl with plenty of damage capabilities, Saya excels at dealing heavy damage to a single target while boosting her own attack power.

3. Bovus - As a beast with high health and attack stats, Bovus can deal decent damage while also buffing his allies' attack power.

## Tier C

Tier C heroes are still good in their own right, but they are not as valuable to have on your team compared to the higher tiers. 

1. Reyla - Despite her decent skills and abilities, Reyla is too situational, meaning she's only effective in specific battles.

2. Rok - This orc is a decent hero that can deal significant damage but lacks useful skills that can contribute to his team's victory.

3. Aria - This healer is a decent support character, but her skills are just not as powerful compared to her counterparts in the higher tiers. 

## Conclusion

The Heroes War Counterattack Tier List Jan 2023 gives an overview of the game's most powerful heroes and their unique abilities. Keep in mind that each character has their strengths and weaknesses, and your team's composition should be chosen based on the battle at hand.
