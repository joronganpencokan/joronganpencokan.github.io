When Guitar Hero World Tour, the fourth music video game in the Guitar Hero series, was released in late 2008, it wasn’t quite like its predecessors. While this version focused on mimicking its included musical tracks using special game controllers, it also included drums and vocals, as well as a music studio to create your own songs.

 

The Guitar Hero World Tour song list consists of 86 tunes from artists and bands including Blink-182, Bon Jovi, Beastie Boys, Nirvana, Metallica, Michael Jackson, Rise Against, and many others. When the game was first released, players could also purchase and download additional tracks, but that downloadable content is no longer available.
