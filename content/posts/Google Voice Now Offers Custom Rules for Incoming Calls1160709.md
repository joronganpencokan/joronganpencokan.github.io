# Revolutionize Your Phone Calls Forever: Google Voice Unveils Life Changing Custom Rules!

Have you ever been in a situation where you missed an important call, or received one at an inconvenient time? Or perhaps you've been frustrated with telemarketers and spam calls interrupting your day? These common frustrations are now a thing of the past, as Google Voice has unveiled their life changing Custom Rules!

Google Voice is a telecommunications service created by Google. It provides call forwarding and voicemail services, as well as other features such as text messaging and call screening. With Custom Rules, Google Voice is taking phone calling to a whole new level.

Custom Rules allows users to create unique rules for incoming calls based on their specific needs. You can now create customized schedules for when you want to receive calls, as well as setting rules for how a call should be handled based on the caller's information.

For example, you can set up rules to automatically send certain callers directly to voicemail outside of certain hours. Likewise, if you're expecting an important call from a certain contact, you can set up a rule to ensure that call always comes through, even if you are in "Do Not Disturb" mode.

Further, you can now block unwanted callers and telemarketers at the source, before they can ever reach your phone. Using Custom Rules, unknown or suspicious numbers can be set to automatically go straight to voicemail or be disconnected altogether. This feature not only saves time but also provides peace of mind.

Even for those who use Google Voice for personal calls, Custom Rules is a game-changer. It allows users to customize how calls are handled based on their personal preferences, making the experience more streamlined and personalized. Additionally, different rules can be set for different groups of callers, such as friends and family, work contacts, or even specific individuals.

In summary, Custom Rules by Google Voice is the revolution we've all been waiting for. It has the potential to level up our communication experience, putting an end to missed calls, unwanted telemarketing, and call interruptions once and for all. With Custom Rules, you can completely customize the way calls are handled on your phone. The result? A completely unique and personalized calling experience that fits your specific needs.

Google Voice is making custom rules available for incoming calls, allowing users to decide how to handle groups or even specific individual contacts.

 

New tools are available for Google Voice users that allow for more direct control over how incoming calls from contacts are received. Google's aim is to help provide a better workflow and help with productivity by reducing possible distractions. Essentially you'll be able to redirect calls from non-essential contacts while still letting through calls that are more likely to be important.

 

If you use Google Voice, you now have several new options for dealing with calls from your contacts. You can set it up to forward specific contact calls to voicemail or to a different linked phone number.

 

You can also set up custom voicemails for individual contacts. And you can screen calls from individual contacts, too. Or you can apply the rules you've created to all contacts or designated groups within your contacts.

 

All of this can be managed in the Calls menu in Google Voice, where you'll find two new buttons under Call Forwarding: Create a rule and Manage rules. From there, you can adjust settings for individual contacts or groups, assign specific voicemails or forwarding numbers, etc.

 

The new custom rules feature is live now for all Google Voice users. It's Off by default, but you can activate it in Google Voice settings.
