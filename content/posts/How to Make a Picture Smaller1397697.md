Shocking trick to reduce photo size without losing quality - you won't believe how easy it is!

Are you tired of dealing with large photo files that take forever to upload or email? Do you wish there was a way to reduce their size without losing the quality of the image? Well, look no further! We've found a shocking trick that will change the way you think about photo compression.

Normally, when you try to reduce the size of a photo, the quality of the image tends to suffer. However, with this trick, you can reduce the size of your photo by up to 70% without losing any of its quality.

The trick is to use a process called "lossless compression". This process compresses the photo file size in a way that doesn't discard any information, meaning that when you or someone else opens the photo, it looks exactly the same.

So, how do you go about using lossless compression? The easiest way is to use a free online tool called "TinyPNG". Simply upload the photo you want to compress to the website and it will automatically compress the file using lossless compression techniques.

The great thing about TinyPNG is that it not only reduces the file size of your photos, but it also maintains the quality of the image. This means that you can upload your compressed photos to your website or social media platforms, and they'll look just as good as the original.

Another way to use lossless compression is to use photo editing software like Photoshop or Lightroom. With these tools, you can compress your photos using the "Save for Web" feature. This feature is specifically designed to maintain the quality of your image while reducing its file size.

In conclusion, the trick to reducing photo size without losing quality is to use lossless compression. This process maintains the quality of your image while significantly reducing its file size. Try using tools like TinyPNG or photo editing software like Photoshop to compress your photos and make them easier to share and upload. Trust us, you won't believe how easy it really is!

A smaller image is faster to share and faster for folks to download (or just see on Facebook, Instagram, or just download via email). If the image(s) is part of a presentation, a smaller image can make the whole presentation smaller and easier for more computers to handle

 
##   Resizing is About More Than Just Stretching and Shrinking  
 

When working with images on your computer, you'll sometimes see selectable arrows on the sides and/or corners of the image. You could simply move the arrows as needed to make it just the right size. This is not the best way to resize images, however, since it stretches (or compresses) the image, making it look blurry, out of focus, and pixelated. 

 

A better way to resize your image is to use image-editing software, where you can control the image quality better, making the resized image look polished and professional. 

 
###   It Starts With an Image File  
 

The quality of your resized image depends on the original image you're working with. Image files (PNG, JPG, TIF, etc.) are the best type of images to resize as they tend to have more detail. More detail means higher resolution, which makes it easier for the software to resize the image without losing any of that detail. 

 
###   Keep the Image in Perspective  
 

When you resize an image, try to keep the same ratio of width to height. This will prevent your image from looking stretched or warped as you resize it. Most image editors let you do this with a "constrain proportions" option that automatically does this for you as you resize the image. The Shift key is a shortcut way to do this in most image editing software. 

 
##   How to Resize an Image  
 

Resizing an image is easy to do. You can do it with an online image resizer such as Pixlr or Simple Image Resizer, or you can use image-editing software (either on your computer or your mobile device).
