# Never Worry About Home Security Again: Learn How To Lock Your Home From Anywhere Using Just Your Smartphone!

Are you worried about the security of your home when you're out? Do you constantly check and double-check to make sure all the doors and windows are locked before you leave the house? There's no need to worry anymore as technology has made it possible to control the locks of your home from anywhere using just your smartphone. 

With the increasing popularity of smart home technology, home security systems have become more advanced and more accessible. One such advancement is the ability to control locks remotely using a smartphone app. This technology offers numerous benefits that can ease all your worries about home security.

## How Does It Work?

Modern smart locks come with Wi-Fi enabled connectivity that allows them to connect to your home network. Once connected, you can control your smart lock through a smartphone app. You can lock and unlock the door remotely and even check if the door is locked or unlocked.

Some smart locks come with keyless features that allow you to enter the house using a digital code or a fingerprint scanner in place of a traditional key. This provides improved security, as there is no chance of misplacing or losing your key, and you don't need to worry about people copying your key or gaining unauthorized access.

## Benefits of Using Smart Locks

1. Convenience - No need to carry keys around when you're out as you can enter your home using the app on your smartphone. 

2. Enhanced Security - With the ability to lock and unlock your doors remotely, you can monitor your home's security regardless of where you are. If you notice that a door has been left unlocked, you can quickly lock it using the app to prevent unauthorized access.

3. Control Access - You can grant or revoke access to your home without having to worry about changing physical locks. If you need to let in a friend or repairman, you can give them access for a specific period and then revoke it when they leave.

4. Cost-effective - Although smart locks are initially expensive, they are a more cost-effective alternative in the long run. Unlike traditional locks, you do not need to hire a professional locksmith to change the locks each time a key is lost, and you'll never have to worry about making copies or getting locked out.

## Choosing the Right Smart Lock

When selecting a smart lock, it is essential to consider the features you need. Some smart locks come with keyless entry, while others require a traditional key for backup. Additionally, some locks come with Wi-Fi connectivity, while others require a separate gateway device to connect to your home network.

Another vital aspect to consider is compatibility with your current door hardware. Most smart locks offer easy installation and are compatible with standard door locks, but some require more complicated installation processes. Make sure to check the manufacturer's recommendations before making a purchase.

## Conclusion

Smart locks are a game-changer, making it easier to keep your home secure and giving you peace of mind, no matter where you are. With the ability to control your door lock remotely through your smartphone, you have the ability to stay connected with your home and never have to worry about losing your keys again. Take the time to research the different options available and select the one that best suits your needs.

This article explains how to lock your home up using a smartphone and Z-Wave smart locks. All you need is an internet connection and an Android or iOS phone.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Set up Z-Wave controller: Connect to compatible deadbolt devices > connect to internet > download controller apps.Check controller and device compatibility before purchasing. Set lights to turn on when deadbolt is unlocked.Check device security implementations with manufacturer to combat hacking.

 
##   Choose a Z-Wave Controller  
 

Z-Wave is the marketing name given to the mesh network-enabling technology used for smart home control. There are other home control standards, such as X10, Zigbee, and others, but we're going to focus on Z-Wave for this article.

 

To set up remote-controlled deadbolts such as the one seen in the picture above, you first need a Z-wave-capable controller. This is the brains behind the operation. The controller creates a secure wireless mesh network that's used to communicate with Z-Wave-enabled appliances.

 

Each Z-Wave appliance, such as a wireless door lock or light switch dimmer, acts as a network repeater which helps to extend the range of the network and provide communications redundancy for other devices and appliances connected to the network.

 
##   Select Your Z-Wave-Enabled Appliances  
 

There are a ton of remote-controllable Z-Wave-enabled appliances out on the market, including:

 
Many Z-Wave home control solutions are offered by home alarm service providers such as Alarm.com as an add-on service. They rely on the Z-Wave network created by the alarm system controller, such as the 2GiG Technologies Go!Control Wireless Alarm System, which has a built-in Z-Wave controller.
 
- Electronic Deadbolt Locks
 - Light Fixture Dimmers and Switches
 - HVAC Thermostat Controllers
 - Motion Sensors
 - Flood Sensors
 - Smoke Detectors
 - Remote-Controlled Outlets and Power Strips

 
##   Connect Your Controller to the Internet  
 

Once you have the Z-Wave controller set up and you connect your Z-Wave appliances per the manufacturer's instructions, you need to establish a connection to your Z-Wave controller from the internet.

 

If you're using Alarm.com or another service provider, you need to pay for a package that allows for control over your Z-Wave appliances.

 
##   Download Controller Apps  
 

Once you have a service provider or have set up your connection to your controller, then you need to download the specific Z-Wave control app for your controller. Alarm.com has Android and iPhone versions of its app, as well.

 
##   Lock Your Home With Z-Wave Deadbolts  
 

Major Z-Wave-enabled deadbolts on the market include Kwikset's deadbolt line and Schlage's line. Your controller might only be compatible with a certain brand of electronic deadbolt, so make sure you check its website for compatibility information.

 

Some neat features of these Z-Wave deadbolts are that they can determine whether they're locked or not and can relay that information to you on your smartphone, so you won't have to worry about whether you locked them or not. Some models also let you engage or disengage your security system via the lock's keypad.

 

If you want to get really creative, program your interior Z-Wave-enabled lights to come on as the deadbolt lock is disengaged from the keypad.

 
##   Any Downsides?  
 

The main potential downside of this internet/smartphone-connected smart home technology is the potential for hackers and bad guys to mess with it. It's one thing if a hacker does something bad to your computer, but when they start messing with your thermostat, door locks, and lights, then they might negatively affect your personal safety in a tangible way.

 

Before you purchase a Z-Wave device, check with its manufacturer to see how they implement security.
