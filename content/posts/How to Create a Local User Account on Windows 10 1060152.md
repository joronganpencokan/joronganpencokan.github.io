Secret Hack Revealed: Learn How To Create a Local User Account on Windows 10 Like a Pro!

If you're a Windows 10 user, you may have noticed that Microsoft has made it increasingly difficult to create local user accounts. Instead, they have been pushing users towards creating a Microsoft account or logging in with a Microsoft account.

However, there may be reasons that you want to create local user accounts on your Windows 10 device. You may not want to link your Microsoft account to your computer, or maybe you want to create a separate account for a family member to use. Whatever the reason, we've got you covered with this secret hack on how to create a local user account on Windows 10 like a pro.

First, you'll need to open up the Command Prompt with administrative privileges. You can do this by right-clicking on the Start Menu and selecting "Command Prompt (Admin)." Alternatively, you can press the Windows key + X and select "Command Prompt (Admin)" from the list.

Once you have the Command Prompt open, type in the following command, replacing "username" with the name you want to give your new user account:

net user username /add

After you hit enter, you'll see a prompt asking you to create a password for the new user account. You can either create a password or leave it blank if you prefer to have a password-free account.

Now that you've created the local user account, you'll need to add it to the Administrators group so that it has the necessary permissions to perform tasks on your computer. Type the following command into the Command Prompt, replacing "username" with the name of the account you just created:

net localgroup administrators username /add

Congratulations, you've successfully created a local user account on your Windows 10 device like a pro! Now you can use this account to log in to your computer without linking it to a Microsoft account.

It's important to note that if you want to delete this local user account in the future, you can use the following command:

net user username /delete

In conclusion, creating a local user account on Windows 10 isn't as difficult as it may seem. With this secret hack, you can create a local user account like a pro and enjoy the benefits of having a separate account for your family members or someone else. Just remember to always exercise caution when making changes to your computer and only create accounts for people you trust.
