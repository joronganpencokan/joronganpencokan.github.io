Revolutionary New Clothing Tech Takes Virtual Reality to Mind-Bending Levels!

When most people think of virtual reality, they think of headsets and controllers that allow you to visually immerse yourself in a computer-generated world. But imagine if you could feel like you were really there, with every sensation of the virtual world transmitted to your skin in real-time. That's exactly what a team of scientists and engineers have accomplished with the introduction of revolutionary new clothing tech that takes virtual reality to mind-bending levels.

At the heart of this technology is a suit filled with tiny, lightweight sensors that can detect a wide range of stimuli, from pressure and temperature to motion and orientation. The sensors are so precise that they can pick up even the subtlest movements of your body, allowing you to interact with the virtual world in an unprecedented way.

But it's not just a one-way street. The suit is also equipped with a variety of actuators that can send tactile feedback to your skin in response to what you're experiencing in the virtual world. So if you're walking on a sandy beach, for example, you'll feel the grains of sand underfoot. If you're flying through space, you'll feel the sense of weightlessness and the rush of air against your skin. In short, you'll feel like you're really there.

The possibilities of this tech are mind-boggling. Imagine exploring a virtual Paris with all the sights and sounds, but with the added sensation of actually feeling the cobblestone streets under your feet and the wind in your hair. Imagine practicing dangerous surgeries in a virtual operating room and actually feeling the resistance of the human tissue as you cut through it. Imagine playing a high-stakes game of virtual chess with your opponent and being able to feel the weight of the pieces in your hand.

Of course, this technology is still in its early stages and there's much work to be done before it's ready for mainstream use. For one thing, there's the question of how to power all those sensors and actuators without making the suit uncomfortably heavy or hot. There's also the challenge of developing software that can effectively translate the virtual world into real-world tactile feedback, and vice versa.

But despite the challenges, the potential rewards of this technology are enormous. If this suit could one day become commonplace, it could revolutionize the way we experience entertainment, education, and even medicine. It's an exciting time to be alive, and the future promises to be more mind-bending than we could have ever imagined.

Virtual reality (VR) isn’t just about what you see.

Key Takeaways
 
- You can now buy boots for use in VR that could make walking in VR more realistic.The in-development Omni One treadmill allows users to walk and run in place while in VR.Future VR products might even include spraying scents into your face.

 

Ekto VR has revealed a pair of boots intended to make VR worlds feel much more immersive and less nauseating to walk around. It’s one of a growing number of gadgets designed to make VR feel more realistic as the technology advances. 

 

“VR is inherently spatialized and embodied, but at the current moment in its evolution, it is primarily only engaging the visual and auditory senses, which limits the depth of immersion for the user,” Amir Bozorgzadeh, CEO of VR company Virtuleap, told Lifewire in an email interview.

 
##   Boot Up  
 

Ekto’s current boots are likely out of the price range of casual VR users as they cost $15,000. They’re intended for corporate training environments, but the company plans to release more consumer-friendly versions. 

 

In the meantime, there is a range of other products designed to enhance the realism of virtual reality. For example, the 3DRudder footpad allows you to control movement in VR by leaning and tilting your feet. 

 

If you want to go full-body, though, consider a suit that allows you to feel what's happening in VR, like the ElecSuit. Currently an IndieGoGo project, it's meant for electrical stimulation and VR gaming; the company behind it claims the suit stimulates your muscles by sending electrical signals directly to your body.

 

"Exercises are trickier than we think sometimes," the company writes on its website. "With ElecSuit, electrical signals will cue which muscles you should work on for each exercise. With the chair pose in yoga, for example, it's easy to overlook that you have to work your core too."

 

If being shocked while doing yoga doesn’t sound fun, you might consider gloves like the recently announced TactGlove, a pair of $299 haptic gloves for the consumer market. The gloves have motors placed at each fingertip and are individually controllable using special software, allowing content developers to program precise feedback.

For a full-body experience, there’s the in-development Omni One treadmill that allows users to walk and run in place while in a VR space. Similar VR treadmills already exist and can cost tens of thousands of dollars, but the makers of the Omni One claim it will be priced at less than $2,000.

 
##   Feedback Loops  
 

Going forward, developers say more input devices are needed to get the most out of VR.

 

"We're honestly at such an early stage with the development in this area, so the future is quite broad from my perspective," Luke Thompson, Chief Operating Officer of the visual effects company ActionVFX, which is transitioning its products to be compatible with VR software, told Lifewire in an email interview.

 

Future VR products might even include spraying scents into your face. The FEELREAL Multisensory VR Mask, for example, uses different smells when playing VR games to enhance the realism. The company producing the mask states the product releases each scent in small amounts via triggers planted throughout games and movies. 

 

"Pull the trigger, and you'll smell gunpowder; pick up the mug, and you'll feel the aroma of freshly brewed coffee," according to the company's website. "Liquids are vapored in small quantities under the user's nose, and it makes [the] Feelreal Mask a perfect gadget for individual use. Wearing it, you won't be bothering anyone with your entertainment routine."

 

Bozorgzadeh is optimistic that with devices like smell masks, VR will soon be a lot more than just a headset.

 

"Add-ons that incorporate the other senses, like scent and haptics (touch), will inevitably increase the number of senses that a particular 3D environment can engage and, so, become an ever more compelling reality that our whole bodies believe is as authentic as the real one," he said.
