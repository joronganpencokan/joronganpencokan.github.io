# Discover The Secret Trick To Quickly Label Your Inventory As Junk In Mass Effect Legendary Edition!

Are you struggling to manage your inventory in Mass Effect Legendary Edition? Are you tired of scrolling through countless items to find the ones you want to sell or dismantle? Well, we have some good news for you! There's a secret trick to quickly label your inventory as junk, and we're going to share it with you.

First things first, let's clarify what we mean by labeling your inventory as junk. In Mass Effect Legendary Edition, you have the ability to mark items in your inventory as junk. This is a way to quickly sell or dismantle items that you don't need without having to go through each item individually.

So, how do you label items as junk? It's actually quite simple. When you're in your inventory screen, hover over an item that you want to label as junk. Press and hold the 'X' button (for Xbox) or 'Square' button (for PlayStation) until the item is labeled as junk. You should see a small symbol next to the item that confirms it's been labeled.

But what if you want to label multiple items as junk at once? That's where the secret trick comes in. Hold down the 'Y' button (for Xbox) or 'Triangle' button (for PlayStation) while hovering over an item. This will label the item as junk and automatically move your cursor to the next item in your inventory. Simply continue holding down the button and hovering over the items you want to label.

This trick is especially useful when you have a lot of items to label as junk. It saves you time and makes the process much more efficient. Plus, you won't accidentally miss any items that you want to get rid of.

Once you've labeled all of your unwanted items as junk, go to a vendor or the nearest workbench and select the 'Sell Junk' or 'Dismantle Junk' option. This will automatically sell or dismantle all of your junk items, freeing up space in your inventory and putting some extra credits in your wallet.

In conclusion, labeling your inventory as junk is a handy feature in Mass Effect Legendary Edition that can save you time and make managing your inventory much easier. And with the secret trick of holding down the 'Y' or 'Triangle' button, labeling multiple items as junk is a breeze. So, what are you waiting for? Give it a try and enjoy a streamlined inventory experience!
