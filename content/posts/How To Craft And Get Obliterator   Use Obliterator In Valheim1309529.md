# Unleash Destruction Like Never Before in Valheim - Discover the Secret to Crafting the Mighty Obliterator!

## Introduction

Valheim has captured the hearts of many gamers since its release on February 2, 2021. It is a survival game that requires players to explore the world, gather resources, build shelter, and battle supernatural beasts. In Valheim, crafting weapons and tools is a key part of survival, but have you ever heard of the Mighty Obliterator? It is a weapon that can unleash destruction like never before, and in this article, we will show you how to craft it.

## How to Get the Mighty Obliterator

Before jumping into the crafting process, it is essential to know the ingredients required for the Mighty Obliterator. There are three ingredients, and each one is challenging to obtain.

### Dragon Tear

The Dragon Tear is a rare loot drop from the final boss of Valheim, Moder, the Dragon Queen. To summon Moder, players need to assemble three dragon eggs, which are scattered around the world. Once Moder is defeated, there is a chance that she will drop the Dragon Tear.

### Ymir Flesh

Ymir Flesh is a material that is obtained from the corpse of Ymir, a giant creature found in the Plains biome. To reach the Plains biome, players must have defeated Moder and obtained the Fuling Totems, which are keys to the Plains biome. Ymir can be found in the heart of the Plains biome, and he is very tough to defeat.

### Ancient Bark

Ancient Bark is an uncommon resource that can be obtained from Ancient Trees in the Swamp biome. To get to the Swamp biome, players must defeat the third boss, Bonemass. Ancient Trees are scattered around the Swamp biome, and they glow white and emit a loud sound when approached.

## Crafting the Mighty Obliterator

Once the three ingredients are obtained, it is time to craft the Mighty Obliterator. To craft it, players must access the forge and have the following resources:

- 5 Draugr Fangs
- 10 Silver
- 5 Ancient Bark
- 5 Ymir Flesh
- 1 Dragon Tear

Once all the resources are gathered, place them into the forge to craft the Mighty Obliterator. 

## Conclusion

The Mighty Obliterator is a weapon that can unleash destruction like never before in Valheim. It requires three rare ingredients, which are obtained by defeating the final boss, Moder, and Ymir, a giant creature in the Plains biome, and by harvesting Ancient Trees in the Swamp biome. Crafting the Mighty Obliterator requires the use of a forge and other resources such as Draugr Fangs, Silver, and Ancient Bark. It is a weapon that is worth crafting as it can make defeating some of the toughest creatures in Valheim more manageable. Happy crafting!

Valheim Hearth and Home update adds a lot of new items and features to the game. And among these many additions, you will also find the Obliterator. Obliterator as the name suggests can be used to obliterate any item you don’t need. So without further ado, let’s check how to craft and get Obliterator in Valheim and how to use it.
 
## How to Craft and Get Obliterator in Valheim
 

 
To craft the Obliterator you will need the following items:
 
- 1 Thunder Stone
 - 4 Copper Ingots
 - 8 Iron Ingots

 
For starters, you will need a Thunder Stone, which you can obtain from the Trader for 50 gold coins. Once you get the stone you will automatically get the recipe for making the Obliterator. As for the trader, there is no fixed location where he can be found, but you can always find him in the Black Forest Biome.
 
Next, for the Copper Ingots, you can find these in the Black forest as well. And lastly, the Iron Ingots can be fetched and gathered from the crypts in the Swamp Biome. Remember that you need to be in the range of the Forge to craft the Obliterator. Once you have the above items and are in the range of the forge you will find Obliterator in the Crafting section of the menu. Craft it to get the Obliterator.
 
### How to Use Obliterator
 
Using the Obliterator is quite easy and you can do that by following these steps:
 
- Set the Obliterator
 - Interact with it and deposit the unnecessary items in the given slots
 - Pull the lever and move away from it.

 
Moving away is important as doing that will help you to avoid taking damage from lightning. Once the Obliterator destroys the items, you will find coal in its place which can be removed and used at the forge. And as of now, there is no cooldown so you can use it repeatedly as many times as you like.
 
That sums up this guide on how to craft and get Obliterator. If you like playing Valheim and are having trouble with the Thunder Stone be sure to check our guide on how to get Thunder Stone in Valheim.
