Title: Secret Revealed: How to Find the Hidden Spade Gulch in Grounded!

Introduction:
Grounded is an exciting survival game that has captured the attention of gamers worldwide since its release in 2020. The game takes place in a backyard where players control a shrunken person, trying to survive amidst the dangers of nature. There are various locations within the game, including the hidden Spade Gulch, which players may find a little challenging to locate. In this article, we reveal the secret to finding Spade Gulch, providing gamers with a walkthrough of the steps they need to take to get there.

Step 1: Open the Map
The first step to locating Spade Gulch in Grounded is to open the map. To do this, press `Tab` on your keyboard if you are using a PC or `options` if you are on a console. Once the map is open, locate the place where you spawned on the map; this should be the green marker on your map.

Step 2: Head Southeast
After locating your spawn point, head southeast. Keep going in this direction until you come across a big oak tree. Around the oak tree, you will see an assortment of grass, rocks, and clovers - this is the area where the Spade Gulch is hidden.

Step 3: Check the Ground for a Wooden Hatch
To access the Spade Gulch, you must find a wooden hatch on the ground. To do this, search the area around the oak tree. The hatch may be hidden under the grass, so be sure to look carefully. Once you find the hatch, you will need to equip an axe to break it open.

Step 4: Enter Spade Gulch
After breaking the hatch open, you will see a ladder leading down into the Spade Gulch. Climb down the ladder, and you will find yourself in a cavern with walls made of clay, stone, and dirt. There are also tunnels in the cave that you can explore.

Step 5: Explore and Survive
Once you are in the Spade Gulch, you can explore and survive like in the rest of the game. You will find valuable resources such as clay, mushrooms, and quartzite. However, beware of the dangers that lurk in the cave, such as spiders, weevils, and ladybugs. Be sure to bring your weapons and tools along.

Conclusion:
In summary, finding the hidden Spade Gulch in Grounded requires going southeast from the spawn point and looking for a wooden hatch hidden under the grass around the big oak tree. Once you find the hatch, break it open, and climb down the ladder to access the Spade Gulch. While exploring the cave, be prepared to face the dangers of nature and look out for useful items to collect. Now that you know the secret to finding Spade Gulch, go forth, and enjoy all that the game has to offer!

Grounded is a survival game where the protagonist is shrunk to the size of an ant. You will have to travel and survive through dangerous landscapes. In this game, you will come across BURG.L, a friendly robot who will send you on quests. These quests will help you earn Raw Science, which is an important form of currency in Grounded. One of the quests he will send you is the Spade Gulch marker. In this article, we will tell you where to find Spade Gulch in Grounded.
 
## Where to Find the Spade Gulch in Grounded
 

 
It is tricky to find the Spade Gulch because the marker is not on the Yard map. Spade Gulch is located in the Grasslands near the Eastern Flooded Zone and the Eastern Flower Bed. As the name suggests, look for a spade sticking out of the ground. You will find the area littered with acorns. The area is filled with many insects so we suggest you go in prepared. One of the most dangerous insects you will come across here is the Bombardier Beetle. They are hostile and quite lethal. Be aware of their acid-spraying abilities or you won’t leave the area alive. Examine the area and you will come across a shallow ditch. Once you enter it, you will find a blue flashing marker. You can build the marker with the ingredients you carried. You will receive Raw Science for completing the quest.
 
### Things You Should Carry
 
BURG.L will send you to Spade Gulch to complete the marker quest in Grounded. You will find a blueprint there but you will need these ingredients to build it:
 
- Sprig x2
 - Clover Leaf x1
 - Plant Fibre x2

 
To tackle the Bombardier Beetle or the Stinkbug, you should have:
 
- A Tier 1 Armor
 - A Tier 1 or Tier 2 Weapon
 - Gas Mask or Gastro Goo

 
These should be enough to successfully complete the quest. We hope this article helped you to find the Spade Gulch in Grounded. For more articles, visit our Grounded section.
