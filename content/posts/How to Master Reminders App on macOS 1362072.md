# Unlock Time Management Superpowers with These Reminders App Hacks for macOS

Time management is one of the most important skills you can possess in today’s world. With hectic schedules and never-ending tasks, it’s essential to make the most of your time to succeed in your personal and professional life. Fortunately, macOS makes it easy to manage your time with the Reminders app. Here, we’ve listed some powerful reminders app hacks that can help you unlock your time management superpowers, and stay on top of your to-do list every day.

## Make a Comprehensive To-Do List

The first step to effective time management is to organize all of your tasks into a comprehensive to-do list. This creates a roadmap for completing all of your priorities on time. The Reminders app on macOS can group your tasks into categories, set due dates, and even generate notifications when they’re due. Make sure you’re adding everything to your to-do list, from small errands like grocery shopping to big project milestones. A comprehensive to-do list keeps you on track, and helps ensure you don’t miss a deadline or forget a task.

## Customize Alerts and Notifications

The Reminders app can send alerts and notifications based on your preferences, whether it’s through pop-ups, sound alerts, or email. Customize the notifications so they’re tailored to your needs. For instance, you can set up alerts for due dates, upcoming events, and even location-based reminders, like picking up items on your grocery list when you pass by the supermarket. By personalizing the notifications, you stay informed and on top of your schedule.

## Prioritize with Tags

Sometimes a to-do list can become overwhelming, with dozens of tasks competing for priority. Reminders allows you to tag and categorize your tasks, making it easier to prioritize. Create tags based on priority, such as “urgent,” “important,” or “nice to have”. Assigning a priority can help you manage your tasks better by focusing on the most important tasks first, saving time and reducing stress levels.

## Use Siri and Voice Commands

Siri can assist you in setting reminders, scheduling events, and even creating to-do lists. Activate Siri on your macOS device by saying “Hey Siri” or by clicking the microphone icon. You can ask Siri to create a new reminder, set a due date or assignment, and even ask for a status update on the tasks you’ve already assigned. Voice commands can streamline your productivity and help you avoid the tedious process of typing out task lists.

## Share Tasks

Collaboration and delegation are vital in the workplace. The Reminders app on macOS allows you to share tasks with colleagues, friends, or family by email or messages. You can assign tasks to others, receive updates on progress, and even obtain real-time access to the same to-do list as your collaborators. Sharing tasks can help increase productivity by reducing redundancy and ensuring everyone knows what needs to be done.

In conclusion, the Reminders app on macOS can be a powerful tool for time management. With these reminders app hacks, you can create a comprehensive to-do list, customize alerts and notifications, categorize with tags, use Siri and voice commands, and share tasks with others. By utilizing these tips, you can increase your productivity and unlock your time management superpowers, allowing you to achieve more with your time every day.

The macOS Reminders app has always been a good way to create tasks and manage your to-do lists. Released all the way back in iOS 5 and Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, it has become a staple of Apple’s default app lineup. Even as it has plenty of competition from third parties, Apple has continued to beef up its capabilities. That’s especially true over the past 18 months, as Apple has redesigned the app almost from the ground up. Let’s take a look at how you can quickly master the improved Reminders app on the Mac.
 
## How to Create a Reminder
 
There are three primary ways to create a new reminder. None is better than the other, but they each provide a way to get something added to the Reminders app quickly. The first way is to do it directly from the app itself:
 
1. Open the Reminders app and tap on the list you want (left side) or tap “Add List” toward the bottom of the app.
 
2. Tap the “+” sign at the top right, write your reminder and click Done.
 
### Use Siri:
 
1. Say “Hey Siri, (insert your reminder)”. It might look something like “Hey Siri, remind me to drop the dog off at 3pm“. That’s it.
 
2. Siri can also understand location-based reminders as well if you have your home or work addresses enabled in your contacts.
 
### Using the Share Pane
 
All of Apple’s default apps and a variety of third-party options include the Share pane.
 
1. To set a reminder, click the Share button, and a pop-up window opens.
 
2. Inside this pop-up, you can choose which list you want to add the reminder to, add an image, set a priority level and more.
 
## Smart Lists
 
Smart lists are the four pre-chosen selections that are available on the left side of the Reminders app.
 
- “Today will show any reminder that you’ve set for today’s date. Overdue tasks will appear here as well.“Scheduled” will show any reminder that you have assigned a due date.“All” will show all of your outstanding reminders, repeat or otherwise. This is an all-encompassing look at everything you have left to complete.“Flagged” will show any reminder that has been flagged. A prime example of flagged is a doctor’s appointment. When adding the Reminder, click on the flag icon right beneath where you enter your reminder text. It will automatically appear in the “Flagged” smart list within a few moments.

 
## Subtasks
 
Another very handy feature of the Reminders app is the ability to create subtasks. You can use subtasks to help divide a specific reminder into a number of different steps.
 
1. Enter the task or reminder that will become the “primary” or “parent” task.
 
2. Add a second task that will become the subtask.
 
3. Right-click on the second task using your mouse or trackpad. A pop-up menu will appear. Select the option “Indent Reminder.”
 
4. The second task will now automatically move into a subtask position.
 
## Add Images to Reminders
 
The Reminders app now lets you add an image with reminders. It’s really easy.
 
1. Enter any task or reminder that you wish to add an image to.
 
2. Click on the “i” that is to the right of any task.
 
3. The last option on the pop-up window has an option for “Add image.”
 
4. Click on that option and add any image from your library by dragging it into your chosen reminder.
 
5. Add multiple images by repeating the same steps and dragging multiple photos into the Reminders app.
 
## Edit Reminders
 
None of your reminders are written in stone. They can all be edited countless times without any impact.
 
1. Enter a reminder into the app.
 
3. A now-familiar pop-up window will appear with a variety of options. Edit the reminder by placing the mouse cursor anywhere in the text and typing.
 
4. This is also the right moment to go back and add a due date, location, priority, or a website URL that relates to the reminder as well as images.
 
## Messaging Reminders
 
This is an interesting and useful option that Apple has included in its Reminders app. The app can send you a notification when you’re using iMessage with a specific person that has been preselected. When adding a reminder, click the box that says “When Messaging a Person” and select them from your contact list. The next time you chat with that person over iMessage, you will receive a notification about the reminder.
 
## iCloud Sync
 
As is the case with most of Apple’s default apps, iCloud ensures that any macOS reminders are synced directly to your iPhone and/or Apple Watch. You will see the same reminders, tasks, smart lists, custom lists, subtasks and more.
 
## Wrapping Up
 
The macOS Reminders app has taken massive steps forward over the last two years, especially with the release of iOS 13 and macOS Catalina. The app is by no means perfect and lacks many features third-party apps are happy to fill the gap with. However, it’s more than good enough to stay on top of any day-to-day or repeat tasks that you need to constantly remember.
