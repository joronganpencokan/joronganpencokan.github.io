Unlock The Ultimate Secret: Learn How To Screen Record Like A Pro On Your iPhone!

Are you struggling to figure out how to screen record on your iPhone? Don't worry, you're not alone. Screen recording can be a powerful tool for creating tutorials, capturing gameplay footage, or simply saving a moment to share with friends or family. In this article, we'll show you how to screen record on your iPhone like a pro using the built-in features.

First Things First: Setting Up Your iPhone For Screen Recording

Before you can start recording your iPhone screen, you need to enable the screen recording feature. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your iPhone's Settings app.

2. Scroll until you see Control Center and tap it.

3. Tap Customize Controls.

4. Find and tap the green plus sign next to Screen Recording to add it to Control Center.

Now that you've added the screen recording feature to your Control Center, you're ready to start creating your own screen recordings.

Step 1: Open Control Center

To access the screen recorder, swipe down from the top-right corner of your iPhone's screen to open Control Center. You should see a circle with a dot inside it. Tap the circle to start recording.

Step 2: Choose Audio Settings (Optional)

Before you start recording, you’ll see some options for your microphone. You can turn your microphone on if you want to record your voice or leave it off if you don't want any external sounds to be recorded.

Step 3: Start Recording

Once you're ready to start recording, tap the circle with the dot inside to begin. A three-second countdown will appear before the recording starts, allowing you to prepare.

Step 4: End Recording

To stop the recording, tap the red icon in the top-left corner of your screen. Alternatively, you can swipe up from the bottom of your screen and tap the circle with the dot inside again.

Step 5: Save and Edit Your Recording

Once you've finished recording, your iPhone will automatically save the video file to your Photos app. From there, you can trim, edit, and share the video with friends or family.

Conclusion

Now that you know how to screen record on your iPhone, you can start creating your own tutorials, gameplays, or even documenting ridiculous arguments you have with your friends on social media. It's important to remember to respect other people's privacy and permission if recording your friends or family members. Now go forth and start recording like a pro!

## How to screen record on any iPhone
 
Materials needed: Any iPhone running iOS 14.0 or laterEstimated time: Less than 1 minute
 
### 1. Open your Settings app and find "Control Center"


Apple added a quick, easy way to record your screen with iOS 14 in 2020, but you'll need to enable it before you can use it. To do this, open your Settings app and find Control Center (as seen above in the red rectangle).

 
### 2. Add the Screen Recording button to your Control Center


Once you're in the Control Center section, you'll see a couple of toggles, an "Included Controls" section with all of the options that have already been added to your Control Center, and a section called "More Controls." 
Depending on how many controls you have active, you may need to scroll down a bit to see this. In the More Controls section, find Screen Recording (as seen above in the red rectangle) and tap the green + icon to its left. This will add it to the Included Controls section and make it accessible via Control Center. 

 
### 3. Open your Control Center


Next, you'll want to open Control Center. This can be done from your home screen, or from within the vast majority of iPhone apps. For iPhones without a physical Home Button, you can access it by swiping down from the top-right corner of the display. 
For iPhones with a physical Home Button, you can access it by swiping up from the bottom of the display. Once it's open, scroll through your options until you see the button that looks like a solid circle within a hollow circle, like the one circled in red above.

 
### 4. Begin screen recording


When you're ready to begin recording, tap the Screen Recording button. This starts a 3-second countdown. At the end of it, the recording will begin. This countdown time can be used to close the Control Center and get back to the true subject of your Screen Recording before the video capture actually begins. 
While recording is active, the Screen Recording button in Control Center will turn white and the icon within it will turn red, to indicate recording is active. The clock on the top left of your display will also be surrounded by a red indicator (as seen below).

 
### Step 5: Record


This is when you'll want to complete whatever task it is you wanted to screen record. Once you've finished recording your task, move on to the final step below.

 
### 5. End your recording


When you're ready to end your recording, there are two ways to stop it. The first is to tap the red clock in the top left of your screen. This will produce a dialogue box like the one seen above. You'll need to tap "Stop" to end your recording. If you're in a full-screen app that hides the clock, you can also once again pull out your Control Center and tap the Screen Recording button. If you use this second method, the recording will end immediately, with no confirmation required. 
In both cases, the recording you just produced will immediately be saved to your Photos library. In the Photos app, you can play it back, share it, edit it, and do all of the same things you could with a video you captured using your iPhone's built-in camera.

Techsmith Capture - A straightforward screen recorder app that works almost identically to the built-in process, but supports adding real-time narration using the iPhone's built-in microphones.RecordIt! - A slightly more complex option that also allows for real-time narration or post-capture editing. It also supports face cam captures, so you can record your screen and yourself at the same time. Screen Recorder + - A similar option to RecordIt!, Screen Recorder + touts its ability to start up in just one second, for those spur-of-the-moment captures.


Be aware that some apps, particularly email and messaging apps that don't rely on Apple's iMessage platform, might have size limits that screen recordings, especially longer ones, can exceed.
