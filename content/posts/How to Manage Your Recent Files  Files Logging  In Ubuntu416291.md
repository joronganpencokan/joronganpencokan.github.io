If you are always buried under files and folders on your Ubuntu system, then you must already know how difficult it can be to manage your recent files.

But if you cannot manage files efficiently, then it can be a challenge to make the most of the system. In this article, we will explore some tips and techniques that will help you revolutionize your file management game and make your life easier.

Revolutionize Your File Management Game: Tips and Techniques

1. Use Ubuntu's built-in search tool

One easy way to manage your recent files on Ubuntu is to use the system's search tool. Ubuntu's search feature is built into the file manager, which makes it convenient to use. All you need to do is open the file manager and type in the name of the file in the search bar. The system will list all the files that match the name, and you can quickly access them.

2. Customize your file manager

Ubuntu's file manager comes with a variety of options to customize the user interface to suit your needs. You can change the way files and folders are displayed, add or remove toolbars, and change the colors and fonts used in the interface. These customizable features enable you to set up your file manager to look the way you want it to, making it easier for you to manage files.

3. Use keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are a great time-saver and will enable you to navigate your files quickly. Ubuntu's file manager has a range of keyboard shortcuts that you can use to perform tasks such as opening a file, copying or moving files, and creating new folders. Learning these shortcuts will make it easier for you to manage your files.

4. Organize your files into folders

Organizing your files into folders will make it easier for you to manage them. Create folders for different types of files, such as documents, images, videos, and music, and move files into them for better organization. When you organize your files, you will be able to find them more easily, reducing the time it takes to manage them.

5. Use third-party file managers

Ubuntu has many third-party file managers available that can help you manage your recent files more effectively. Some popular file managers include Nautilus, Nemo, Thunar, and Dolphin. These file managers have different features and interfaces, so you can choose one that suits your needs.

Conclusion

Managing recent files on Ubuntu can be a challenge, but with the right tips and techniques, you can revolutionize your file management game. Using Ubuntu's built-in search tool, customizing your file manager, using keyboard shortcuts, organizing your files into folders, and using third-party file managers are all excellent ways to manage your files more efficiently.

The Zeitgeist Engine is a service that logs the users’s activities and events (files opened, websites visites, conversations hold with other people, etc.) and makes relevant information available to other applications. In the recent releases of Ubuntu, the Zeitgeist engine was installed by default, and that is why you are starting to see “Recent Files” showing up in your Nautilus file manager and other applications. 
 
Let’s say that you are using a household computer and you love to watch late night movie (aka. porn) on it, the last thing you want your family members to see is the name of the movie showing up on the “Recent Files” list every time they open the Nautilus file manager.

 
## Activity Log Manager Comes to the Rescue
 
The Activity Log Manager is one useful app that controls the behavior of Zeitgeist. You can use it to delete all your file logging history and configure it to log only certain applications or files. 
 
To install:
 
This is what you see on first run:
 
 
 
There are three tabs: History, Applications and Files. In the History tab, you can delete file log for the past 15 minutes, or up to past week, or if you want, define your own time range.
 
The Application tab is where you can blacklist Application and prevent logging of any activity on these applications. So if you are using VLC to watch movie, you can add VLC into this tab.
 

 
To make it even better, you can blacklist specific file types and folders. In this case, you probably want to select the video format and videos directory in order to keep your “track” clean.
 
## Turning it off
 
For those who prefer to turn the file logging off completely rather than configuring each individual item, you can simply click the “Tick” button at the right bottom corner. The default is “Logging Active”. Give it a click and you will see the “Logging Stopped” text. 
 
## Conclusion
 
(Recent) File logging is definitely a useful way to help you retrieve your files faster and improve your productivity. However, extensive file logging can also be an intrusion of your privacy, especially if you are using a shared computer. Being able to control what to log and what not to log is definitely a good way to protect your privacy without compromising your productivity.
