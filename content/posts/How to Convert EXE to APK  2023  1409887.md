The recent upsurge of Android devices has slowly started to make laptops and PCs a thing of the past. The compact size of the smartphone, along with its extreme computational power, makes it the ideal replacement for your PC. However, replicating elegant PC software into compressed Android applications is a challenging task for many users. If you want to increase the functionality of your smartphone and wish to run PC apps on your Android, here’s a guide that that will help you figure out how to convert EXE files to APK.
 
What are APK and EXE files?
 
Every software requires a setup file that enables its installation process. This singular setup file installs the software and simultaneously creates all the files necessary for the smooth functioning of the app. On a Windows device, the setup file ends with a .exe extension and is thus called an EXE file, whereas, on the Android platform, the extension is .apk and hence the name, APK file. While both files are dissimilar, created to run on entirely different platforms, developers around the world recognized the need to be able to convert BAT to EXE and EXE files to APK. Read ahead to find out how you can do the same.

If you are unable to convert the file, then surf through the net, and if you are lucky, you may find an Android application that serves the same purpose as the Windows software you were trying to convert.
