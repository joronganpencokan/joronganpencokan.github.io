Are you tired of playing video games with lackluster graphics? Do you have a passion for old-school gaming and want to create stunning 8-bit graphics? Look no further than Cosmigo Pro Motion NG.

Cosmigo Pro Motion NG is a powerful graphics editor that specializes in pixel art and animation. With its intuitive interface and extensive set of tools, you can easily unleash your inner gaming genius and bring your ideas to life.

One of the key features of Cosmigo Pro Motion NG is its ability to create and edit tilesets. Tilesets are essentially a collection of graphics, which are repeated to create a larger image. This is a common technique used in old school game design, particularly in games for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).

Cosmigo Pro Motion NG allows you to easily create unique tilesets from scratch or import existing ones to modify. The program also features a real-time preview of how the tileset will look in action, allowing you to make changes and adjustments on the fly.

Another exciting feature of Cosmigo Pro Motion NG is its animation capabilities. The program offers frame-by-frame animation, allowing you to create smooth and intricate animated sprites for your games. You can also use the timeline feature to create complex animations with ease.

If you're new to pixel art and animation, don't worry. Cosmigo Pro Motion NG includes an extensive library of tutorials and resources to help you get started. From basic pixel art techniques to advanced animation tricks, you'll find everything you need to unleash your creativity.

In conclusion, Cosmigo Pro Motion NG is a must-have tool for anyone interested in old-school gaming and pixel art. Its powerful set of tools, intuitive interface, and extensive library of resources make it easy for anyone to create stunning 8-bit graphics and animation. Whether you're a hobbyist or a professional game developer, Cosmigo Pro Motion NG has everything you need to unleash your inner gaming genius.


It’s easy to assume that because we have nearly unlimited resources to use for graphics in the 21st Century that 8-bit graphics are old-school, nostalgic remnants of a time gone by. Of course if you’ve been paying attention, you’ll know that 8-bit graphics have been having a resurgence and many game developers and artists fully embrace the oldstyle graphics for their current work.
 
In this article we look at Cosmigo Pro Motion NG, the 8-bit graphics tool of choice.
 
## What’s up with 8-bit?
 
In the 80s and 90s computers were much less sophisticated. However, people got used to the limitations and did great graphics anyway. The same goes double for games; the machines were crude, but that just meant you had to work a lot harder to do something that looked good.
 
Fast forward to 2017, and Cosmigo Pro Motion NG is the go-to graphics program for the next generation of 8-bit artists (hence the NG part). The software has been around since 1997 and, although it lay dormant for a few years, is having a rise in popularity as the graphics engine of choice for serious modern 8-bit artists.
 

 
The software is mainly for Windows but can be used on Mac and Linux through Wine. It is free but can also be upgraded to the pro version with more features for $50.

Pro Motion NG is a very different way of working. If you are used to Photoshop, then there are two things that are going to bug you:
 
- All the common keyboard shortcuts are different
 - All the tools you rely on to easily make graphics are not there

 
Don’t worry about the first one, as you can change the keyboard shortcuts to match the Photoshop ones you are used to. As for the second one, the tools work differently, and you will have to hit a learning curve, there are no shortcuts to proficiency there.
 
Down the side you have a toolbar, but the tools work in a different way. You are not really sketching and drawing like you would on a modern drawing package. You are building the images like LEGOs out of pixels. So, working on 8-bit art means you work zoomed in most of the time, much more extreme zooms than you would normally, and you work on a pixel-to-pixel level.
 
Zooming in and out is easy with the centre mouse wheel, and moving about the canvas uses the space bar to make a hand tool, as with some modern packages.
 
8-bit graphics programs used to work on brushes, that is to say where you draw something, grab it as a brush and then stamp it on the page. So in order to move something, you have to grab it as a brush, then stamp it elsewhere and delete it where it used to be with the right mouse button.
 
Another old-fashioned concept Pro Motion makes use of is a special holding space called the brushes container, and in this you can store brushes you’ve grabbed from the main art. Tricks you can do with this are storing a palette from a brush and then remapping that onto the artwork.
 
You can also create animated brushes, brushes which store all the layers of animation underlying the top graphic, so you can stamp the animation around the screen. There is also some amazing and flexible onion skinning in the program, making it easier to animate a character by making the previous frames (and even the subsequent frames if you want) visible on the current frame.
 
You have to get good at palette management, and Pro Motion helps you with that with a lot of extra tools to help you move, copy and remap the palette colours for the image so that you can keep them neat and organized. Notice the little Remap button.
 
This way you can move all the colors around, then make the colors of the image go back to what they were before.
 
Finally, another thing which was big in the 8-bit world was a thing called “color cycling.” Animation was made by structuring certain areas of the color palette so that when the colors were cycled through you would get a crude animation. Games used this to amazing effect to make a still image with moving water or skies. Think of it like those neon signs which have two or three different poses for an arm or leg and cycle through, lighting each one in turn. Pro Motion is the only tool we can think of which makes it easy to create color-cycled images. (See the video below for some great examples of what can be done.)
 
For the creation of icons, sprites for games, animated GIFs or retro-looking pixel art, there’s no better tool available, free or paid. For making animated GIFs, there’s actually nothing else which springs to mind which is even half as good. For example, the animation below was the same animated brush stamped repeatedly over the page. Quick and simple.
 
## Conclusion
 
8-bit graphics can be an exciting playground to explore new ways (or more accurately old ways) to make images and provide yourself with the creative stimulus of having fewer rather than greater options. There’s so much more to Pro Motion NG than we have the scope to talk about here, but take our advice: go get it and have a play. It’s either just a nostalgic walk in the graphics world of yesterday or the beginning of a whole new hobby. Aren’t you curious to find out which?
