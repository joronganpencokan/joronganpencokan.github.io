Attention all Jedi knights and Star Wars fans! The highly anticipated video game, Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, has finally been released, and it is time to unleash the force within and learn the secret tricks to interacting with red glowing objects.

As you journey through various planets and face daunting challenges, you will encounter several red glowing objects that cannot be interacted with in the same way as other items. These objects require a specific technique that can only be mastered by those who have a deep understanding of the force and its power.

To interact with the red glowing objects, you must use the force to slow them down, freeze them in place, and then redirect them towards their intended target. This technique, known as Force Slow, is a fundamental ability that all Jedi knights must master to progress through the game.

But what if you find yourself in a situation where you cannot use Force Slow? Fear not, for there are other techniques that you can use to interact with these objects. For instance, you can use your lightsaber to reflect the red glow back to its source, destroying the object in the process.

Another trick to interacting with red glowing objects is to use the environment to your advantage. You may find that certain objects can be knocked down or moved using the force, creating a clear path to your target.

The key to mastering these tricks is to practice and experiment. As you gain more experience, you will learn how to read your environment and use the force to your advantage in creative ways.

In addition to interacting with red glowing objects, there are several other powers that you must master to become a true Jedi knight. These include the ability to jump higher, sprint faster, and even communicate with animals.

So, are you ready to unleash the force within and become a master of Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order? With these secret tricks to interacting with red glowing objects, you will be one step closer to achieving Jedi status and fulfilling your destiny in a galaxy far, far away. May the force be with you!
