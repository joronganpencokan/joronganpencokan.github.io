Selecting the small icon size allows you to see more information in a Finder window. Choosing the large icon displays more detail.
 - Text size: This drop-down menu lets you specify the text size used for an item’s name and the attributes that display in each column.
 - Show columns: In addition to the column indicating the name of an item or file, there are several optional columns for Finder to display. They include:

 - Date Created: The date when the item was originally created.
 - Date Last Opened: Lists the date of the last time the items were opened by any user or app.

If you select this button by accident, you may not be pleased to discover that every Finder window now displays its contents with Cover Flow.
