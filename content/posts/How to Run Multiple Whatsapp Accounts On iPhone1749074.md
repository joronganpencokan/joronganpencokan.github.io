Messenger Duo for WhatsApp is not an app cloner; it’s just an app that provides you with the mobile version of WhatsApp Web. So, you will log in to WhatsApp with your secondary number on WhatsApp’s web version. Here’s how to use Messenger Duo for WhatsApp.


 

First of all, download & install Messenger Duo for WhatsApp on your iPhone.
Once installed, open the app and switch to the Dual tab. This will open the mobile version of WhatsApp web.
Now, on your second device, open WhatsApp Messenger and head to Settings > Link a device. Now scan the QR code displayed on the Messenger Duo for WhatsApp.
