# Stop Seeing Annoying Posts Forever: The Ultimate Guide on Muting Topic Channels on Instagram Explore Tab!

Instagram is the most popular social media platform with over 1 billion active users worldwide. The Explore tab of Instagram is a great feature that allows you to discover new content, accounts, and communities. However, sometimes you come across posts that are annoying or irrelevant to you. What if I told you there is a way to stop seeing them forever?

Introducing the Instagram mute feature! This function is not just for muting annoying followers, but also to mute entire topic channels on the Explore tab. Here is the ultimate guide on how to mute topic channels on Instagram Explore tab.

## Step 1: Accessing the Topic Channel

The first step to muting a topic channel is to access it. You can do this by clicking on any post on the Explore tab that belongs to the channel you want to mute. Once you are on the post page, look for the “More” icon (three vertical dots) on the top right corner of the post.

Click on the “More” icon, and a drop-down menu will appear. From the menu, select “Don’t show for this hashtag.” This step will mute the entire topic channel, and you will not see any posts from the hashtag in the Explore tab again.

## Step 2: Check Your Muted Hashtags List

To make sure you have successfully muted the topic channel, go to your profile page and click on the three horizontal lines on the top right corner of your screen. This icon will take you to the settings menu.

Scroll down until you find the “Privacy” section and click on “Muted.” This section will display all the hashtags and accounts you have muted on Instagram. If the topic channel you just muted is not on the list, repeat step 1.

## Step 3: Unmute a Muted Hashtag or Account

At times you may want to unmute a hashtag you previously muted. If that’s the case, you can do it by going to the “Muted” section on the settings menu and selecting the hashtag you want to unmute. You can then either click on “Unmute” or swipe left on the hashtag and select “Unmute” from the options that pop up.

In conclusion, muting a topic channel can help you customize your Instagram experience and stop seeing annoying or irrelevant posts. Follow these easy steps to mute and unmute hashtags on Instagram. Enjoy a clutter-free Explore tab!

Not long ago two major updates were rolled out by Instagram on its app. One was the ability to do group video calling by creating groups on Instagram and another was a revamped Explore section. In this article, we will talk about the new Explore tab. Instagram has added personalized channels at the top that will help you to navigate easily and find your interests quickly. There is a For You channel which has a blend of photos & videos from the topics that interest you. Apart from that, you will find several other channels along with hashtags personalized for you. In case you don’t like any of them then you can hide or mute topic channels on Instagram explore. Here’s how.
 
In case you are happy with the channels but not with the posts shown inside them then we have also mentioned the steps you can take to fix irrelevant posts in your explore feed.
 
To remove the topic channels you can use the steps below.
 
## Mute Channels On Instagram Explore
 
Note: I have used the screenshots from the Android app but iOS users won’t face any issue while following.
 
1. Open the Instagram app and go to Explore by tapping on the search icon at the bottom.
 
2. Under Explore, you will see the channels personalized for you. Long press on the channel you wish to remove until you see a Menu.
 

 
3. Select Mute [Channel Name].
 
That’s it! The topic channel will move to the end of the tray and will be grayed out.
 
Similarly, you can mute other channels if desired.
 
It is possible to unmute the channel by going at the end of the channel tray at the top and selecting the muted channel. After that, tap on Unmute.
 
Alternatively, you can also press and hold on the muted channel and select Unmute [Channel Name] to make it show up again in your channel tray.
 
## Fix Instagram Explore Irrelevant Posts
 
The Explore section can help you discover photos & videos that are interesting to you easily. However, when it goes wrong you can use the method below to get it back on track by resetting it, sort of!
 
1. Open Instagram and go to the Explore tab by tapping on the search icon at the bottom row.
 
2. In Explore section, tap on the photo/video that you don’t want to see in future.
 
3. When the photo/video opens tap on the 3 dots at the top right of the post and select See Fewer Posts Like This.
 
Your feedback will be received and Instagram will take it into consideration while curating posts for your Explore section. Also, note that it won’t change instantly. With time, based on your feedback your Explore section will be back to normal. So, keep using the steps above to report irrelevant posts and you’ll soon start seeing the right things in Explore.

Channels have made the content more organized in the Explore feed. They act like categories and you can select the desired one and swipe up to find relevant content and accounts you want to follow under that. And giving the control to the user to decide what sort of channels show up in their feed makes it even better. What’s your take on this?
