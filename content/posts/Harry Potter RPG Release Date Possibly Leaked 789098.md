Fans of Harry Potter have been eagerly awaiting the release of the open-world RPG game for months now. Well, we at Hugo have some good news for you. The release date has been leaked, and it's sooner than you think!

According to industry sources, the game is set to hit stores on November 20th later this year. While this may still feel far off, it's important to note that earlier speculation had suggested that the game wouldn't be released until 2022. So, November really is just around the corner!

Developed by Avalanche Software, the game is rumored to be titled "Hogwarts Legacy." The game will take place in the late 1800s, before the events of the Harry Potter novels. Players will reportedly be able to create their own character and attend classes, as well as explore the wizarding world outside of Hogwarts.

This is exciting news for Harry Potter fans for a number of reasons. Firstly, an open-world game set in the wizarding world of Harry Potter is something that many fans have been petitioning for for years. With the game now looking like a reality, people can finally live out their dreams of attending Hogwarts, exploring the Forbidden Forest, and riding broomsticks.

Additionally, the leaked release date means that fans will finally be able to get their hands on the game well in time for the holiday season. Given the popularity of Harry Potter, this could potentially make for an incredibly popular gift come Christmas time.

It's worth noting that, as of yet, none of this information has been confirmed by either Avalanche Software or Warner Bros. Interactive, the game's publisher. It also remains to be seen how the ongoing coronavirus pandemic may impact the development or release of the game.

Nevertheless, for now, Harry Potter fans can take heart in the fact that their wait for a Harry Potter RPG may soon be at an end. Hogwarts Legacy is shaping up to be an unforgettable experience that fans of the series will undoubtedly love.

If you may recall, a Harry Potter RPG developed by Avalanche Software has been leaked years ago. Since then there has been no news about the game and many fans are wondering why. But apparently the project of the game was not canceled and soon we could have news about it.
 
Today, a leak related to Harry Potter RPG allegedly comes from Reddit, where a dubbing actor claims to have received information about a request to localize (currently with subtitles) a new Harry Potter video game, which will release in 2021.
 
The Reddit user says that the company had kept the project a secret and that Warner Bros. would have commissioned this localization and also the language for which they are applying for the job (although he claims that it is a non-English speaking European country), but considered that it must be the leaked game some time ago.
 
The truth is that it could be the highly anticipated RPG from Warner Bros. or any other project. At the moment, it cannot be ruled out that it is a new mobile game or any other non-game project that everyone wants. At the moment we can only wait and if the plan is to debut in 2021 it is possible that the announcement will be made in the coming months before the end of 2020.
 
It has been nine years since this project has a video game of the main saga, since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 2 was released. Later we have had LEGO video games and mobile games like Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, but there is nothing yet announced in the Rowling universe with a good role-playing action game in the open world.
 
In any case, we would like to invite all our readers to take this information with due precautions, waiting for an official confirmation from the publishers.
