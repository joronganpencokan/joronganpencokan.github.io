Installing software on Linux systems can be challenging, especially for new users. However, the process of installing Freeoffice in Linux is surprisingly easy, and you won't believe how quickly you can get it set up on your machine. In this article, we'll show you step-by-step what you need to do to get Freeoffice up and running in Linux with just a few clicks.

What is Freeoffice?

Before we dive into the installation process, let's take a look at what Freeoffice is. Freeoffice is a powerful office suite that includes word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation software. It's compatible with Microsoft Office, meaning that you can open and edit Microsoft Office documents without encountering any file format issues. Freeoffice includes several other features, such as spell checking, formatting, and charting tools, that make it an excellent alternative to its proprietary competitors.

Getting Started

To get started with the installation process, you need to navigate to the Freeoffice website and download the Linux version of the software. Click on the 'Download' button, and select the Linux version from the list of options available. Once you've downloaded the package, you'll need to extract it to a temporary folder. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder where you extracted the package.

Installation

To install Freeoffice in Linux, you'll need to run the 'installfreeoffice' script that's included with the package. To do this, open the terminal, navigate to the folder that contains the extracted package, and run the following command:

sudo ./installfreeoffice.sh

This will start the installation process, and you'll be prompted to accept the license agreement. Once you've agreed to the terms, the installation process will begin, and all the necessary packages will be downloaded and installed.

Configuration

After the installation process is complete, you'll need to configure Freeoffice to work with your system. To do this, open Freeoffice and select the 'Tools' menu. Click on 'Options,' and then select the 'Paths' tab. Enter the following paths in the appropriate fields:

/usr/share/freeoffice2018/bin
/usr/share/freeoffice2018/share/config
/usr/share/freeoffice2018/share/fonts

Once you've entered the paths, click 'OK,' and Freeoffice will be configured to work with your system.

Conclusion

In conclusion, installing Freeoffice in Linux is easy, and the entire process can be completed in just a few clicks. With Freeoffice's compatibility with Microsoft Office and its extensive feature set, it's an excellent alternative to proprietary office suites. Whether you're a new Linux user or a seasoned veteran, Freeoffice is worth checking out.

FreeOffice is the freeware version of SoftMaker Office, considered one of the best alternatives to Microsoft Office on Linux. With its three different office applications, FreeOffice provides a robust substitute for Word, Excel and PowerPoint that will run on most Linux machines.
 
Below, we’ll cover how to install FreeOffice in Linux as well as an overview of its features and drawbacks.
 
## Installing FreeOffice
 
To start, head to the official FreeOffice website and navigate to the downloads page. There you’ll be able to select the version that works best for your system. The Linux version of the FreeOffice software package is available in three different file formats: DEB, RPM and TGZ.
 
### For Debian-based distro
 
If your machine is running Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint or any other Debian-based distro, you’ll need to download the DEB package. Once downloaded, you can double-click it to open the installer. Alternatively, if your distro doesn’t support the graphical installer, you can either install gdebi or simply run the command in the terminal:
 
### Fedora/OpenSuse
 
If you’re running Fedora, openSUSE or any other distribution that uses RPM packages, you’ll need to download the RPM version of the package. Install it with the command:
 
### For others
 
If you’re not running a distro that can install RPM or DEB files, you’ll need to use the tarball package. Download the TGZ package, then extract it as shown below.
 
Navigate to the extracted folder and run the installation script.
 
## FreeOffice Review and Features
 
FreeOffice comes with versions of the three classic office applications:
 
- TextMaker – word processing
 - PlanMaker – spreadsheet
 - Presentations – slideshow presentation

 
Upon startup, you’ll need to choose between two interface sets: ribbons for those familiar with Microsoft Office and a classic option for those who prefer old-school word processors. You’ll then be able to launch any of the three apps.
 

 
The first of these, TextMaker, is a fairly robust piece of word processing software. It isn’t as full-fledged as Microsoft Office, and power users may be disappointed by its more limited feature set. TextMaker does, however, fill just about 100 percent of the needs of a casual user.
 
PlanMaker is a spreadsheet app with similar functionality to Microsoft Excel and other open spreadsheet software. If you’ve worked with programs like Excel or OpenOffice Calc, you will feel right at home.
 
The same is true of Presentations, the slideshow app. It’s not nearly as fancy as PowerPoint – and may feel a little bit outdated, even by open-source slideshow standards – but it gets the job done.
 
In general, FreeOffice will seem a little pared down compared to both Microsoft Office and the other big-name open-source word processors, OpenOffice and LibreOffice. And there are a few limitations to the software you’ll need to keep in mind: while you can open .docx and .pptx files, you won’t be able to save them, for example.
 
But with such a small memory footprint and quick load times, FreeOffice is a great option for casual word processing and spreadsheet design.
 
Depending on when you download, your download might help out others, too. A handful of times in the past — most recently, over the Christmas season in 2018 — SoftMaker has run a charity campaign in which the company donated €0.10 per download to charitable projects around the world.
