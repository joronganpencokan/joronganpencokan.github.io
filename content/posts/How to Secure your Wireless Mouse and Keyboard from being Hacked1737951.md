2. Update Your Device Firmware: Updating your device firmware to the latest version can help to overcome the vulnerabilities associated with earlier versions. Manufacturers regularly release software updates that are designed to patch security flaws and improve the overall performance of your device.

3. Use Strong Passwords: Always use strong passwords that are difficult to guess. Avoid using easily accessible information such as your name, date of birth, or other publicly available information.

4. Monitor Your Wireless Usage: Always keep an eye on your wireless connection by monitoring and reviewing the devices that are connected to your network. This can help you to identify unauthorized access by keeping an eye on your network activity.

5. Use Antivirus Software: Antivirus software is essential in protecting your device from malware such as spyware, adware, viruses, and trojans. Regular scans can identify and remove any malware that may have infected your device.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, wireless mice and keyboards have become integral parts of our daily lives, and it is important to be aware of the risks that come with using them. By following the above tips, you can significantly reduce the chances of being hacked or having your sensitive information compromised.
