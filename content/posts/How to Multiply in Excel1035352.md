Did you know that there is a life-changing Excel hack that can help you multiply any number in seconds? Yes, you read that right - no calculator needed! If you're tired of struggling with calculations and keystrokes, then this hack is just what you need. In this article, we'll explore this mind-blowing Excel trick and show you how to use it in just a few steps.

Step 1: Open up Microsoft Excel and create a new spreadsheet. Enter the two numbers you want to multiply into cells A1 and B1, respectively.

Step 2: In cell C1, type the following formula: '=A1*B1'. This is the multiplication formula which tells Excel to multiply the values in cells A1 and B1.

Step 3: Hit enter and watch as the answer to your multiplication problem appears in cell C1. It's really that easy!

This Excel hack works for any two numbers that you want to multiply. All you have to do is replace the values in cells A1 and B1 with the numbers you want to multiply. Excel will automatically calculate the result for you.

But wait, there's more! This hack also works for multiplying multiple numbers together. Let's say you want to multiply three numbers - all you need to do is add an additional cell with the value of the third number and modify the formula accordingly. For example, if you want to multiply the numbers 2, 3, and 4 together, you can enter them in cells A1, B1, and C1, respectively. In cell D1, you can type the formula '=A1*B1*C1' and hit enter. The result will appear in cell D1, giving you the answer of 24.

Not only does this Excel hack save you time by eliminating the need for a calculator, but it also helps you avoid making calculation errors. Excel does all the work for you, so you can be sure that your answer is accurate. Plus, you can easily edit the numbers in the cells to quickly recalculate the answer.

In conclusion, this mind-blowing Excel hack is an essential tool for anyone who works with numbers. It's easy to use, saves time, and produces accurate results. So the next time you're struggling with multiplication, remember that Excel has your back. All you need is a few clicks and you'll have your answer in seconds.

This article explains multiplication in Excel for versions 2019, 2016, 2013, 2010, Excel Online, and Excel for Mac.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Assuming rows in Col A, the basic formula is = A1*A2
 - Formulas in Excel begin with an equal sign ( = ), which goes in the cell where you want to display the answer.
 - The multiplication sign or operator used in Excel formulas is the asterisk ( * ) symbol.

 
##   Multiply Rows or Columns: Use Cell References in Formulas  
 

It's possible to enter numbers directly into a formula. But it's much better to enter the data into worksheet cells and then use the addresses or references of those cells in the formula.

 

The main advantage of using cell references in a formula, rather than the actual data, can be seen when the data in the cells is changed. When the actual data is used for the calculation, the formula needs to be rewritten. When using cell references, the results of the formula update automatically when the data in the target cells change.

 
##   Use Pointing to Enter Cell References  
 

It is possible to type the cell references to be used in the formula, but a better approach is to use pointing to add the cell references. Pointing involves selecting the target cells containing the data to add the cell reference to the formula. This minimizes the possibility of errors created by typing the wrong cell reference.

 
##   Multiplication Formula  
 

The example in the image above creates a formula in cell C1 that multiplies the data in cell A1 by the data in cell A2. The finished formula in cell E1 looks like: =A1*A2.

 

= A1 * A2

 
##   Type the Data  
 
- Type the number 10 in cell A1 and press Enter.
 - Type the number 20 in cell A2 and press Enter.

 
##   Create the Formula  
 
- Select cell C1 to make it the active cell. This is where the result of the formula will appear.
 - Type = (an equal sign) into cell C1.
 - Select cell A1 to enter that cell reference into the formula.
 - Type * (​an asterisk symbol) after cell A1.
 - Select cell A2 to enter that cell reference.
 - Press Enter to complete the formula. Cell C1 displays the result of 200.

 
##   Update the Formula Data  
 

To test the value of using cell references in a formula, change the number in cell A2 from 20 to 5 and press Enter. The answer in cell C1 automatically updates to 50 to reflect the change in data in cell A2.

 

Type the number 10 in cell A1 and press Enter.

 

Type the number 20 in cell A2 and press Enter.

 

Select cell C1 to make it the active cell. This is where the result of the formula will appear.

 

Type = (an equal sign) into cell C1.

 

Select cell A1 to enter that cell reference into the formula.

 

Type * (​an asterisk symbol) after cell A1.

 

Select cell A2 to enter that cell reference.

 

Press Enter to complete the formula. Cell C1 displays the result of 200.

 
##   Fix the Formula  
 

If it becomes necessary to correct or change a formula:

 
- Double-click the formula in the worksheet to place Excel in Edit mode and then make changes to the formula. This works best for minor changes.Select the cell containing the formula and rewrite the entire formula. This method is best for major changes.

 
##   Create More Complex Formulas  
 

To write more complex formulas that include multiple operations (such as subtraction, addition, and division, as well as multiplication), add the correct mathematical operators in the correct order followed by the cell references containing the data. For practice, try this step by step example of a more complex formula.

 
Before mixing different mathematical operations together in a formula, it is important to understand the order of operations that Excel follows when evaluating a formula.
