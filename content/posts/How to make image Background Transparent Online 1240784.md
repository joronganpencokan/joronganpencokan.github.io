# Unveil the Secret to Creating Professional-Looking Images with a Transparent Background at the Click of a Button!

As our lives go digital, we constantly encounter images with transparent backgrounds. These images look professional and can catch the eye of anyone who glances at them. But have you ever wondered how to create such images? Do you think it requires advanced technical know-how? Well, we hope to debunk that myth in this article. 

Thanks to image editing software such as Paint.net, Gimp, and Photoshop, you don't need to be a professional graphic designer to create images with a transparent background. In fact, with just a few clicks, you can convert an image that has an opaque background to one with a transparent background.

The secret to creating such images is knowing how to remove the background without leaving any traces of the image's surroundings. Here are some steps to get started:

## Step 1 - Open the image

The first step is to open the image in your chosen editing software. You can do this by uploading the image into the software or by copying and pasting it into a new document. 

## Step 2 - Select the Magic Wand tool

Next, select the "Magic Wand" tool. This is a tool that automatically selects a specific color or a group of colors in your image. It works by selecting adjacent pixels that have a similar color value to the one you clicked on.

## Step 3 - Adjust the tool settings

Once you've selected the Magic Wand tool, you'll need to adjust its settings. You can do this by tweaking its tolerance range, the color range that it selects, and its sensitivity. 

## Step 4 - Click on the background

With the tool settings adjusted, click on the parts of the image you want to remove (in this case, the background). This step removes the pixels that correspond with the clicked color values. The result is a transparent background. 

## Step 5 - Save the image 

Once you've removed the background, the image should now have a transparent background. Save the image by selecting "Save As" and choosing your preferred file format (e.g., PNG or GIF).

Congratulations! You now have a professional-looking image with a transparent background. 

## Some additional tips

- If the Magic Wand tool selects more pixels than you intended, you can use the "Eraser" tool to refine your selection. 
- Some images may require manual selection and erasing, such as those with complex backgrounds or those with hair. In such cases, take your time and be patient. 
- If you're not happy with the result, be sure to undo the changes before trying again.

In conclusion, creating images with transparent backgrounds doesn't have to be a daunting process. With the right tools and a bit of practice, you can create professional-looking images that catch the eye and help you stand out in the digital world. So, what are you waiting for? Try it out today!

If you know Photoshop you can do it right away. But those who are not aware of Photoshop or other image editing software, even they can also make image background transparent. Now many online websites provide you the hand to hand services where you can edit the image and make its background transparent with just a few clicks.
 
## Procedure To Make Image Background Transparent Online
 
We are taking two background burner websites to demonstrate how to remove background from image online. However, we have given links of multiple websites at the end of this article where you can visit and perform the same operation.

4) Under Wizards’ tab, look for Transparency tool and click on it.
 
5) Now simply click on the background area you want to make transparent, it will judge automatically. This image editing tool website works best for the area whose background is white.
6) After making the desired changes, click on the save button. The image will be saved in png format.
 
### Using Pixlr
 
Pixlr is another background eraser online tool. This photo editor is quite user-friendly where you have to use only one tool called wand tool to make the background of any image transparent, whether it is png or jpeg.
 
Let’s have a look at the steps.
 
1) Open Pixlr and import image by clicking File->Open Image and select the desired image.
 
2) Once the photo is imported, click on the wand tool available on the left panel as shown in the picture below.
 
3) Now click on the background area which you want to remove.
 
4) Next, click on the Edit at the top menu and select Invert selection option.
 
5) Again click on Edit and select Copy.
 
 
 
6) Click on File->New Image. A new dialog box appears where you need to check the Transparent option, by default it is unchecked, and click on Ok.
 
7) A new window will appear. Click on Edit and click on Paste option.
 
8) You will have the image with transparent background ready. It’s time to save the file with transparency.
 
9) Click on File->Save. A window will open where you need to select the image format. Choose PNG (Transparent, full quality) format and click on OK. Select the desired location on your system where you want to save the image. That’s it, you have the image ready.
 
NOTE: Always make sure that whenever you save the image, save it as png and not jpg or jpeg because only png image can have a transparent background. If you save the image as jpeg even through some image editing software then the transparent background will become white. And don’t open the image in Microsoft paint and then save, it will remove the transparency from the image.
 
This is how you can make image background transparent. There could be multiple ways to remove the background from an image like from Photoshop or other editing software, but this method is the easiest one and less time taking.
 
Below are the links of the two more websites where you can make the image background transparent.
