In today's technology-driven world, we spend more time staring at our screens than ever before. From working on laptops to scrolling through social media on our phones, our eyes are strained by the bright light emitted by our screens. However, managing screen brightness can make all the difference in reducing eye strain and improving productivity.

Here are some useful tips and tricks to help you unlock the secret to perfectly managing your screen brightness:

1. Adjust your screen brightness according to the environment
The brightness required in a well-lit room will differ from that required in a dimly lit room. If you are working in a brighter environment, increase your screen brightness to help reduce eye strain. Similarly, if you are working in a darker environment, decrease your screen brightness to avoid eye fatigue.

2. Use the night mode feature
Most modern devices now offer a night mode feature that reduces the blue light emitted by the screen. Blue light can disrupt our circadian rhythm, making it difficult for us to get quality sleep. By using the night mode, you can reduce the impact of blue light on your eyes and improve the quality of your sleep.

3. Adjust the color temperature of your screen
The color temperature of your screen has a significant impact on eye health. A warmer color temperature helps reduce eye strain, while a cooler temperature can lead to eye fatigue. Experiment with the color temperature settings on your device to find the perfect balance for your eyes.

4. Use an external monitor
If you work on a laptop for long periods, it can be challenging to get the screen at the ideal distance from your eyes. Investing in an external monitor can help you place the screen at the perfect distance, reducing eye fatigue and strain. An external monitor also offers more control over brightness and color temperature settings.

5. Take breaks
No matter how well you manage your screen brightness, it's crucial to take regular breaks to reduce eye strain. A simple rule is the 20-20-20 rule; after every 20 minutes spent staring at your screen, take a 20-seconds break by looking at something 20 feet away.

In conclusion, managing screen brightness is essential for improving productivity and reducing eye fatigue. Whether you work on a laptop, phone, or desktop, using these tips and tricks will help you unlock the secret to perfectly managing your screen brightness. Remember to take regular breaks and seek advice from an optometrist if you experience persistent eye strain or other eye-related issues.

If you tend to spend a lot of time looking at your screen, eye strain can be a problem. There is some scientific research saying long exposure to bright screens may even disrupt your sleep cycle. The default brightness app may not be enough for reducing or even eliminating the strain. But these apps can help. Here are the top apps to manage screen brightness on Android.
 
## Manage Screen Brightness
 
CF.Lumen
 
CF.Lumen is way ahead of any other screen brightness adjustment app. Unlike other apps that put a tinted overlay, it adjusts the colors of the screen by directly manipulating the gamma values. Moreover, if you choose to automatically adjust the brightness, the app does it according to your current location and time of the day. Options like Force sleep mode in dark or Force day mode in bright ambient light can help you adjust the brightness according to your need.
 
The Pro version of the app provides additional features such as quick toggle buttons and notifications. However, you can use all these pro features for free by selecting the Freeload settings. But it’s nice to throw some cash to support the developer. Get it from Google Play Store.
 
Lux
 
This is arguably one of the best brightness adjustment app for Android. the simple and minimal design will not overwhelm you. Lux offers 4 methods for auto-adjusting the backlight – Ascending, Dynamic, Periodic and On Wake. But if you want more flexibility, you can go ahead and manually adjust anything you want, including the maximum and minimum brightness and how quickly the backlight fades.
 
Sometimes Android’s minimum brightness is still way too bright, especially at night. Lux allows you to go sub-zero brightness. There’s a Pro version which adds features like using the camera to read the ambient light and much more. Find it on Google Play Store.
 
Velis
 
Velis is for those who find the settings on other heavy brightness management app underwhelming. This is a replacement for Android’s default brightness app. It may take some time to completely learn this app but the result is worthy. Velis gives you maximum control.
 
What makes this app stand apart is the graph it provides to read ambient light along the X-axis and screen brightness along the Y-axis. You have full control over the graph. You can make it change the brightness when on a certain ambient light. Download from Google Play Store.
 
Moreover, you can go below the minimum brightness levels and make the app not run when a certain app is running on foreground.
