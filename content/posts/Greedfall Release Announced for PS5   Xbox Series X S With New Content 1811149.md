GreedFall is an RPG that offers a range of character customization and development, equipment, and magic. In the game world, you will meet different factions and characters, each with their own motivation. The developers for the production of the title were inspired by the world of the 17th century – the Baroque era with its unique art, fashion, and architecture.
