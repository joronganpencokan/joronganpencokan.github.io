# Ps5 Gamers Beware: GTA Online Black Screens Could Ruin Your Gaming Experience – Here's How to Fix It!

If you're a fan of Grand Theft Auto or GTA, then you're probably familiar with GTA Online, the game's multiplayer component. With GTA Online, players can join together in various activities, including heists, races, and much more. However, for PlayStation 5 users, there's a problem with GTA Online that can potentially ruin their gaming experience – black screens. In this article, we'll explain what these black screens are and how you can fix them.

## What Are Black Screens in GTA Online?

Black screens refer to when the game suddenly goes black, and all you can see is your cursor in the middle of the screen. This issue typically occurs when you're loading into a game or transitioning between different activities. Unfortunately, many PS5 users have reported experiencing the problem, and it seems to be affecting several different activities in GTA Online.

## Why Do Black Screens Occur in GTA Online?

The main reason for black screens in GTA Online is a connection issue. If the connection to the server is disrupted, the game goes black, and you're unable to see what's happening in the game. There's no root cause of the issue, but it's believed that it could be related to the game's unstable servers and the high demand for resources.

## How to Fix Black Screens in GTA Online on PS5?

Below are some of the solutions you can try if you're experiencing black screens in GTA Online on your PS5:

### 1. Restart the Game

The first and simplest solution is to restart the game. This can help in case the issue is temporary, and the game will function correctly once restarted. To restart the game, close the game application and relaunch it from the menu.

### 2. Clear Your Cache

Another thing you can try is to clear the game's cache. This resets the game's memory and can sometimes fix any bugs or issues that may be causing black screens. To clear the cache, go to settings, select "storage," and then "clear cache."

### 3. Check Your Internet Connection

Ensure that your internet connection is working correctly. You can test your internet connection on your PS5 by navigating to settings, network, and checking your connection. Try resetting your router if the connection is unstable.

### 4. Upgrade Your Internet Service

If none of the above methods works for you, then you may need to upgrade your internet service. GTA Online requires a stable and fast internet connection to function correctly. Consider upgrading to a more robust internet connection to prevent connection issues.

## Conclusion

In summary, black screens in GTA Online can be infuriating for PS5 gamers. It's essential to fix the issue to have a seamless gaming experience. If none of the solutions above work, you should contact Rockstar Games customer support for assistance.

GTA 5’s next-gen release is here and if you are planning to get this upgrade, there might be a roadblock along the way. It’s the dreaded black screen which shows up while trying to migrate your account and character to GTA Online on PS5. Is there a fix or workaround for this issue?
 
## GTA Online Account Migration PS5 Black Screen Fix
 

 
Try the following steps if you get the black screen while migrating the account on PS5:
 
- Restart the game and try again.
 - Check if GTA servers are undergoing an outage.
 - Wait it out. Check out the Support Twitter account for updates – they will inform players when such issues are resolved.

 
Since players have spent years working on a character, they simply cannot afford to lose any progress. So, while doing this, if you see an alert with an error message that says – “Your GTA Online Profile is still being migrated. You will be returned to the Main Menu and will not be able to play GTA online until the migration is complete” – don’t worry. Your progress isn’t lost and you don’t have to start over. It’s a bug from Rockstar’s end and they have posted that it is now fixed, so please try again.
 
Make sure to avoid turning off the game while the migration is going on and ensure that your internet connection remains stable as well. In case you get stuck at a certain percentage, like 90%, restart the game again.
 
If GTA servers are overloaded, there’s nothing you can do other than wait. You might want to try again after a few hours and the migration should happen smoothly at that time.
 
One important thing to note is that once the migration is done, your GTA online save/progress can be accessed only from your PS5. It will be removed from your old-gen platforms. This means everything from your character progression, earnings, purchases, weapons and everything else stays in your PS5 and gets deleted from your older consoles.
 
Also if you were curious to know about the GTA online profile migration of PS4 and Xbox One accounts that were previously migrated to PC – then Rockstar Support has addressed it. The migration should work as intended now. But do keep in mind that GTA Online profiles on PC cannot be migrated to PS5 or Xbox Series X|S. For more info, you can check out @RockstarSupport.
