Exclusive! Windows 10 Build 16237: Discover the Top Secrets and Mind-Blowing Upgrades!

Windows 10 is one of the most popular operating systems in the world today. With every new update, Microsoft introduces new features and improvements to enhance the user experience. However, the latest build, Windows 10 Build 16237, is a game-changer.

Microsoft unveiled this new build on July 13, 2017, and promised it would include several features that would make Windows 10 even better. In this article, we will take a closer look at the top secrets and mind-blowing upgrades in Windows 10 Build 16237.

First on the list is the Windows 10 Game Mode. This feature improves the performance of your PC while playing games by allowing the CPU and GPU to prioritize the game. This will lead to faster game load times, better frame rates, and less stuttering. Simply turn on the Game Mode toggle in the Settings app under Gaming, and you're ready to go.

The second big feature is integrated Eye Control. This is a great accessibility feature for users with disabilities. Eye Control lets you control your mouse and keyboard with your eyes. You need to have a compatible eye-tracker device, but once you do, you can use your eyes to scroll, select, and type without touching the mouse or keyboard.

The third major feature is the new Start menu design. The design has been revamped with an all-new look, feel, and color scheme. The new design also includes Fluent Design System, which makes the UI more interactive and visually appealing.

The fourth major feature is called OneDrive Files On-Demand. It allows you to access your OneDrive files without downloading them. This feature is useful if you have a lot of files on your OneDrive account and don't want to take up space on your hard disk.

Other notable upgrades in Windows 10 Build 16237 include an improved Game Bar, more color options for the Command Prompt, improved LAN networking, and a new settings section for storage sense. Finally, there's a new look for Microsoft Edge's Hub, which includes a new wider reading mode for eBooks.

In conclusion, Windows 10 Build 16237 is one of the most impressive updates in recent times. It brings a host of new improvements and features that will make your Windows 10 experience better than ever before. Be sure to check it out as it is already available for download. And with these new features, we may be looking at the future of Windows!
