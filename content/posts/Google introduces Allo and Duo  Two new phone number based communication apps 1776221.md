Revolutionize Your Communication Game with Google's Latest Phone Number Based Apps - Meet Allo and Duo!

Communication has evolved over the years from letters, telegrams, telephones to mobile phones and instant messaging services. It's safe to say that we are living in an age where keeping in touch with each other has never been easier. With the advancement of technology and communication services, video calling and instant messaging have become the norm for staying connected with our friends and family.

Google, one of the leading technology companies, has unveiled two new phone number-based apps, Allo and Duo. These apps have been designed to enhance communication and take it to the next level by incorporating the latest features that are convenient and engaging.

Allo - The Enhanced Messaging App:
Allo is the latest messaging app launched by Google that utilizes phone numbers as the primary source of contact. This app is designed to improve communication by incorporating new features such as a Google Assistant, Smart Reply, Incognito mode, and more. Allo enables users to message each other seamlessly, send photos, and share locations, and information from Google search without leaving the app.

The Smart Reply feature of Allo is one of the most exciting additions to messaging platforms. It is an AI-powered feature that suggests suitable responses to your incoming messages. It's almost like having a conversation with a robot that can predict what you would say next.

Google Assistant is another exciting feature added to Allo. This feature acts as a virtual assistant to help you with almost everything you need, from setting up reminders to booking appointments. Allo also comes with a self-destruct feature, which is a security feature that allows users to set a timer for messages to disappear.

Duo - The Video Calling App:
Duo is a video calling app from Google that uses phone numbers as the primary source of contact. This app is designed to provide a seamless, high-quality video calling experience that's easy to use, and it's available on both iOS and Android platforms. Duo offers a feature called Knock Knock, which lets users see the incoming call video before answering the call.

Duo's interface is minimalist, and it's designed for simplicity, so it's easy to use even for those who are technologically challenged. The app also adapts to the available network and adjusts the video quality to ensure the best quality video output even when network connectivity is weak.

Conclusion:
Allo and Duo are Google's latest phone number-based apps that have been designed to enhance communication and make it more engaging and convenient. They offer exciting features that are not currently available on other messaging and video calling apps. The introduction of Smart Reply, Google Assistant, Incognito Mode, Knock Knock, and self-destruct features boast of the promise of Allo and Duo to take communication for users to the next level. With the ease of use, the availability of apps on both major platforms (iOS and Android), Google establishes its name once again as a market leader in the tech industry, and we can't wait to see what else they have in store for us in the future!

When we thought we had enough communications apps, Google unveils Allo and Duo. They are two separate apps: Allo is a smart messaging app that brings machine learning into the mix, and Duo is a simple video calling app with some unique features.
 
The company announced the two new apps during its I/O 2016 developer conference at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California.
 
## Google’s Allo messaging app
 
Allo is a new messaging app that aims to make conversation more interactive and fun. The app doesn’t require sign in with a Google account as it works with your phone number — Yes, just like Viber.
 
The Google messaging app also has a deep integration with machine learning, allowing the app to learn as you use it to help you have a faster and more engaging conversation.
 
Allo includes Smart Reply, which is a feature that will allow you to reply to a message with text suggestions based on the conversation you’re having. Also, the more you use the app the smarter it will get to suggest the best reply that you likely want to use.
 

 
Applying machine learning, you will even get reply suggestions when someone sends you a photo. For example, if you get a photo of a dog, you might get a reply suggestion reading “cute dog”.
 
Similar to Microsoft’s Bots that you will find on upcoming versions of Skype using Cortana, Allo features Google’s version of Bots, which the company simply refers to “Google assistant”.
 
Google assistant will be able to jump into your conversation suggesting useful information, and you can even do a one-on-one chat to get information, map directions, translations, make a restaurant reservation, cancel flights, or change your calendar.
 
And you don’t have to be specific either, you can ask things like “is my flight delayed?” and Google assistant will understand the context and give you the right answer.
 
Finally, Allo will also include an Incognito mode to chat privately with an end-to-end encryption and discreet notifications.
 
## Google’s Duo video calling app
 
Duo could be perhaps the next best video calling app you will use. You can only do one-on-one video calling, and it works on fast and slow connections.
 
Like Allo, Duo uses your phone number to make the connection, which means that you don’t have to sign in with a Google account.
 
One of the best features of Duo is Knock Knock, which shows you a preview video of the person who is calling before you decide to pick up. Once you swipe to answer the call, you’ll seamlessly transition to the call.
 
Duo feature high-quality video calling up to 720p and audio. The app uses adaptive bandwidth, which means that it will adapt and work in virtually any network. In other words, you will at least be able to connect.
 
Google has built Duo to be smart and seamlessly transmission between Wi-Fi and cellular networks without dropping the call. The Duo app also features end-to-end encryption for each communication.
 
Google said that these apps won’t be replacing the Hangouts app, they are just additional apps. Both Allo and Duo are still on development, the company plans to release them later this summer on Android and iOS (sorry, no Duo for Windows phones, but I think you’re expecting that). However, you can register to get early access to both — follow link 1 and link 2.
