Go Pro or Go Home: The Showdown Between GoPro and Dash Camera

When it comes to capturing our most thrilling and adventurous moments, it seems like GoPro is the ultimate choice. But, with the rise of dash cameras, are we forgetting about the technology that has been protecting us on the road for nearly a decade?

GoPro has been the leader in adventure cameras for years, providing high-quality video and photo footage from activities such as extreme sports, skydiving, surfing, and even diving. Their sleek and compact design, along with their waterproof capabilities, make it possible to capture incredible moments in almost any type of environment.

However, dash cameras have been on the scene since the early 2010s, providing drivers with a way to record their time on the road. With features such as loop recording, motion detection, and collision detection, dash cameras have been helping to protect drivers from scams, accidents, and even police misconduct.

But now, the question is, with the ever-increasing trend of GoPro cameras and the versatility they offer, is it worth investing in a separate dash cam?

While GoPro cameras are great for capturing extreme sports and activities, they may not be the best option for capturing everyday commutes or accidents. Dash cameras are specifically designed to capture footage while driving, making them more efficient and reliable in the event of an accident or incident.

Additionally, dash cameras are often equipped with features such as GPS tracking and speed alerts, which can help drivers keep track of their speed and location, making it easier to spot dangerous areas on the road.

On the other hand, GoPro cameras are incredibly versatile and can be used in almost any setting. They offer high-quality video and photo capabilities, along with a variety of mounts and accessories that make it possible to capture unique and interesting footage.

Ultimately, the decision between GoPro and dash cameras comes down to personal preference and what type of footage you are looking to capture. If you are someone who enjoys extreme sports and adventure, then investing in a GoPro may be the way to go. However, if you are someone who spends a lot of time on the road or wants to protect themselves in the event of an accident, then a dash camera is the better option.

In conclusion, both GoPro and dash cameras have their advantages and disadvantages. It is important to consider your specific needs and preferences when deciding which one to invest in. Whether it's capturing your daily commute or your latest adventure, there's a camera out there for everyone. So, Go Pro or Go Home? The choice is yours.

A GoPro camera is great for capturing extreme sports and activities. It isn't an ideal alternative to a dedicated dash camera. A dashcam sits in your car and continuously records your drives, serving as a witness in a traffic accident. There are other purposes, but the continuous, always-on functionality of a dashcam presents technological demands that GoPro cameras don't meet.

 
##   Overall Findings  
 

GoPro cameras are generally more expensive than dashcams and aren't designed to sit indefinitely in a vehicle. These devices can't be set to turn on and start recording when the car is started, and lack hardware to protect against extreme cold or extreme heat. If you use a GoPro as a dashcam, you must mount it on the dash, plug it in, and turn it on every time you drive.

 
- Not as convenient as a dashcam, but will do the job.
 - Generally more expensive than dashcams.
 - Must be brought with you and turned on every time you drive.

 
- Ideal for monitoring traffic for security and insurance purposes.
 - Generally cheaper than GoPro cameras.
 - Turns on and records automatically. Don't need to bring it with you or turn it on before drives.

 
##   Convenience: With Dashcams, You Can Set It and Forget It  
 

Because dashcams turn on and record automatically, you won't worry about forgetting to bring it with you or neglecting to turn it on, as you would with a GoPro.

 
- Must be brought with you and turned on every time you drive.
 - Not as durable or resistant to extreme temperatures.

 
- Turns on and records automatically. Don't need to bring it with you or turn it on before drives.

 

Unlike a smartphone app or a GoPro, which you would presumably take with you, dashcams are dedicated devices. Dashcams sit on the dashboard at all times. This affords a set it and forget it appeal. Once a dashcam is installed, it begins recording as soon as you start the car.

 
##   Features: Both Offer a Suite of Useful Tools  
 

Dash cameras are designed for vehicles and often come with designs and features that make driving easier. Some come with built-in GPS and shock sensors. With GPS, a dashcam records exactly where you were and how you were moving when an accident occurs. Shock sensors allow dashcams to activate or mark a looped recording when the vehicle experiences a sudden change in acceleration.

 
- No intelligent parking mode to record while you're away from the vehicle.
 - Looped recording allows you to maintain storage space, as new recordings replace older ones.
 - Some models include GPS and shock sensors.

 
- Many include built-in GPS and shock sensors.
 - Some have intelligent parking mode, for continued recording while away from the vehicle.
 - Looped recording allows you to maintain storage space, as new recordings replace older ones.

 

You can find many of these features on many GoPros and some dashcam apps, as most have accelerometers, GPS navigation, and waterproof housing. Carrying your phone around with you is likely more intuitive and easier to remember than a GoPro.

 

While dashcams may be more convenient due to the automated functionality, both dashcams and GoPros offer looped recording. The camera automatically replaces old video files when there isn't any storage space left. This functionality is a prerequisite for any dashboard surveillance solution. Without it, you would fill up memory and storage space in a short time.

 

If you use a GoPro as a dashcam, you'll need to turn on the looped recording feature and place the GoPro in a skeleton housing or mount. Unlike the waterproof housing, a skeleton housing allows you to power the camera while it's in use. You'll need a 12 volt USB adapter or a 12-volt charger with a micro USB connector to plug the GoPro into a cigarette lighter or accessory socket.

 

After you activate looped recording and put your GoPro in a skeleton housing, you can mount it to a dash or windshield. The main drawback is that you must turn it on every time you drive.

 
##   Value: Dashcams Are Cheaper, Unless You Own a GoPro  
 

GoPro cameras are recognizable consumer gadgets. Vehicles with an expensive GoPro on the dashboard likely face a greater risk of theft than a generic dashcam.

 
- Must be brought with you and turned on every time you drive.
 - Generally more expensive than dashcams.
 - Not as durable or resistant to extreme temperatures.

 
- Generally cheaper than GoPro cameras.
 - Losing a dashcam isn't as troublesome as losing a GoPro.

 

Dashcams are usually, but not always, built to be more resilient than GoPros, because dashcams must endure the extreme hot and cold temperature swings of a car.

 

While most dashcams record automatically, dashcam apps have many of the same problems that GoPro cameras do. You need to carry a device with you and turn it on before each drive. The convenience of automated functionality adds value.

 
##   Final Verdict: For Driving Purposes, Stick With a Dashcam  
 

If you rely on a GoPro for outdoor hobbies and other activities, and want a cheap way to monitor your driving, use your GoPro as a dashcam. If you don't own a GoPro and only want to record your driving, a dashcam is the way to go.

 

The value and convenience of a dedicated dashcam make it more suited for vehicle and traffic monitoring than a GoPro. The automated functionality is an argument in its favor. However, with a full range of prices and feature sets, there's really no competition.
