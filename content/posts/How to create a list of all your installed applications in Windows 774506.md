Title: Are You Getting the Most Out of Your Windows? Learn the Super-Easy Hack to List All Your Installed Apps Now!

Introduction:

Are you aware of all the apps installed on your Windows device? At times, it's difficult to keep track of which apps are installed and which ones need to be uninstalled for better performance. Fortunately, Windows has a simple but powerful hack that enables users to list all their installed apps in one go. In this article, we'll explore this hack and learn how you can get the most out of your Windows.

Body:

Step 1: Open the Run Dialog Box

The first step towards listing all the installed apps on your Windows PC is to open the "Run" dialog box. You can do this by pressing the "Windows Key" + "R" on your keyboard. Alternatively, you can search for the "Run" application by typing it in the Windows search bar.

Step 2: Enter the Command

Once the Run dialog box appears, type in "appwiz.cpl" and press Enter. This command will open the "Programs and Features" window, which contains a complete list of all the apps installed on your PC. The list will also include the publisher name, size, and date of installation for each app.

Step 3: Filter Out the Apps

If you're looking for a particular app, you can use the search bar at the top right corner of the window to filter out the apps. For instance, if you're looking for the Microsoft Office suite, type "Microsoft Office" in the search bar, and all the related apps will appear in the list.

Step 4: Uninstall Unwanted Apps

If you notice any apps that you don't need, you can uninstall them by clicking on the app and selecting "Uninstall/Change." This action will remove the app and all its files from your PC, freeing up some space and improving your computer's performance.

Step 5: Update Installed Apps

Finally, it's crucial to keep all your installed apps up to date to ensure they have the latest features and security updates. You can check for the app updates by clicking on the app and selecting "Modernize." You can also manually update the apps by visiting the publisher's website or using the Windows Store.

Conclusion:

Listing all the installed apps in Windows is super-easy, and it's a simple but essential hack to ensure you're getting the most out of your Windows PC. It's especially crucial to keep your installed apps up to date and remove the ones you don't need to optimize your computer's performance. So, the next time you want to check which apps are installed on your Windows PC, remember to use this super-easy hack.
