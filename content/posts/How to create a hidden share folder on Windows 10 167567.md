# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Create A Secret Folder On Windows 10!

If you're someone like me, privacy and security are your top concerns when it comes to using your computer. Whether it's storing sensitive files or simply having a personal space to store files, a secret folder on Windows 10 can come in handy. In this article, we'll discuss how to create a secret folder on Windows 10 in just a few easy steps.

## Step 1: Create a New Folder

The first thing you need to do is create a new folder somewhere on your computer. To do this, right-click on your desktop or inside a file explorer window and select "New Folder." Give your folder a unique name that won't draw attention to it, such as "Backup" or "System Files."

## Step 2: Rename the Folder to be Hidden

Now that you've created your new folder, it's time to make it disappear from plain sight. Right-click on the folder and select "Renam e." While the cursor is in the text box, press and hold the Alt key, then type "0160" using the number pad on your keyboard. This will produce a blank space in the folder's name. Hit Enter to save the name change.

## Step 3: Hide the Folder

It's time to make your secret folder truly secret by hiding it from view. Right-click on the folder and select "Properties." In the Properties window, under the General tab, check the box next to "Hidden." Click "Apply" to save your changes. The folder is now hidden from view.

## Step 4: Access the Folder

To access your secret folder, you'll need to reveal it. Open a file explorer window and select "View" from the top menu. Check the box next to "Hidden Items" in the "Show/Hide" section. Your secret folder will now reappear in its hidden state.

## Step 5: Add Files to the Folder

Now that you've created and hidden your secret folder, you can start adding files to it. Simply drag and drop any files you want to keep hidden into the folder, and they'll be safely stored away.

### Conclusion

Creating a secret folder on Windows 10 is easy and can add an extra layer of security to your computer. By simply renaming and hiding a folder, you can keep your sensitive files away from prying eyes. Remember to keep your folder's name inconspicuous and to reveal it only when necessary. With these steps, you can enjoy a little extra peace of mind when it comes to your computer's security.
