Is Your Chrome Browser Safe? Here's The Ultimate Guide To Boost Security And Keep Hackers Out!

Chrome, the widely used web browser, has become a favorite among users around the world. It's fast, efficient, and provides seamless browsing. However, with every technology advancement come security risks. Google Chrome is no exception, and it may not be as safe as you think. With hackers using increasingly sophisticated methods to gain access to user data, it's essential to ensure that your Chrome browser is secure. In this article, we're going to take a look at some ways to boost your Chrome browser's security and keep hackers out.

Use The Latest Version Of Chrome

The first step in securing your Chrome browser is to make sure you're using the latest version. Chrome frequently releases new versions that fix bugs and security issues, and it's crucial to stay updated to benefit from these improvements. To check if your browser is up to date, click on the three dots in the top right corner and select Help > About Google Chrome. This will give you information about your browser version and whether any updates are available.

Install Security Extensions

Chrome has an extensive library of extensions designed to increase security while browsing. Some of these extensions include Adblock Plus, HTTPS Everywhere, and Privacy Badger. These tools help prevent unauthorized access to your data and protect against malware and phishing attempts. By adding security extensions to your Chrome browser, you're adding an extra layer of security to your browsing experience.

Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication is a security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to your account. It requires you to enter a code sent to your phone or email address before accessing your account, making it much more difficult for hackers to gain access to your data. Two-factor authentication is available on most popular websites, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter. Make sure to enable two-factor authentication on all websites that offer it to help protect your account from unauthorized access.

Use Strong Passwords

One of the most basic but effective ways of securing your Chrome browser is to use strong passwords. Having a strong password is essential in preventing unauthorized access to your account. Hackers often use password cracking techniques to guess weak passwords, and if successful, they can gain access to your data. Make sure to use a strong password with a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols, and avoid using easily guessable information such as your name, date of birth, or pet's name.

Be Wary Of Phishing Attempts

Phishing is a technique used by hackers to steal your personal information through fake websites or emails that look legitimate. Be cautious when clicking on links or opening attachments from unknown sources. Keep an eye out for warning signs such as misspelled words, suspicious email addresses, and unusual requests for personal information. If you're unsure about the authenticity of an email or website, don't enter any private information and contact the website or company directly to verify the request.

In conclusion, securing your Chrome browser is essential for protecting your personal and sensitive information from hackers. By following the tips mentioned above, you can help prevent unauthorized access to your account and stay safe while browsing the internet. Always make sure to stay up to date with the latest Chrome updates, use strong passwords, and enable any available security features. Remember, staying cautious and aware of potential threats is the key to keeping your Chrome browser safe.

We talk a lot about security on Make Tech Easier. Whether you’re securing FireFox or using a browser dedicated to privacy, we understand the importance of security in our connected, digital world. If you’re a user of Google Chrome, you may be neglecting your browser security.
 
The web browser is the primary way that most users interact with the Internet, and it’s perhaps the largest vector of attack that can be used by viruses, malware and malicious third parties. Having proper browser security is important, now more than ever, especially if you’re managing things like PayPal accounts and bank details.
 
Fortunately for you, there are a few ways to increase the security of your Chrome browser. Why else would we be here if there weren’t?
 
## Privacy Extensions (Easy)
 

 
Chief among the ways of making Google Chrome have better security is installing extensions that enhance your privacy and Internet security. The easiest one would be HTTPS Everywhere which you may recognize from my previous FireFox security article. That article is worth mentioning, too, since a lot of the things you can do to secure your installation of FireFox can also be done on Chrome.
 
The extensions from that article include:
 
- Disconnect – An extension that allows you to block sites that track you across the web. In addition to privacy, this speeds up your Internet connection significantly.
 - uBlock Origin – An adblocker that’s better than AdBlock Plus. What more do you need?
 - Web of Trust – Rates websites based on worldwide community feedback. Fishy websites will be flagged on Web of Trust, so keeping an eye on Web of Trust ratings is a simple, easy way to make sure you’re browsing safe, no matter where you go.

 
Here are a few more, for good measure.
 
- Secure Profile. – Your Chrome installation stores all kinds of userdata by default, including a huge list of passwords that can be accessed by anyone who knows the password to your computer. To add an extra layer of protection to your stored passwords, use this extension.
 - Credit Card Nanny. – Not every site will treat your credit card info properly. Credit Card Nanny will tell you if a site is doing something it shouldn’t with your secure payment information.

 
## Using a VPN Service (Advanced)
 
Here’s what many people consider to be a nuclear option. Want full browser security? Use a VPN! A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, encrypts and routes all your data through external, secure servers so that no one – not your ISP, not the NSA – knows what you’re doing with your Internet connection.
 
The best VPNs are paid and can be applied across your whole computer – these include Private Internet Access and NordVPN.
 
However, there are free VPN browser solutions. Looking among the available Chrome options, the two most highly-rated and used are Hola’s Unlimited Free VPN and DotVPN. Unlimited Free VPN is great for circumventing content blocks, but its usage as an actual full VPN client may be up for debaate. Meanwhile, DotVPN is great, when it works, but sometimes it doesn’t, according to reviews.
 
## Google’s End-To-End Initiative (Difficult)
 
The NSA security scandal was and is a big deal, especially for the big tech companies who were revealed to be vulnerable during that incident. Despite Google’s reputation as an advertiser, Google actually cares quite a bit about security and privacy of its user data. That’s why it’s been working on securing the Internet lately. They push for proper encryption on all websites using the HTTPS standard. Google isn’t alone; a lot of tech and web companies are on the search giant’s side here.
 
In order to support this, Google is developing an end-to-end extension designed to encrypt all web traffic done through its Chrome browser. At the time of writing (Feb 2016), this project isn’t yet done and likely has many bugs. An alpha version of the extension is on github, and it’ll be in development for a while.
 
Overall, what you do with your browser is up to you. Using the options I’ve given you above, however, you should find that your browsing data is more secure than ever! Just be sure to stay away from suspicious sites, and take care of security and maintenance on the rest of your computer.
