# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Brew the Most Mind-Blowing Mundane Potion In Minecraft!

Minecraft is a game that has something to offer to everyone. One of the things that make Minecraft so unique is its crafting system. From weapons to potions, the possibilities are endless when it comes to crafting. In this article, we will discuss one of the most overlooked and underrated potions in Minecraft - the Mundane Potion. 

First off, what is a Mundane Potion? In simple terms, it's a potion that doesn't add any effects to the player. It's a potion that's just there. You might think, "Why bother learning how to make a potion that's so useless?". And that's where you're wrong. Creating a Mundane Potion is simple and can actually be quite useful in certain scenarios. For example, if you accidentally add the wrong ingredient to a potion recipe, the result will be a Mundane Potion. Knowing how to make Mundane Potions can save you a lot of resources and disappointment in the long run. 

Now, let's talk about how to make a Mundane Potion. To create a Mundane Potion, you only need one Water Bottle and any ingredient that doesn't have any effect on a potion. Here's a complete list of all the ingredients that can be used to make a Mundane Potion: 

* Nether Wart
* Spider Eye
* Fermented Spider Eye
* Sugar
* Rabbit's Foot
* Blaze Powder
* Magma Cream
* Ghast Tear
* Phantom Membrane

Simply combine the Water Bottle with any one of these ingredients in a Brewing Stand, and you will get a Mundane Potion. That's it. No complicated recipes or difficult steps. Just add any ingredient listed above to a Water Bottle, and voila! You have a Mundane Potion. 

Now, you might be thinking, "Okay, I made a Mundane Potion. Now what?". Well, there are a few things you can do with a Mundane Potion. For starters, you can use it to extend the duration of other potions. For example, if you add a Mundane Potion to a Potion of Night Vision, the duration of the potion will be extended. 

Another use for Mundane Potions is in creating Splash Potions. Splash Potions are potions that can be thrown, affecting all players or mobs in the area of impact. Adding a Mundane Potion to a Splash Potion will create a Splash Mundane Potion that does not have any effects. This type of potion can be useful for identifying targets in a group of players or mobs. 

In conclusion, making a Mundane Potion in Minecraft is incredibly easy, and it can come in handy in a variety of situations. Whether you're looking to extend the duration of other potions or creating Splash Mundane Potions, knowing how to make a Mundane Potion is a must for any Minecraft player. So go ahead and try it out! You won't believe how easy it is.
