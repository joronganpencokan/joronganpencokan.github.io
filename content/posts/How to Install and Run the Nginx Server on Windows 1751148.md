# Unlock the Secret to Lightning Fast Website Speed: Learn How to Install and Run Nginx Server on Windows Like a Pro!

Are you tired of slow website loading times? Do you want to improve your website's performance and create a better user experience?

One of the best ways to achieve lightning-fast website speeds is to install and run an Nginx server on Windows. In this article, we will guide you through the steps to install and configure Nginx on your Windows machine like a pro.

## What is Nginx?

Nginx (pronounced "engine X") is a lightweight, open-source web server software that can also act as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. It was designed with high concurrency in mind and is favored by large-scale websites and high-traffic web applications.

## Why use Nginx?

There are several reasons why using Nginx can benefit your website's speed and performance:

* High concurrency: Nginx is designed to handle high levels of concurrent connections and requests, making it perform exceptionally well under heavy load.

* Lightweight and fast: Compared to other web servers, Nginx is exceptionally lightweight, which means it requires fewer resources to run and is faster overall.

* Reverse proxy: Nginx can act as a reverse proxy, meaning it can handle requests from clients and forward them to other servers, improving response time and reducing server load.

## Installing Nginx on Windows

Before we start, make sure that you have administrator access on your Windows machine. Also, ensure that you have Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86) installed on your system as Nginx requires it to run.

### Step 1: Download Nginx

The first step is to download the latest version of Nginx for Windows from the official Nginx download page. You can either choose the pre-compiled binary version or the source code version, depending on your preference.

### Step 2: Extract Nginx

Extract the downloaded Nginx zip file into a folder of your choice, for example, `C:\nginx`.

### Step 3: Edit the Nginx Configuration File

To configure Nginx, you need to edit the `nginx.conf` file in the `conf` folder of the extracted Nginx folder. Here are some parameters that you can tweak to optimize Nginx for performance:

* worker_processes: This parameter sets the number of worker processes that Nginx should use. A good rule of thumb is to set this to the number of CPU cores in your system.

* worker_connections: This parameter sets the maximum number of connections that each worker process can handle simultaneously. A good value for this parameter is 1024 or 2048.

* sendfile: This parameter determines whether Nginx should use the `sendfile()` system call to send files to clients. Set this to `on` to enable this feature, as it can significantly improve file transfer speeds.

### Step 4: Start Nginx

To start Nginx, open a command prompt and navigate to the `nginx` directory using the `cd` command. Then run the following command:

```
start nginx
```

This will start the Nginx server in the background. To stop Nginx, run the following command:

```
nginx -s stop
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can install and configure Nginx on your Windows machine like a pro. With Nginx running, you can expect lightning-fast website speeds and a better user experience for your visitors. So why wait? Give it a try today and see the difference for yourself!

Nginx is a web server that is very popular with Linux and BSD systems. It can also be installed on Windows 10. However, there are a few performance limitations in Windows that have not been mitigated so far, but the developers will address these problems in a future release. To install and run Nginx successfully on Windows, follow the steps below.
 
## Download the Nginx Server
 
There are many download versions of Nginx for Windows, and Nginx recommends using the “mainline version.” However, you will not find any issues if you download its most recent stable version for Windows.
 
Select the version you want and download its zip file to your PC.
 
As a first step, you need to extract the new folder. You can use 7-zip, WinRAR or any other popular compression software.
 
After extracting the file contents in the original folder, you have to move the entire folder that came with the built-in download copy into the “Program Files.” We can either move or cut-paste this extracted folder.
 
We will run Nginx from this location as a default web service program.
 
## Installing Nginx
 
To install and run Nginx, select and double-click the Nginx.exe file. It has now been activated for further use. You may run into a Windows Defender block screen while running the Nginx server, which has to be allowed by you.
 
In the next step, you need to verify whether the installation has been successful. For this, go to your default browser and type localhost. Microsoft Edge is the browser used in the below example. If you see a screen saying the Nginx web server is successfully installed and working, it means there were no problems with your Nginx installation in Windows.
 
To stop Nginx, you can end it from the Task Manager window.
 
## Running Nginx on Your Windows PC
 
To run Nginx, you have to use Internet Information Services (IIS), which is a Microsoft web server that serves requested HTML pages or files. You can enable it in “Turn Windows Features On or Off” in the Control Panel. Check the required fields for “Web Management Tools” and “IIS Management Console.”
 
It will take a while for IIS to be enabled on your computer as the changes are applied.
 
You can open IIS Manager directly from the Start menu. Always open it in Administrator mode.
 
Here, you will be able to access the default website, which is usually located at “inetpub wwwroot.” This is also known as the web application root. You can look for it in File Explorer through a simple search.
 
It is helpful to change the physical path of this root to a more desirable folder. I created a new “Work” folder in C:\ and changed the physical path to “C:\Work.” When you double-click on the “default web site” option in IIS Manager, it should lead to this new folder. Alternatively, you can right-click the menu and select “explore” for the same result.
 
After this, go to the Nginx folder that you renamed in the Program files. Click “Conf” and select “nginx.conf.” This file can be edited using the Notepad++ text editor, but you can use any other editor such as Atom or Visual Studio Code. 
 
In Notepad++, find the location of the root and change it from the default html.
 
As shown here, change the root to the edited physical path which we discussed above.
 
You can edit the index.html file in the root folder in a separate tab. Change the text to what you want the web server to display on the screen.
 
Exit the Nginx.exe program using “End Task.” Open and run the “nginx.exe” file in Admin mode. 
 
Type localhost in a browser window. The Nginx web server will highlight the edits you made.
 
## Example Application of Nginx in Windows 
 
The Nginx resources site has a full list of web server applications which you can use to run various applications on Windows PC. 
 
For example, you can use Nginx in Windows to link to a webpage such as a customer login page. Once you make the configuration changes in the “nginx.conf” file, your end users will be able to access the login page on their end. 
 
Go back to the “nginx.conf” file shared in the previous section. Instead of “localhost,” you need a domain name for the server to access. “index.html” is a command used to point to any static html page. 
 
In the next step, go to “location” and modify the text using an “api,” followed by a proxy server added with an “http” ping. This should point to any login page you want this page to direct to. 
 
Save the file and run the “Nginx.exe” program in Admin mode. For this login page to look nice to the end user, you should have previously configured the web server in an IDE program like Eclipse.
 
## Frequently Asked Questions
 
### 1. What are the basic commands in operating Nginx for Windows 10?
 
On Windows, Nginx can be run as a standard console app. For managing it, the following simple commands are frequently used:
 
### 2. What is the role of IIS Webserver in Nginx applications in Windows?
 
IIS is Microsoft’s native web server which supports HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, and other protocols, and is not enabled in Windows as default. When Nginx is installed in Windows, it handles the live traffic based on changes made in nginx.conf files. For this, Nginx has to connect internally to an enabled IIS and then cache its response for any future requests. 
 
Nginx’s biggest strength is that it is used at the front end before high load dynamic sites. Imagine tens of thousands of your website users downloading an important video file from IIS at the same time. It can become painfully slow. if you have a very powerful front-end server like Nginx handling the traffic instead, the request is processed faster. Check the “running Nginx on Windows PC” section for more details on IIS webserver’s role.
 
### 3.How Does Nginx Run in Windows?
 
Nginx supports multiple applications in Windows, such as web server, load balancer, mail proxy, and more. To run them in Windows, all desired changes are affected from various strings modified in the “nginx.conf” file in the Windows installation folder.
