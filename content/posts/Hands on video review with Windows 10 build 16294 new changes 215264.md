Windows 10 has recently released its new build 16294, and it comes with some fantastic new features that promise to provide users with a better computing experience. Here's a comprehensive review of its mind-blowing new features that you won't believe.

### 1. Fluent Design

The Fluent Design System is a set of guidelines that help app developers design new apps for Windows 10. This system is all about transparency, blurring the lines between the foreground and background, and adding depth to the interface. Microsoft has added various new components such as Acrylic, Reveal, and Fluent Animation to the design language to make it more interactive and immersive.

### 2. Timeline

Another fantastic new feature of Windows 10 Build 16294 is the Timeline. If you're multitasking and working on multiple applications, Timeline will help you keep track of everything. This feature acts as a visual timeline of your recently used documents, apps, and files. With this feature, you can quickly jump back to what you were working on earlier.

### 3. Cortana and Edge Improvements

The new build of Windows 10 has also improved Cortana and Microsoft Edge. Cortana, Microsoft's virtual assistant, can now access all critical documents and files from your PC's search result. It means that you don't have to open the file explorer to find your files. Additionally, Edge now supports EPUB files, making it an excellent tool for readers.

### 4. OneDrive Files On-Demand

OneDrive Files On-Demand is one of the most significant additions to Windows 10 Build 16294. If you are using OneDrive, you can now access all your files, no matter where they are stored, without having to download them. This means you can save a lot of space on your hard drive and use it for other things.

### 5. Other Improvements

Apart from the features mentioned above, Windows 10 Build 16294 comes with various other improvements such as MyPeople enhancements, better Eye Control, enhanced parental control, and much more.
