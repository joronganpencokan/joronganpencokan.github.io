# Unleash Your Inner Assassin with This Proven Hitman 3 Icarus Guide - Become the Dubai's Ultimate Hitman!

Are you ready to become the ultimate hitman in Dubai? Hitman 3's Icarus mission has some unique challenges that require stealth and quick thinking. With this proven guide, you can unleash your inner assassin and become a master of the game.

## Planning

Before you jump into the Icarus mission, you need to plan your approach. Look at the map and identify the areas that you need to infiltrate. There are two main targets in the mission, Marcus Stuyvesant and Carl Ingram. You need to take them out and escape without being detected.

## Disguises

Disguises are key in Hitman 3. They allow you to blend in and move around the level without arousing suspicion. In the Icarus mission, there are several options for disguises. You can dress up as a waiter, security guard or maintenance crew.

## Weapons

Choosing the right weapon is crucial in Hitman 3. You want to have a weapon that is silent and deadly. The silenced pistol and fiber wire are great options for the Icarus mission. They allow you to take out your targets silently without alerting other guards.

## Starting Location

The starting location can give you a big advantage in the Icarus mission. There are several options available depending on the level of difficulty you choose. If you want to start off with a good disguise, choose the Staff Entrance starting location. This will allow you to blend in with the staff and move around undetected.

## Infiltrating

Once you have your plan in place, it's time to infiltrate the areas where your targets are located. Remember to move slowly and use cover to hide from guards. Take out any guards who may be blocking your path, but do so silently.

## Taking Out Your Targets

Taking out your targets is the main objective of the Icarus mission. You can take them out in a variety of ways, but be careful not to get caught. The easiest option is to poison their drinks and wait for them to fall unconscious. Then, take them out with your chosen weapon.

## Escape

Once you have taken out your targets, it's time to escape. The easiest way to do this is to go back the way you came. Remember to switch disguises if you need to and move quickly. The guards will be on high alert after your targets have been taken out.

## Conclusion

Becoming the ultimate hitman in Dubai requires planning, quick thinking and stealth. With this proven Hitman 3 Icarus guide, you can take on the challenges of the Icarus mission and come out on top. Remember to choose your disguises and weapons carefully, infiltrate slowly and take out your targets silently. Good luck, assassin!

Hitman 3 has a staggering number of Assassination challenges on the Dubai level that players will have to complete throughout the game. One such assassination challenge is Icarus. Unlike other missions in Hitman 3, Icarus is quite easy because it does not require players to get any disguise and have powerful weapons in their inventory to get it completed.
 
## How to Complete Hitman 3 Icarus on Dubai
 
If you want to complete Hitman 3 Icarus on Dubai instantly, I highly recommend unlocking the art installation starting point first. If you do as we said, you will be able to complete this challenge in no time. If you don’t do as we said, Marcus Stuyvesant will leave the art exhibit.
 
As soon as you start the art installation, on level 2, the first thing you should do is to find a crowbar, which can be found on the left side of the platform. To obtain the Crowbar, you will have to distract the Tech guys.
 
Once you have successfully acquired the Crowbar, you will have to locate a fusebox in the same room. Once found, break the fusebox with your crowbar and grab the fuse. Now, you will have to go back to the art installation starting point and then climb up the ladder.
 
When you reach the top of the ladder, you will find an open fusebox on the right side. Now, you will need to put the fuse that you just grabbed. After inserting the fuse, you will have to go down via the same ladder and interact with the safety override terminal for the sun art.
 

 
Now, you will have to wait until Stuyvesant appears and interact with the terminal. As soon as he appears and stretches out his arms in front of the sun, you can override the safe zone. Doing this will electrocute Marcus Stuyvesant and a prompt should pop up on the screen saying that you have completed the Hitman 3 Icarus assassination challenge on Dubai.
 
That’s everything you need to know about how to finish Hitman 3 Icarus on Dubai objective in Hitman 3. While here, ensure reading about how to complete Mile Hight Drop in Dubai and where to find Greenhouse Key In Dartmoor In Hitman 3.
