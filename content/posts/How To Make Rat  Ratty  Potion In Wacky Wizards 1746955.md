If you want to make the Rat Potion in Wacky Wizards, you will need to know the ingredients and the recipe for it. Look no further because we’ve got you covered. Once you brew this potion, you can go ahead and become a Rat and roam around the map.
 
## Wacky Wizards Rat Potion Recipe and Ingredients Guide
 

 
To make the Rat Potion in Wacky Wizards, you need the Witches Brew ingredient and Spider. The Spider is a free ingredient and can be obtained without much effort. But for Witches Brew, you have to complete a short questline which has a few tasks involved.
 
You can obtain the Witches Brew item by completing the Witches Quest first. We’ve covered all the steps of the guide, so be sure to check it out to get the item locations fast. Basically, you have to talk to Glinda the Witch and fulfill her requests. Don’t worry, the items she wants are easy to find. Once you have the ingredient, then you can go ahead and get the Spider item.
 
To get Spider, you have to head to the cave with the Spider web at the entrance. Yes, as you can tell, it is very obvious. You can enter the cave easily but to reach the Spider, you have to actually make yourself smaller by using a Tiny Potion. Players can brew it with the Fairy in the Cauldron and spawn the potion immediately. Head back to the cave with the Potion in hand and drink it at the small entrance to get the Spider.
 
So, with the ingredients obtained, put the Witches Brew and Spider in the Cauldron and click on the Ratty potion. Drink it and you will change into a Rat. Easy-peasy!
 
That’s all about this potion. We’ve got the entire potions, recipes and ingredients list that you can check out to know everything available right now. And for everything else, head over to our Wacky Wizards guides.
