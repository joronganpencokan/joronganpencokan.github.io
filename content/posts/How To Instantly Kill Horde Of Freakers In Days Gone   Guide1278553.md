Days Gone has been an incredibly popular game since its release, and for good reason. It offers players an immersive and thrilling experience in a post-apocalyptic world filled with infected "Freakers". But as fun as the game is, there is no denying that quickly taking down hordes of Freakers can be a bit of a challenge. Luckily, there is an ultimate hack that can help you annihilate them in a matter of minutes!

Are you ready to take your gameplay to the next level? Then read on to unlock the ultimate hack to defeat endless hordes of Freakers.

## Equip Your Character Well

One of the keys to effectively defeating hordes of Freakers is to make sure that your character is equipped with the right gear. You will want to make sure that you are wearing armor that has a high resistance to damage, along with a weapon that deals a lot of damage per second. We recommend the Chicago Chopper as it has the highest rate of fire and damage output.

## Plan Your Attack

The next step is to plan your attack. You will want to approach the horde from a direction that gives you an advantage. Take note of the surrounding area and try to find chokepoints or other obstacles that you can use to funnel the horde into a smaller space.

## Take Advantage of Traps

Now that you have your character equipped and have a plan of attack, it's time to take advantage of traps. There are a variety of traps in the game that you can use to slow down the horde and deal extra damage. Setting traps like grenade traps, proximity mines, and molotovs can help you take down clusters of Freakers at once.

## Use Your Ultimate Ability

Don't forget to use your ultimate ability. It's a game-changer and can help you take down multiple Freakers at once. The ultimate ability of Deacon, the protagonist, provides him with a temporary boost in speed, damage, and health for a short time, making him almost invincible.

## Watch Your Surroundings

Last but not least, it's important to be aware of your surroundings. Keep an eye out for any obstacles or traps that may hinder your progress, and always be aware of your character's health and stamina levels. If you find yourself getting overwhelmed, consider retreating and regrouping before attempting the horde again.

By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to annihilating endless hordes of Freakers in Days Gone. Remember to equip your character well, plan your attack, take advantage of traps, use your ultimate ability, and watch your surroundings. With this ultimate hack, your gameplay is about to change forever!

Days Gone will be tough, especially dealing with the horde of Freakers it would be not easy to get away from the death trap. Once you are tracked the entire group follows you, and this will be a pain. There are traps, weapons, and throwables in the game to tackle the zombies, but what can work well to help you?
 
The answer is to understand how throwables works and what they offer before you blindly plant a trap that can explode or use all your grenades or Molotov. Weapons are best when you have a good spot to stand and the Freakers cannot catch you instantly, while on roads or open ground the Freakers are really fast.
 
The best way to tackle a bunch of zombies to use fire. Freakers caught in fire slows down and they look confused. For while they will hold up their attacks, Molotov is the best throwable. There is a beer bottle, RAG, Kerosene also in the throwable section.
 
If you have enough Molotov throw them on the path of Freakers, instead of throwing on one. Anyone who walks through that will catch fire and slow down and they also die with one bullet while burning. Weaker ones will die instantly, the fire damages a lot.
 
So remember that Molotov or anything that can cause fire can reduce Freakers Health, even if they are in a group. Try to find enough items to craft Molotov and use them as a important backup plan if you get surrounded.
