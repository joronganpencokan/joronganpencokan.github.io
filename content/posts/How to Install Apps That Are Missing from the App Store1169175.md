# Unlock a Secret World of Apps: Learn How to Install Missing Apps on Your iPhone!

As an iPhone user, you may have encountered a frustrating moment when you tried to download an app from the App Store, only to find out that it's not available in your location. Or worse, you may have accidentally deleted a pre-installed app that you now desperately need.

But did you know that there is a way to install missing apps on your iPhone, even if they're not officially available in your country, or have been removed from the App Store? That's right, by using a technique called "sideloading," you can unlock a secret world of apps that are not accessible through the traditional app distribution channels.

In this article, we'll guide you through the process of sideloading apps on your iPhone, and show you how to safely and securely install third-party apps on your device. So buckle up, and get ready to discover a whole new world of possibilities!

## What is sideloading, and why is it useful?

Before we dive into the technical details, let's first define what sideloading means. In essence, sideloading refers to the act of installing an app on your device from a source other than the official App Store. This can be done by downloading the app directly from the developer's website, or by using a third-party app store.

Sideloading can be useful for a number of reasons. Firstly, it can help you access apps that are not available in your region, either because they haven't been released yet, or because of regional restrictions. For example, if you're a fan of Japanese anime and games, you may want to install some Japanese apps that are not available in your country.

Secondly, sideloading allows you to install apps that have been removed from the App Store, either by the developer or by Apple itself. This can be particularly useful if you've accidentally deleted a pre-installed app that you need, or if you want to use an app that Apple has banned for some reason.

Finally, sideloading can give you access to apps that offer features that are not allowed by Apple's strict App Store guidelines. For example, you may want to use an app that lets you download videos from YouTube, or an ad-blocking app that blocks ads in all apps, not just Safari.

## Is sideloading safe?

Now, you may be wondering, is sideloading safe? After all, if you're installing apps from unknown sources, you could be exposing your device to malware, viruses, and other security threats.

The good news is, sideloading can be perfectly safe, as long as you take some precautions. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

- Only download apps from trusted sources, such as the developer's official website, or a reputable third-party app store.
- Check the app's reviews and ratings before you download it, to make sure it's legitimate and doesn't have any major issues.
- Use an antivirus app to scan any apps you download, to detect any potential threats.
- Make sure your iPhone is running the latest version of iOS, and that you regularly update your apps and security settings.

## How to sideload an app on your iPhone

Okay, now that we've covered the basics, let's get to the fun part: how to sideload an app on your iPhone. There are several ways to do this, but we'll focus on two of the most popular methods: using a third-party app store, and using a computer.

### Method 1: Using a third-party app store

The easiest way to sideload apps on your iPhone is to use a third-party app store. Here are the steps:

1. Install a third-party app store on your iPhone. Some popular options include TweakBox, AppValley, and TutuApp. To install one of these app stores, simply go to the developer's website on your iPhone, and follow the instructions to download and install the app.

2. Open the app store, and browse for the app you want to install. The app should be listed under the category of "Tweaked" or "Modified."

3. Tap the app's icon, and tap the "Install" button to begin the installation process.

4. Wait for the app to download and install on your iPhone. Depending on the size of the app, this may take a few minutes.

5. Once the app is installed, you should be able to open it and use it like any other app on your iPhone. If you encounter any issues, try restarting your iPhone or reinstalling the app.

### Method 2: Using a computer

If you prefer a more hands-on approach, you can also sideload apps on your iPhone using a computer. Here's how:

1. Download and install the Cydia Impactor app on your computer. This app allows you to install apps on your iPhone using your Apple ID.

2. Download the IPA file for the app you want to install. The IPA file is the installation package for the app, and can usually be found on the developer's website.

3. Connect your iPhone to your computer using a USB cable.

4. Open Cydia Impactor, and drag the IPA file onto the app's window.

5. Enter your Apple ID and password, and click the "Start" button to begin the installation process.

6. Wait for the app to install on your iPhone. Once the installation is complete, go to your iPhone's Settings app, and navigate to General > Profiles & Device Management. Find the profile for the app you just installed, and tap "Trust" to enable it.

7. You should now be able to open the app and use it like any other app on your iPhone. If you encounter any issues, try restarting your iPhone or reinstalling the app.

## Final thoughts: Test the waters and be cautious

Sideloading apps on your iPhone can be a powerful way to expand your app options and access new features. However, it also comes with some risks, such as exposing your device to security threats or downloading apps that don't work as expected.

As with any new technology, it's important to test the waters and be cautious. Start by sideloading a few low-risk apps, and use trusted sources to download them. If you're not sure whether an app is safe, do some research and read reviews from other users.

Sideloading apps can be a bit of a rabbit hole, but once you unlock that secret world of apps, you may never want to go back to the traditional App Store. So go ahead, try it out, and see what you've been missing!

Sometimes an app that shouldn't be allowed into the App Store slips through and is available for a few hours or days before it's removed. If you got one of those apps before it was removed from the store, you can still use it, and in this guide we show you how to do so on any iOS device.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Two ways to download an app that's not on the App Store: From a friend who has it, or a backup. Both require an older version of iTunes.Friend's device: Go to the folder with the app. Copy it to the cloud or removable storage media. Drag to iTunes and sync with iOS device.iTunes: Sync your iOS device with iTunes by going to File > Devices > Transfer Purchases.

 
##   How to Install an App Removed from the App Store  
 

If you downloaded the app on your iOS device, you may still be able to install it. Since the app has been removed from the store, you won't be able to re-download it, though. If you delete the app, it's gone forever—unless you have a friend with the app or you backed it up with an older version of iTunes.

 
###   Get the App From Someone You Know  
 

If a friend or a family member has the app on their computer, you might be able to get it from them. They need to navigate through their hard drive to the folder where that their apps are stored.

 
Apple removed the ability to sync apps to iOS from recent versions of iTunes. If your version of iTunes doesn't support app syncing anymore, this may be more trouble than its worth. You can downgrade to older versions of iTunes, but that's a slightly complex process and has wider implications. You may prefer just to live without the app you're trying to install.
 

On a Mac, this folder is at Music > iTunes > iTunes Media > Mobile Applications.

 

On Windows, it's located at My Music > iTunes > iTunes Media > Mobile Applications.

 
- Find the app you want. It can be emailed, or copied onto a USB drive or other removable storage media, or downloaded. Wherever you get the app from, drag and drop it into iTunes or into the Mobile Applications folder on your hard drive.
 - If the app doesn't show up right away, quit and restart iTunes.
 - Connect your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad and sync it.

 
###   Sync Apps Through iTunes  
 

You can back up a copy to your computer by syncing. When you sync your device, you'll be prompted to transfer purchases from the device to your computer. You can also do this manually by going to iTunes and clicking: File > Devices > Transfer Purchases. This should move the app to your computer.

 
Apps removed from the App Store can't be accessed via Family Sharing.

##   The Biggest Obstacle to Installing Apps Removed from the App Store  
 

Installing apps missing from the App Store has gotten much harder in the last few years and, for the average person, is now very difficult. It got harder because Apple removed downloading and managing apps from iTunes.

 
If you have an older version of iTunes that has the Apps tab, click the iPhone icon under the playback controls in the top left of iTunes. Go to the Apps tab and look for the app. Click the Install button next to it. Then click Apply in the bottom right to install it on your iOS device.
 

Because that feature is no longer present, the only way to officially install apps is through the App Store app. And, since the app you want isn't there anymore, you're kind of stuck. Jailbreaking and sideloading may help get around this problem, but they may be more trouble than it's worth.

 
##   Reasons Why Apps Are Removed from the App Store  
 

Apple doesn't (usually) pull apps from the App Store without good reason. Some of the most common reasons that apps get pulled include:

 
There's another major obstacle to installing apps removed from the App Store: you need access to the app. If you want to install a removed app you don't already have, you'll have to find it elsewhere.
 
- Violating Apple's rules for how you can develop apps or how apps can function.Infringing copyright.Being very low quality.Promoting illegal, potentially illegal, or dangerous behavior.Containing malware.Being offensive.Allowing the user to do something that Apple doesn't want (such as apps that allow free tethering, which let the user bypass purchasing tethering service from their phone carrier).

 
##   Does Apple Refund The Price of Removed Apps?  
 

If an app you purchased has been pulled and you don't want to go through the hassle of installing it detailed above, you may want a refund. Apple generally doesn't like to give app refunds, but it will under certain circumstances.

 - Why was Flappy Bird removed from the App Store?
