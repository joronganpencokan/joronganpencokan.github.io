Are you tired of spending hours rearranging pages in Word documents? Do you feel like there must be a simpler way to organize your content? Well, look no further because we have some easy tips that will make rearranging pages a breeze.

First, let's talk about the most straightforward method: the drag-and-drop feature. This feature allows you to drag a page from one spot to another quickly. To use this feature, simply click on the page you want to move, hold down your mouse button, and drag the page to its new location. The best part is that you can drag multiple pages at once!

Another helpful tip is to use the Navigation Pane. This feature allows you to see a thumbnail of each page in your document, making it easier to move them around. To use the Navigation Pane, go to the View tab, click on Navigation Pane, and select Thumbnails.

Now that you can see all your pages, rearranging them is a simple matter of dragging and dropping each page in its new location in the Navigation Pane. You can also delete or copy a page by right-clicking it in the Navigation Pane and selecting the desired option.

If you have a larger document with multiple sections, you may want to use the Page Thumbnails feature. This feature allows you to see every page's thumbnail in each section of your document, making it easier to move pages within and between sections. To use this feature, go to the Page Layout tab, click on Page Thumbnails, and select the section you want to view.

Finally, the last tip we have for you is using the Page Break feature to split up content into different sections. By splitting up your content, you can easily move pages within a section or between different sections. To insert a Page Break, go to the Insert tab, click on Page Break, and select the type of Page Break you want to use.

In conclusion, there are multiple ways to rearrange pages in Word, from simple drag-and-drop to advanced functions like the Navigation Pane and Page Thumbnails. By using these tips and tricks, you will save time and effort when organizing content within your documents. Give them a try and see how easy rearranging pages in Word can be!

This article includes instructions on moving pages in Microsoft Word 2019, 2016, and Office 365 using the Navigation pane and copy and paste.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Add headings to each page, then select the text > Home > Heading 1. Then, go to the last line of each page and click Insert > Page Break.Open the navigation pane and click and drag the headings to move the pages in the order you want them.You can also use cut and paste to rearrange pages, but it's much more tedious.

 
##   How To Set up the Navigation Pane To Rearrange Pages  
 

Microsoft Word doesn't see a document as a collection of separate pages but as one long page. Because of this, rearranging Word docs can be complicated. One of the easier ways to move pages in Word is by using the Navigation pane.

 
- Open the Microsoft Word document you want to rearrange. At the top of the first page, create a hard return by pressing Enter on the keyboard.
 - Type the information you want to use to indicate each page in the document. In this example, that information is Page [number].
 - You can use any text that makes sense to you, because you'll probably remove it later, so if you prefer headings that are relevant to the text on the page, use that. The one thing you probably don't want to do is use the exact same text on each page since that will make it difficult to tell in the Navigation pane what page is what when you start rearranging things.
 - Next, select the text and click Home.
 - In the Styles selector, select Heading 1.
 - Next, go to the bottom of the page and place your cursor at the end of the last line (or at the end of the last full sentence) and click Insert.
 - From the Insert ribbon select Page Break. This creates a clean page that can be easily moved from the Navigation pane.
 - Repeat that process for each page in your document.

 
##   How To Rearrange Pages in Word With the Navigation Pane  
 

Once all your pages are ready, then you can begin to move them around in your Word document until they are in the order you prefer.

 
To rearrange your pages in the Navigation Pane, you have to place a heading on each page of your document using Microsoft Styles.
 

Open the Microsoft Word document you want to rearrange. At the top of the first page, create a hard return by pressing Enter on the keyboard.

 

Type the information you want to use to indicate each page in the document. In this example, that information is Page [number].

 
You can use any text that makes sense to you, because you'll probably remove it later, so if you prefer headings that are relevant to the text on the page, use that. The one thing you probably don't want to do is use the exact same text on each page since that will make it difficult to tell in the Navigation pane what page is what when you start rearranging things.
 

Next, select the text and click Home.

 

In the Styles selector, select Heading 1.

 

Next, go to the bottom of the page and place your cursor at the end of the last line (or at the end of the last full sentence) and click Insert.

 

From the Insert ribbon select Page Break. This creates a clean page that can be easily moved from the Navigation pane.

 

Repeat that process for each page in your document.

 
- If it's not already open, you'll need to open the Navigation pane in your document. To do that click View.
 - On the View ribbon, make sure there is a tick in the box next to Navigation Pane. If there is not, click the option to select it.
 - The Navigation pane should appear on the left side of your screen. There, you can click and drag any of the headings that are shown.
 - As you drag a heading, you'll notice a dark blue line appears below each heading as you drag past it. If you release the heading at that point, it will be moved to the location of the dark blue line.
 - As the pages are moved, the document in the main Editing Pane will also move around and the text you moved (which should be the text of the entire page) will be highlighted. You'll also see the headings in the Navigation Pane in the new order.

 
##   Tips for Changing the Page Order Using the Navigation Pane  
 

Moving pages around in Word is easy with the Navigation pane as long as there are headings in the document. If what you're after is to move sections of a document, you can do that as well as long as there is a heading structure in your document.

 

If it's not already open, you'll need to open the Navigation pane in your document. To do that click View.

 

On the View ribbon, make sure there is a tick in the box next to Navigation Pane. If there is not, click the option to select it.

 

The Navigation pane should appear on the left side of your screen. There, you can click and drag any of the headings that are shown.

 

As you drag a heading, you'll notice a dark blue line appears below each heading as you drag past it. If you release the heading at that point, it will be moved to the location of the dark blue line.

 

As the pages are moved, the document in the main Editing Pane will also move around and the text you moved (which should be the text of the entire page) will be highlighted. You'll also see the headings in the Navigation Pane in the new order.

 

For example, if you already have a multi-page document that you've used any level headings in when you enable the Navigation pane, that structure will appear. You can then click and drag the headings and only the text under that heading will be moved.

 

One thing to keep in mind, however, is if you're moving a section that uses lower-level headings, the lower level headings will move along with the top-level heading. So if you have a section with Heading 1, two Heading 2s, and a Heading 3, the Heading 2s and Heading 3s will move along with the Heading 1.

 
##   Moving Pages in Word with Cut & Paste Actions  
 

Another way that you can move pages in your document is to cut & paste the text from one location to another. To do this, highlight the text you want to move, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + X to cut it, and then move your cursor to the place you want the text moved to in the document and use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + V.

 
Although Microsoft Word has some very well-designed styles that include multiple levels of headings, you can create your own styles with heading designations and use those as well.
 

Cut & Paste in Word is a fast way to move small amounts of text around a document, but if you're trying to move sections that are pages long, using the heading structure and Navigation pane is a much faster (and easier) way to rearrange your document.
