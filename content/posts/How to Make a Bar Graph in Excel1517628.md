# Discover The Hidden Tricks To Creating Stunning Bar Graphs In Excel - Boost Your Data Visualization Skills Today!

Data visualization is a crucial component of data analysis and presentation. Graphs and charts are essential tools for presenting complex information in a simple and visually appealing way. Bar graphs, in particular, are great for comparing values between different categories.  

Excel is one of the most widely used tools for creating graphs, including bar graphs. If you want to elevate your data visualization skills and create stunning bar graphs in Excel, read on to discover some hidden tricks.

## The Basics of Creating Bar Graphs

Before diving into the hidden tricks, let’s go through the basics of creating bar graphs in Excel. Here’s a quick step-by-step guide:

1. Enter your data into an Excel spreadsheet, with each category in a column and its corresponding value in the adjacent column.
2. Highlight the cells that you want to include in the graph.
3. Click on the ‘Insert’ tab and choose ‘Bar Chart’ from the available chart types.
4. Select the specific type of bar graph you want to create (clustered, stacked, etc.).
5. Customize the chart as desired, such as adding titles, legends, and axis labels.

That’s it – you now have a basic bar graph in Excel. But to make your bar graph stand out, here are some hidden tricks to elevate your data visualization skills.

## Hidden Tricks to Creating Stunning Bar Graphs

### Use Conditional Formatting to Highlight Specific Data Points

Excel’s conditional formatting feature is a great way to highlight certain values in your data. For example, if you want to emphasize the highest value in a bar graph, you can use conditional formatting to automatically color that bar differently. Here’s how:

1. Highlight the data range you want to format.
2. Click on the ‘Home’ tab and choose ‘Conditional Formatting’ from the ‘Styles’ group.
3. Select ‘Highlight Cells Rules’ and choose ‘Top/Bottom Rules’ from the drop-down menu.
4. Choose ‘Top 10 Items’ or ‘Top 10%’ and select the formatting you want to apply, such as a different color or font.

### Add Data Labels for Clarity

Data labels are a helpful way to easily identify each bar in a graph. You can add data labels to display the actual value of each bar, or you can add custom labels that help explain the data. Here’s how:

1. Click on the bar graph to select it.
2. Click on the ‘Chart Elements’ button in the top right corner of the chart.
3. Check the box next to ‘Data Labels’.
4. Choose which type of data labels you want to add, such as ‘Value’ or ‘Category Name’.

### Highlight Specific Categories with Error Bars

Error bars are lines that extend from each bar in a graph and represent the variability or uncertainty of the data. You can use error bars to highlight specific categories in your bar graph, making them stand out. Here’s how:

1. Click on the bar graph to select it.
2. Click on the ‘Chart Elements’ button in the top right corner of the chart.
3. Check the box next to ‘Error Bars’.
4. Choose which type of error bars you want to add, such as ‘Standard Error’ or ‘Custom’.
5. Customize the error bars as desired, such as changing the line color or thickness.

## Conclusion

Creating stunning bar graphs in Excel can help elevate your data visualization skills and make your presentations more engaging. By using Excel’s hidden tricks, such as conditional formatting, data labels, and error bars, you can create bar graphs that stand out and effectively communicate your data. So the next time you need to create a bar graph in Excel, try these tricks out and see the difference for yourself!

##   How to Make a Bar Graph in Excel  
 

When you make a bar chart in Microsoft Excel, it lets you do things like compare data over time, visually track progress, and many other useful things. There are different types of bar graphs you can customize in Excel, but the simplest kind is a bar chart comparing values for individual rows in Excel.

 

Here's how to make a bar graph in Excel.

 
- To make a bar graph, highlight the cells you want to graph. Make sure to include both the Labels and the Values, as well as the Header.
 - Next, select the Insert menu. Under the Charts group in the menu, select the dropdown next to the Bar Charts icon.
 - In Excel 2010 and Excel 2010, the icons in the Chart section of the ribbon, and the list of graph may look different. However you can find 2-D Bar and 3-D Bar in all Excel versions under this list.
 - At the bottom of this list, click on More Column Charts. In the pop-up window, select Bar from the left pane. Here you'll see 6 bar charts to choose from.
 - Clustered Bar: Each selected label has an individual bar that visually displays the value.Stacked Bar: Individual label values are stacked on top of one another in a single bar.100% Stacked Bar: Individual label values are stacked on top of one another to represent the percentage of the total sum for each label.3-D Clustered Bar: Same as clustered but bars are 3-dimensional.3-D Stacked Bar: Same as stacked bar but bars are 3-dimensional.3-D 100% Stacked Bar: Same as 100% stacked bar but bars are 3-dimensional.
 - When you click OK, the chart will appear in the spreadsheet. Initially, every bar will have the same color. To modify the appearance of the bar graph and vary the bar colors by data series, right-click one of the bars and select Format Data Series. In the Format Data Series pane, select the Fill & Line icon (paint can) and under Fill select Vary colors by point.
 - You can edit the title simply by selecting the Graph title and re-typing a new one.
 - You can modify the formatting of any area of the graph, like the plot area or the graph area, by right clicking and selecting the Format option.
 - When you're done creating the bar graph in Excel, you can update the labels or data at any time. You'll see those changes reflected automatically in the bar graph.

 
##   Compare Data With a Bar Graph in Excel  
 

You can also compare data in columns by using a clustered bar graph in Excel. This is a great way to identify trends over time for multiple items.

 

To make a bar graph, highlight the cells you want to graph. Make sure to include both the Labels and the Values, as well as the Header.

 

Next, select the Insert menu. Under the Charts group in the menu, select the dropdown next to the Bar Charts icon.

 
In Excel 2010 and Excel 2010, the icons in the Chart section of the ribbon, and the list of graph may look different. However you can find 2-D Bar and 3-D Bar in all Excel versions under this list.
 

At the bottom of this list, click on More Column Charts. In the pop-up window, select Bar from the left pane. Here you'll see 6 bar charts to choose from.

 
- Clustered Bar: Each selected label has an individual bar that visually displays the value.Stacked Bar: Individual label values are stacked on top of one another in a single bar.100% Stacked Bar: Individual label values are stacked on top of one another to represent the percentage of the total sum for each label.3-D Clustered Bar: Same as clustered but bars are 3-dimensional.3-D Stacked Bar: Same as stacked bar but bars are 3-dimensional.3-D 100% Stacked Bar: Same as 100% stacked bar but bars are 3-dimensional.

 

When you click OK, the chart will appear in the spreadsheet. Initially, every bar will have the same color. To modify the appearance of the bar graph and vary the bar colors by data series, right-click one of the bars and select Format Data Series. In the Format Data Series pane, select the Fill & Line icon (paint can) and under Fill select Vary colors by point.

 

You can edit the title simply by selecting the Graph title and re-typing a new one.

 

You can modify the formatting of any area of the graph, like the plot area or the graph area, by right clicking and selecting the Format option.

 
When you're done creating the bar graph in Excel, you can update the labels or data at any time. You'll see those changes reflected automatically in the bar graph.
 

For example, if a teacher wants to follow a students grade averages each month, the teacher can use a spreadsheet with multiple columns for each month.

 

The procedure below will produce a comparison chart with multiple clustered bars for each label over time.

 
- To build a Clustered Chart, select all the data in your spreadsheet. Make sure to include all Labels, all columns of data, and all Headers.
 - Select Title from the menu and in the Charts section of the ribbon, select the Bar Charts icon. In the drop-down menu, select either the 2D Bar or 3D Bar clustered chart.
 - This will place the clustered graph in your Excel spreadsheet. You'll notice that for each student's name, a bar of a different color represents each column. The column header shows up at the bottom of the chart to identify what each color represents.
 - Similar to other chart types, you can restyle or modify elements of the graph by right clicking and selecting Format. You can change Colors, Borders, and more.

 
##   Add New Columns to Existing Bar Graph  
 

You aren't stuck with the data you used to originally make your bar graph in Excel. You can add additional columns of data after the graph is in the spreadsheet.

 

To build a Clustered Chart, select all the data in your spreadsheet. Make sure to include all Labels, all columns of data, and all Headers.

 

Select Title from the menu and in the Charts section of the ribbon, select the Bar Charts icon. In the drop-down menu, select either the 2D Bar or 3D Bar clustered chart.

Similar to other chart types, you can restyle or modify elements of the graph by right clicking and selecting Format. You can change Colors, Borders, and more.

 
- To do this, select the bar graph and the cells the graph contains will highlight. Hold the mouse over the lower right corner of the group of cells (that just highlighted) and drag it to the right over the additional column of data.
 - When you're done, you'll see a third bar added to every cluster in the bar graph.
 - This means you're not stuck with fixed data when you make a bar graph in Excel. Add data however often you need to and the graph will update automatically.
