# Unstoppable Brigitte No More: Master The Best Hero Picks To Counter Her In Overwatch 2!

Brigitte, the ironclad support hero in Overwatch, has been a force to be reckoned with since her introduction to the game. Her armor pack can give any hero a fighting chance in a brawl, while her flail can stun and knockback enemies, making her a hard hero to take down. However, with the upcoming release of Overwatch 2, there are a few new hero additions that can help counter Brigitte's power.

Here are some of the best hero picks to counter Brigitte in Overwatch 2.

## Ashe

Ashe, the wild west gunslinger, can counter Brigitte's close-range attacks with her long-range rifle. Ashe's Dynamite skill can also inflict a burn over time effect on Brigitte, making her vulnerable to long-range snipers, such as Widowmaker and Hanzo.

## Junkrat

Junkrat, the explosive hero, is a good choice to pick up when dealing with Brigitte's shield. By lobbing grenades over the shield and using his mine, Junkrat can quickly and easily dispatch Brigitte.

## McCree

With his Deadeye ultimate, McCree can quickly take out Brigitte, even if she's hiding behind her shield. Combined with flashbang, McCree can stun Brigitte and eliminate her in seconds.

## Pharah

Pharah, the rocket launcher-wielding hero, can launch rockets over Brigitte's shield, making it challenging for her to continue to shield her team. Her mobility also makes her difficult for Brigitte to hit with her flail.

## Reaper

Reaper, the deadly close-quarters hero, has a kit that can easily take down Brigitte. With the ability to teleport, Reaper can get behind Brigitte's shield and inflict massive damage.

## Sombra

Sombra, the master hacker, can hack Brigitte, rendering her shield and abilities useless. With her stealth ability, Sombra can also sneak behind Brigitte and eliminate her before she has a chance to respond.

## Tracer

Tracer, the speedy hero with the ability to blink and recall, can dance around Brigitte with ease. Her pulse bomb ultimate can also inflict massive damage on Brigitte, taking out her armor as well.

In conclusion, there are a lot of hero choices that can help counter Brigitte's power in Overwatch 2. Knowing how to counter her and having the right hero pick can be the key to victory. So keep experimenting with different heroes and find your ultimate counter to Brigitte!
