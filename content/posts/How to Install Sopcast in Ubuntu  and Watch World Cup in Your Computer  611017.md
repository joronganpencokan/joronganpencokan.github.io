That’s it. You should be able to find the Sopcast Player in Applications -> Sound & Video. 
 
## Configure Firefox
 
To configure your Firefox to open “sop://” link automatically in Sopcast Player:
 
1. Type about:config in the address bar.
 
2. Click the button “I’ll be careful, I promise!”
 
3. Right click anywhere on the screen and select “New -> String”
 

 
4. Enter “network.protocol-handler.app.sop” (without the quote) in the preferences name
 
5. Enter “/usr/bin/sopcast-player” as the value.
 
6. If you are using Firefox 3.6 and above, you need to change the value of “network.protocol-handler.expose-all” to “false”
 
Now, when you click on the sop:// link, a window will open and prompt you for the application to open the link. Navigate to /usr/bin/sopcast-player. remember to check the box “remember my choice for sop link”.
 
Whenever you open a sopcast link, it will automatically open in sopcast player.
