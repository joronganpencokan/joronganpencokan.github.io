# Unlock The Ultimate Huawei Mate 30 Pro Hack: How To Install Google Play Services In Just Minutes!


The Huawei Mate 30 Pro is one of the most remarkable smartphone devices that has been launched this year. Its superior features have captured the attention of smartphone enthusiasts worldwide. However, the device does not come with Google Play Services pre-installed – a feature that is integral to most smartphone devices. If you recently purchased the Huawei Mate 30 Pro and are wondering how to install Google Play Services, you’ve come to the right place. Here’s how you can do it in just a few minutes.

## What Are Google Play Services?

Google Play Services is the suite of software applications that come pre-installed on every Google Android device. They provide access to a variety of Google services, including Google Play Store and Google Assistant. Huawei Mate 30 Pro comes with the company’s own mobile services, which are great but are not as comprehensive as Google’s offerings.

## Why Do You Need To Install Google Play Services?

The Huawei Mate 30 Pro offers a range of features and exceptional performance that make it stand out in the market. However, not having Google Play Services can limit your phone’s functionality, including installing and using apps from the Google Play Store. This is a significant limitation, especially for those who use their smartphones for work, socializing, or entertainment.

## How To Install Google Play Services In Just Minutes?

The process of installing Google Play Services on Huawei Mate 30 Pro is relatively easy and does not require any technical expertise. Follow these simple steps to do it in just a few minutes:

**Step 1: Download the required files**

Download the Google Installer APK and Google Play Services APK from a trusted source. These files enable you to install Google Play Store, Google Play Services, and other Google applications on your Huawei Mate 30 Pro.

**Step 2: Enable “Install From Unknown Sources”**

To install the downloaded files, go to “Settings” and then to “Security and Privacy.” Here, you will find the “Unknown Sources” option. Turn it on to allow installations from unknown sources on your device.

**Step 3: Install Google Installer APK**

Now, use a file manager to locate the downloaded Google Installer APK file on your device (usually in the “Download” folder). Once you find it, tap on the file to start the installation process.

**Step 4: Install Google Play Services APK**

After installing Google Installer APK, locate the “Google Play Services” APK from the “Download” folder. Install it using the same process as above.

**Step 5: Install Google Play Store**

After installing Google Play Services APK, you can now install the Google Play Store using the Google Installer App. Locate it in the “Download” folder, and install it using the same process. 

## Conclusion

It allows you to enjoy a plethora of features and applications that come with Google’s excellent suite of software applications. Follow the above simple steps, and you can install Google Play Services on your Huawei Mate 30 Pro in just a few minutes, without needing any technical expertise.
