## The Basics: Types of Bullet Points

Before we dive into the keyboard shortcuts, let's take a moment to examine the different types of bullet points you might encounter. These include:

Depending on your needs, you might use one or several of these types of bullet points in your documents. The good news is that the keyboard shortcuts we'll be discussing can be used to create any of these types!

## The Shortcuts: How to Create Bullet Points on Your Keyboard

Now, let's get to the fun part: the keyboard shortcuts themselves! Below, we'll provide step-by-step instructions for creating bullet points using a PC keyboard, a Mac keyboard, and a mobile device.

### PC Keyboard

To create a bullet point on a PC keyboard, follow these simple steps:

1. Click where you want the bullet point to appear in your document.
2. Press the "Alt" key and "7" on the numeric keypad at the same time (if you don't have a numeric keypad, use the numbers at the top of your keyboard instead).
3. Voila! You should see a solid circle bullet point appear on your screen.

If you want a hollow bullet point, simply use "Alt" + "9" instead.

### Mac Keyboard

On a Mac keyboard, you can create bullet points using the following steps:

1. Click where you want the bullet point to appear.
2. Press "Option" + "8" at the same time.
3. A solid circle bullet point should appear on your screen.

To create a hollow bullet point, use "Option" + "7" instead.

### Mobile Devices

Creating bullet points on a mobile device might seem trickier, but it's actually quite simple. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your document in your preferred app (e.g., Google Docs, Microsoft Word, etc.).
2. Tap where you want the bullet point to appear.
3. Locate the symbol or emoji keyboard on your device (this will vary depending on your device and operating system).
4. Choose the bullet point icon from the list (it might look like a solid circle, a hollow circle, or even a checkmark or star, depending on what's available).
5. The bullet point should appear in your document!

## Customizing Your Bullet Points

If you want to get even more creative with your bullet points, there are several ways to customize them. For example, you can:

- Change the color of the bullet point
- Change the size or style of the font used for the bullet point text
- Use custom icons or images as bullet points

To do any of these things, you'll need to use the advanced formatting options available in your chosen document editor (e.g., Google Docs, Microsoft Word, etc.). However, the basic keyboard shortcuts we've covered here will give you a solid foundation from which to begin.

## Conclusion

Using keyboard shortcuts to create bullet points might seem like a small thing, but over time, those small time savings can really add up.
