Hopefully, the cost of living won't be skyrocketing for much longer. But in the meantime, grabbing all the bargains we can is still crucial. Fortunately, they're there if you look hard enough, for everything from work tools to online skills training.
However, while an annual Sam's Club membership will always be a truly excellent value that you save big on everything throughout the year, new members will appreciate the opportunity to get a Sam's Club Plus Membership at 50% off.
Sam's Club is a membership warehouse club offering exceptional value on high-quality products that traditional retailers can't match. Rated five stars in our store, this subscription will help you find amazingly low prices on all types of goods, from groceries and electronics to kitchen supplies, furniture, and much more. You'll even receive a free household card to help you score even greater savings on already low-priced items.
Member-exclusive prices at select locations mean you won't pay as much at the pump. Other benefits include flat tire repair, wiper blade installation, and battery testing from the Tire and Battery center. The benefits aren't limited to in-store deals, either. There are discounts on hotels, rental cars, live events, attractions, movies, and more.
As a Plus member, you'll get even more perks. Your subscription includes early shopping, which allows you to beat the crowds, and free shipping on eligible items. And if you prefer picking up your groceries yourself, you can simply pay, park, and pick up orders curbside; they will be loaded into your car at no charge, while regular members are charged $4 for the service.
Obviously, all of that is wonderful. Yet you will accumulate optical savings such as free shipping for contact lenses and eyeglasses at 20% off, plus additional savings from the pharmacy on more than 600 generic medications. There are even Instant Savings offers added to the usual low prices. To top it all off, qualifying in-club purchases will get you 2% back in Sam's Cash up to $500 each year. 
Lock in your savings today. New members can sign up for a year of Sam's Club Plus for $50, down from $100.
