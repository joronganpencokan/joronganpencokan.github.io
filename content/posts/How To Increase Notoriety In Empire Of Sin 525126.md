## Stay One Step Ahead of Your Rivals

Chicago is a dangerous place, and rival gangs are always looking for ways to take you down. Stay one step ahead of the competition by keeping track of their moves and predicting their next moves.

Spy on rival bosses to learn about their plans and weaknesses. Keep an eye on the city’s power struggles and exploit any opportunities that arise.

Above all, never underestimate your enemies. Be prepared for all eventualities and stay adaptable to changing circumstances.

## Create Your Own Notoriety

In Empire of Sin, your notoriety is everything. The more famous you become, the more respect you’ll command from your followers and rivals alike.

Create your own notoriety by completing quests, taking over territories, and building your criminal empire. But don’t forget about the importance of reputation; being seen as ruthless and cunning can be just as effective as raw power.

And when all else fails, don’t be afraid to use a little intimidation to get your way. A well-timed show of force can go a long way towards creating the kind of fear and respect that will keep you on top.
