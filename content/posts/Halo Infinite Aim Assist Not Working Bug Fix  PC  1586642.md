# You Won't Believe the Glitch in Halo Infinite's Aim Assist! Find out How to Fix it on PC Now!

Are you a Halo Infinite player on PC? Have you noticed a glitch in the aim assist system that has been causing frustration amidst gameplay? If so, you are not alone. Many players have been experiencing this problem, which has been disrupting their accuracy, making it nearly impossible to hit a target.

This glitch is causing a lot of trouble for players, especially those who are accustomed to playing first-person shooter games with aim assistance. So, in this article, we will explain the problem and provide a handy solution to this issue.

## The Glitch

In the multiplayer version of Halo Infinite, players have reported a bug with the game's aim assist. Many players have complained that the aim assist does not work as it should, which makes it nearly impossible to hit targets in the game. 

This glitch causes the aim assist effect to be too aggressive; it pulls the aim too far towards a target and then continues to keep the aim locked on, even if the target has moved out of view. This makes it challenging for players to kill an enemy, as the aim assist is continuously pulling their aim in the wrong direction.

## The Solution

The solution to this glitch is relatively simple. Players can solve the aim assist problem in Halo Infinite by heading to the game's settings and adjusting the aim assist settings. This method will not only fix the issue but also allows players to customize their aim sensitivity, which can give them a better gaming experience.

To change the aim assist settings, players need to follow these steps:

1. Open the Halo Infinite game.
2. Go to the "Options" menu.
3. Click on the "Controls" tab.
4. Select "Advanced" from the list.
5. Scroll down and find "Aim Assist."
6. Choose the "Legacy" setting for the Aim Assist profile.

By selecting the Legacy profile, the aim assist in Halo Infinite will work correctly, without the over-aggressive characteristic that was causing the glitch.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, if you're one of the affected Halo Infinite players struggling with the over-aggressive aim assist glitch, now you know how to solve the issue. Simply change the aim assist profile to "Legacy," and you will experience the enhanced gaming experience that you deserve.

We hope this article has helped you find a solution to the issue, and now you can carry on with enjoying Halo Infinite online, without losing precious game time on trying to battle the game's aim assist bug.

## How to Fix Halo Infinite Aim Assist Not Working Bug (PC)
 

 
The only way that you can fix this bug as of now is to close the game, relaunch it and press the start button on your controller. But if restarting the game and pressing the button on your controller does not work, then all you can do is wait for a patch from the developers which will fix this problem.
 
### What causes this Aim Assist bug?
 
What basically happens is that at the title screen, the game asks you to press a particular button to start playing. If you press Enter on your keyboard instead of the button on your controller, the game thinks that you are playing with a mouse/keyboard. This is when you may get the Halo Infinite Aim Assist bug. It doesn’t happen 100% of the time but this issue is occurring quite often. So just make sure to press the button on your controller to start playing and the game will continue with aim assist.
