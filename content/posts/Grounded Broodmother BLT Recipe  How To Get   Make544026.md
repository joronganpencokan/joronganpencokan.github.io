Check out this guide to know the recipe for making a Broodmother BLT in the game.
 
## Where to Find The Broodmother BLT in Grounded (Location)
 
Here’s where you can find the Broodmother BLT recipe in the game:
 
- Get near the Hedge located on the northern side of the Hedge Lab.
 - Now, continue walking upwards by taking the glass tunnel-like pathway until you reach a room with broken glass and a zip line.
 - In addition, stay away from the Spiders as you will find them in abundance. Later, use the zip-line and jump in the middle to land on top of another lab.
 - From there, you may notice that there are berries hanging on the branches. From there, walk all the way to the top until you see a white circular outpost.
 - Enter the outpost to obtain the Broodmother BLT recipe in Grounded.

 
## How to Make the Broodmother BLT (Recipe)
 

 
A Broodmother BLT can be made only with the help of an Oven. Now, you require a total of 10x Clay, 4x EverChar Coal Chunk, and 4x Boiling Gland in order to acquire an Oven. Further, you require certain materials in order to craft a Broodmother BLT in Grounded. You require 2x Ladybug Part, 2x Bombardier Part, and 1x Thistle Needle to finally make a BLT.
 
Ladybug Part can be acquired from Ladybug found anywhere on the map. However, there’s a very rare chance that the Ladybug will drop a Ladybug part after defeat. Make sure to decimate almost every Ladybug you encounter to increase your chances of getting a Ladybug part. Thereafter, Bombardier Parts can be obtained after defeating a Bombardier Beetle in the game. Finally, Thistle Needles are acquired from Thistle plants scattered everywhere in the Backyard. You simply have to get near the plants and pick the Needle out from its stems.
 
After getting all three items, use the Oven to craft the Broodmother BLT. Later, use it to spawn the Hedge Broodmother boss creature.
