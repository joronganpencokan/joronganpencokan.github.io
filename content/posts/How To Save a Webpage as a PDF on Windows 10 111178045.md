Are you tired of bookmarking webpages for future reference, only to find out they are no longer available when you need them? Or maybe you need to share an online article with a colleague or client, but the website is blocked in their region? Whatever the case, saving webpages as PDF is the perfect solution. 

But how do you save a webpage as a PDF on Windows 10 or 11? You may think it's a difficult process, but it's actually quite simple. All you need is the built-in print to PDF feature in Windows. Here's how to do it. 

Step 1: Open the webpage you want to save as a PDF in your web browser. 

Step 2: Click on the three dots on the top-right corner of your screen. This will open the browser's menu. 

Step 3: Click on "Print" from the menu options. 

Step 4: In the print window, select "Microsoft Print to PDF" as the printer. 

Step 5: Click on the "Print" button. 

Step 6: In the "Save Print Output As" window, select the location where you want to save the PDF file, give it a name, and click on "Save". 

Congratulations! You have successfully saved a webpage as a PDF on Windows 10 or 11. 

But wait, there's more! You can customize your PDF file by adjusting the settings in the print window. For example, you can choose to print only selected pages or print in grayscale instead of color. 

Additionally, if you want to save a webpage as a PDF frequently, you can create a shortcut for the "Print" command. Here's how: 

Step 1: Right-click on your desktop screen and select "New" and then "Shortcut". 

Step 2: In the "Type the location of the item" field, enter "chrome.exe /path/to/webpage --kiosk-printing". Replace "chrome.exe" with your browser's executable name and "/path/to/webpage" with the actual URL of the webpage you want to save. 

Step 3: Give the shortcut a name and click "Finish". 

Now, every time you click on this shortcut, the web page will automatically open in your browser's "Print" window, and you can save it as a PDF in a single click.
