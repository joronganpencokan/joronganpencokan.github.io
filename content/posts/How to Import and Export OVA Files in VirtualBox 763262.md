You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Import And Export Ova Files In Virtualbox!

Virtualization has revolutionized the way we use our computers. We can now run multiple operating systems on a single machine, without having to buy additional hardware. This has made it possible for developers and IT professionals to test software and run different environments. VirtualBox is one of the most popular virtualization applications, and it offers many features that make it easy to create and manage virtual machines. One of the most useful features of VirtualBox is the ability to import and export OVA files.

What Is An OVA File?

Before we dive into how to import and export OVA files in VirtualBox, let's first understand what an OVA file is. OVA (Open Virtualization Format Archive) is a packaged file format for distributing virtual machines. The OVA file contains all the necessary files, including the disk image files, configuration files, and virtual machine settings. It is like a zipped file that contains everything required to run a virtual machine.

Why Export And Import OVA Files In VirtualBox?

There are different reasons why you may need to export or import OVA files. The most common reasons include:

- Sharing virtual machines with colleagues or clients
- Migrating virtual machines between hosts or data centers
- Backing up virtual machines for disaster recovery or testing purposes

Exporting OVA Files In VirtualBox

Exporting an OVA file in VirtualBox is a straightforward process, and it only takes a few clicks. Here is how to do it:

1. Open VirtualBox and select the virtual machine you want to export.
2. Click on the "File" menu and select "Export Appliance."
3. Choose the virtual machine you want to export and select the destination folder where you want to save the OVA file.
4. Review the settings to confirm that everything is correct, then click "Export."

Importing OVA Files In VirtualBox

Importing an OVA file in VirtualBox is as easy as exporting. Here is how to do it:

1. Open VirtualBox and click on the "File" menu.
2. Select "Import Appliance."
3. Browse to the OVA file's location and select it.
4. Review the settings, then click "Import."

Conclusion

As you can see, importing and exporting OVA files in VirtualBox is effortless. Whether you are sharing virtual machines with colleagues, migrating virtual machines between hosts or data centers, or backing up virtual machines for disaster recovery or testing purposes, the OVA file format makes the process straightforward. With VirtualBox's intuitive interface, you can perform these tasks with ease. Try it out today and see how it works for you.

One of the biggest strengths in working with virtual machines is their portability. It’s great to be able to create VMs on one machine and move them to another or create and clone an entire deployment of VMs.
 
At the same time, you can find pre-configured virtual machines online that you can import in a snap and get working right away. Here we show you how to import and export OVA files in VirtualBox.
 
## What Is an OVA File
 
An OVA file (Open Virtual Appliances) is a package that contains files used to describe a virtual machine. It includes a descriptor file (.OVF), optional manifest (.MF), certificate files, and other related files. All this data is saved in the Open Virtualization Format, which is a standard format used to package and distribute software run in virtual machines.
 
Ideally, you would have to go through the entire process of installing the OS on your second virtual machine through the ISO file and manually copy all the settings. To make this process seamless, you can simply export the OVA file from the virtual machine you want to clone and import it to your new setup. 
 
## Importing an OVA
 
When you have VirtualBox running, locate “File” in the top menu and click on it, then select “Import Appliance.” VirtualBox refers to virtual machines as appliances.
 
A new window will pop open with a field to select your .ova file. Browse to the file you’d like to import. VirtualBox will take a few seconds to read the information on the file.
 
The window will shift to a table that lets you choose the settings for your soon-to-be-imported appliance. From here, you can set key features of the virtual machine, like the amount of available memory. When you’re ready, click on the “Import” button and let VirtualBox run the import process.
 
It can take a few minutes for VirtualBox to complete the import process depending on the file size. 
 
After the process completes, your VM will be ready to use.
 
## Exporting an OVA
 
Exporting OVA files may be even more important than importing them. It’s a great way to back up and take snapshots of your VMs. Exporting your OVAs also enables you to clone them across multiple machines or run simultaneous instances of your VMs on the same computer.
 
Return to the “File” menu and, this time, click “Export Appliance.”
 
VirtualBox will open a new window with a listing of your available virtual machines. Select the VM you want to export.
 
The following window allows you to select the location for your exported OVA file. These files can be very large, so make sure you have enough space available in that destination drive to support the resulting file.
 
The next screen is the final one in the export process. Another table allows you to attach some identifying information and specifics to your file before packing it up. Generally, the name and description are what you’ll be using, but you can certainly use the more detailed product fields for VMs that you intend to distribute. Click on the “Export” button to start the export process. 
 
With everything set, VirtualBox will kick off the process of rolling your VM into an OVA file. Depending on the size of the VM, it may take some time but typically takes a few minutes on average.
 
## Frequently Asked Questions
 
### 1. Where can I download preconfigured virtual machines?
 
If you are interested in downloading preconfigured virtual machines or Virtual Disk Images (VDIs), here are a few websites to help you:
 
- OS BoxesVirtual BoxesSysprobes

 
### 2. How can I extract the contents of an OVA file?
 
Apart from importing an OVA file into virtualization applications such as VMware and VirtualBox, you can use file archiver programs like WinRar and 7-Zip to extract the contents of an OVA file.
 
### 3. What is the difference between an ISO and an OVA file?
 
To put it simply, ISO files are complete disk images that contain all the data of a disk, including its file system information. This format is mostly used to distribute large files without having to share a physical disk, whereas OVA files contain a compressed version of a virtual machine. You can use it to extract the VM and install it on your computer.
