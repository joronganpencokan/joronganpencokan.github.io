If you're a Minecraft player, then you know the importance of smooth stones in the game. Smooth stone is the go-to material for building structures, crafting tools, and making fire. However, it's not always easy to obtain smooth stones in the game. Fortunately, with a few secret techniques, you can make smooth stones in Minecraft easily.

In this expert guide, we'll explore the step-by-step process of making smooth stone in Minecraft. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced minecrafter, this article will equip you with the necessary knowledge to make smooth stones effortlessly.

Step 1: Gather Materials

The first step in making smooth stones is to gather the necessary materials. In Minecraft, you'll need the following materials to make smooth stone:

● Furnace
● Cobblestones

The furnace is used to turn cobblestones into smooth stones. You can craft a furnace by gathering eight cobblestones and placing them in the following pattern:

Once you've crafted a furnace, you're ready to move on to the next step.

Step 2: Place Cobblestones In The Furnace

Now that you've crafted a furnace, the next step is to place cobblestones in the furnace. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the furnace to open its interface.
2. Place cobblestones in the top slot of the furnace.

Once you've placed the cobblestones in the furnace, it will start burning and slowly turn into smooth stones.

Step 3: Wait For The Cobblestones To Turn Into Smooth Stones

Now that the furnace is burning and the cobblestones are inside, you'll need to wait a few moments for the cobblestones to turn into smooth stones. The time it takes for the cobblestones to turn into smooth stones depends on the materials used and the type of furnace you're using.

The default furnace takes 10 seconds to turn a single cobblestone into a smooth stone. However, if you're using a blast furnace, the process is much quicker. A blast furnace takes only 3.75 seconds to turn a single cobblestone into a smooth stone.

Step 4: Collect The Smooth Stones

Once the cobblestones have finished turning into smooth stones, you'll need to collect them. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the furnace to open its interface.
2. Take the smooth stones from the bottom slot of the furnace.

Congratulations! You've successfully made smooth stones in Minecraft.
