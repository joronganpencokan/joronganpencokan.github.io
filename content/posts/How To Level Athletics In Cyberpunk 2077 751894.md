If you're looking to become a top athlete in Night City, then you're in the right place. Cyberpunk 2077 has an extensive skill system that you can use to create an extremely agile, athletic character to traverse the city with ease. In this article, we provide you with top pro-tips to unlock insane athletic skills in Cyberpunk 2077.

1) Master the Jumping Technique

The jumping technique is critical if you want to move past tricky obstacles in Night City. By utilizing the jump key, you can vault over ledges, scale walls, and even gracefully land from a great height. To enhance this technique, invest in Athletics points to unlock the double jump, which allows you to jump twice in quick succession, giving you even better maneuverability.

2) Build Your Endurance

Endurance is key in Cyberpunk 2077, especially when you have to sprint long distances across Night City. Keep a constant eye on your stamina bar, and in cases of emergencies, use inhalers to restore your stamina instantly. It's best to equip clothing and armor that boosts your stamina pool as well.

3) Body Mods Are Your Best Friend

Body mods not only make you look cool but can also provide you with athletic bonuses. These body modifications range from the Fortified Ankles, which reduce fall damage, to the Reinforced Tendons, which increase your movement speed. In addition to these, implanting the cyberware skeleton mod can boost running and other athletic performances.

4) Parkour-style Movement is the Key to Success

Parkour is practically an art in Night City. It involves a combination of running, jumping, and crawling quickly through the environment. To execute parkour moves, players need to master wall runs, sliding, and dodging obstacles. To do this, invest in proficiency points to improve your character's agility and stamina. This makes executing parkour moves a breeze.

5) Explore Night City For Hidden Gems

Exploring Night City can be a treasure trove for players looking to enhance their athleticism. Scattered throughout the city, you'll encounter several anatomic and stamina boosting beverages resting on various corner pharmacies. Additionally, as a special reward for players, they will encounter random NPCs that are skilled in different athletics. Engaging in fights with them will unlock new challenges and finesse ways to dodge and counterattack.

To top it all off, players that go the extra mile and complete various athletic challenges found out and about in Night City will be rewarded with powerful clothing and weapon mods that emphasize agility, movement speed, and quick reflexes.

In conclusion, Cyberpunk 2077 features an intricate skill system that allows players to enhance their athleticism through various methods. Master parkour-style movement, build up your endurance, modify your body, and explore Night City to unlock insane athletic skills. With these pro tips, be guaranteed of an unforgettable experience while traversing Night City.
