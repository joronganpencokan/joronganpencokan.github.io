If you own a home theater, you know how important it is to have the right audio and video connectivity options. However, in recent years, the technology behind these connections has evolved at such a rapid pace that it's easy for your home theater to become outdated quickly. One of the biggest shocks to home theater enthusiasts has been the disappearance of analog video connectors, which were once ubiquitous and easy to use. In this article, we'll take a closer look at why this has happened and what you can do to stay up-to-date.

The Rise of Digital

The main reason for the disappearance of analog video connectors is the rise of digital technology. Digital signals offer better image quality and sound, making them the standard for most modern devices. HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) has become the go-to connector for digital video, allowing for high-definition video up to 4K with surround sound. This is why most new devices no longer feature analog video connectors. In fact, some newer devices don't even offer analog audio connectors.

It's not just video that has gone digital. The same is true for audio. Digital audio offers the same benefits as digital video: higher quality and more versatility. Optical and coaxial digital audio are the most common connectors for home theater systems. These connectors are also used for multi-channel audio, which is essential for surround sound.

The End of the Road for Analog

Analog technology has been around for a long time, but its limitations have become more apparent as digital technology has advanced. Analog signals degrade over long distances, so they can only be transmitted reliably over short distances. They are also susceptible to interference from other electronic devices, which can cause distortion or noise in the signal. This is why digital technology has become the norm for home theaters. Digital signals are immune to interference and can be transmitted over longer distances without losing quality.

What Can You Do?

If your home theater still relies on analog video or audio connectivity, you may be wondering what you can do to upgrade. The first step is to identify what connectors you currently have and what you need for your devices. For example, if you have an older DVD player that only has analog connectors, you may need a new player that has HDMI or digital audio connectors. If your TV only has analog connectors, you may need a new TV with HDMI connectors.

Another option is to use a converter. There are many converters available that can convert analog signals to digital signals, allowing you to use your older devices with modern home theater systems. However, keep in mind that converters can degrade the signal quality, so it's better to use digital signals whenever possible.

Conclusion

The disappearance of analog video and audio connectors may be shocking, but it's a natural progression in the evolution of technology. Digital signals offer higher quality and more versatility, which is essential for modern home theater systems. If your system still relies on analog connectors, don't worry; there are ways to upgrade and stay current with the latest technology. With the right connections, you can enjoy the best audio and video quality in your home theater.

In a home theater setup, you need to connect everything to make it work correctly. The cables and wires provide multiple ways to connect old and new components. With the accelerated pace of change from analog to digital, a trend has emerged that puts a connection squeeze on the ability to link older components to new ones.

 

Consumer electronics manufacturers have eliminated several legacy connections from home theater components used for years or even decades, limiting the practical use of older, but still functioning, devices that use these connections exclusively.

 

Here are examples of connections that are being, or have been, eliminated.

 
##   S-Video Connections  
 

Most TVs, home theater receivers, and other video source components no longer have S-Video connections. Legacy devices that use this connection are S-VHS VCRs and camcorders, Hi8 camcorders, mini-DV camcorders, older DVD players, AV switchers, and most remaining LaserDisc players.

 
##   Component Video Connections  
 

Below is a set of component video connections. A policy referred to as the Analog Sunset eliminates the practicality of component video connections due to copy-protection regulations and the rapid acceptance of HDMI as the standard for high-definition video transfer.

 

Custom installers that previously wired homes using component video connections for high-definition video connectivity have to convert to HDMI.

 
##   The Composite vs. Component Video Input Dilemma  
 

An additional development regarding the use of Component Video connections is that a growing number of TVs combine both composite and component video inputs.

 

Most TVs no longer connect to both a composite and component video source to the TV simultaneously, such as VCRs, older non-upscaling DVD players, or standard definition cable or satellite boxes.

 
##   Multi-Channel 5.1/7.1 Channel Analog Audio Connections  
 

Pictured below is a set of 5.1/7.1 channel analog audio inputs. With HDMI's rapid adoption, the need for these connections is fading. Many newer home theater receivers are eliminating the 5.1/7.1 channel analog connection option.

 

However, consumers who own older SACD or DVD/SACD/DVD-Audio players without HDMI connections rely on these connections to access full multi-channel uncompressed audio from their players to a home theater receiver.

 

Eliminating this connection option renders those older players useless when accessing full audio capabilities using many newer home theater receivers.

 

On the opposite end of the connection flow, 5.1/7.1 channel analog audio connections are also being eliminated by manufacturers as an audio output option on Blu-ray Disc players. This is a problem, as many older home theater receivers still in use have eliminated a corresponding set of analog audio inputs.

 
##   The Strange Case of Phono Turntable Connections  
 

A phono input connects a turntable to a home theater receiver. With the introduction of CDs, home theater receiver makers began to eliminate this connection option on most home theater receivers, even on high-end units.

 
Only a limited number of high-end Blu-ray Disc players provide 5.1/7.1 channel analog audio outputs.
 

Due to the increasing popularity of vinyl records (even in the face of streaming), the phono input is making a comeback.

 

Depending on a home theater receiver's model or year, it could have a phono input. 

 

For an older turntable that is in good working order and a receiver without a phono connection, you might need an additional external phono preamp to match the turntable's voltage and equalization output.

 

Another option is to purchase one of the growing numbers of new turntables with both standard and built-in phono preamp outputs.

 
##   What Changed in 2013  
 

All analog video outputs (Composite, S-video, Component) were eliminated on Blu-ray Disc players made after 2013. HDMI is the only way to connect Blu-ray Disc players to TVs (the HDMI-to-DVI adapter option is still possible).

 

Although not required, manufacturers began to eliminate analog audio connections on a growing number of players after 2013.

 

Below is an example of how AV outputs have changed on most Blu-ray Disc players.
