Revolutionary! Google unveils groundbreaking tool that helps greenify your travel plans!

In today's world, it is impossible to ignore the effects of humans on the environment. With climate change and global warming threatening our planet, it is necessary to take measures to protect our surroundings. One of the ways to do that is by reducing our carbon footprint. Google has unveiled a tool that will help greenify your travel plans, and it's revolutionary.

The tool is called the Google Travel Carbon Footprint, and it is a new feature available for Google's travel tool. The tool is designed to help users calculate the carbon emissions of their flights, hotel stays, and car rentals. The tool uses data from Google's partnerships with transportation and hotel companies to provide users with accurate carbon emission estimates.

The tool is simple to use. All you have to do is enter details about your travel plans such as your destination, mode of transportation, and the length of your stay. The tool will then calculate the estimated carbon emissions of your trip. It will also provide tips on how to reduce your carbon footprint, such as choosing a more eco-friendly mode of transportation or staying in a green-certified hotel.

This groundbreaking tool is the first of its kind to be integrated into a travel tool. It is an important step towards encouraging people to be more environmentally conscious when traveling. By providing users with information about the carbon emissions of their travel plans, Google is helping travelers make informed decisions that are better for the environment.

The Google Travel Carbon Footprint tool is also part of Google's larger initiative to reduce its own carbon footprint. Google has committed to operating on 100% renewable energy and becoming carbon-neutral by 2020. The company has also created tools to help people make more sustainable choices in their daily lives, such as Google Nest, a smart home system that helps reduce energy consumption.

In conclusion, the Google Travel Carbon Footprint tool is an essential tool for those who want to make more sustainable travel choices. By providing users with accurate carbon emission estimates and tips on how to reduce their carbon footprint, Google is helping people make a positive impact on the environment. This revolutionary tool is a testament to Google's commitment to sustainability and sets an excellent example for other companies to follow.



Google has some new features for its Travel offshoot to give you more control over the environmental impact of your rail and air excursions.

 

If you're trying to be more eco-friendly but also like to (or need to) travel, Google Travel has been updated to make plotting a lower emission course easier. Some new travel search options have been added to Google Travelâ€”for booking hotels, flights, and train tickets.

 

Now you can filter your potential travel carbon footprint when inquiring about flights and hotels. For air travel, all you have to do is search for the flights you want, then use the new Low Emissions filter to bump the lowest emission available flights to the top. You can do the same for hotels via the new "Eco-certified" filter that refines your search to only show eco-certified properties.

 

Travel by train is generally the least impactful form of mass transit despite emissions due to its passenger capacity (compared to airplanes), but it can be tricky to sync up schedules. Now Google will let you search for train tickets in and around specific countries like Germany, Italy, Japan, or Spain, and it will work out the necessary line transfers for you. Plug in your point of origin and destination, then let it do the rest. Once you have a route you like, it'll provide you with a direct link to book everything you need.

 

Air and rail travel eco-friendly search options are up and running right now, and Google plans to expand coverage for more trains in more locations over time. It also plans to implement a similar search function for bus tickets and other travel at some point "in the near future."
