# Unleash the Fire of Halo Infinite's Heatwave! Learn How to Get and Use This Game-Changing Weapon Now!

If you're a fan of Halo Infinite and looking to add a new addition to your emergency weapons stash, then look no further than the Heatwave. This game-changing weapon is the latest addition to the Halo armory and packs a serious punch. In this article, we'll be diving into everything you need to know about the Heatwave - from how to get it in-game to its devastating impact in combat. So, let's get started!

## How to Obtain the Heatwave

First off, it's essential to know how to get the Heatwave. The good news is that you can unlock the Heatwave by leveling up and earning Battle Pass rewards. It's currently available through Tier 16 of the Battle Pass, or via the shop for 900 Credits. That said, if you want to get your hands on it as soon as possible, you can purchase it directly from the shop, bypassing the grind.

## Heatwave Stats and Features

The Heatwave is a powerful weapon that has a unique firing method. It fires a horizontal spread of plasma bolts that can deal serious damage to targets caught in its wake. It boasts a longer range than standard shotguns and has a three-round burst fire rate that ensures your enemies don't stand a chance. It's coupled with a side-loading feature that etches a "C" shape in the air to indicate the weapon's hail of fiery rounds.

## Tips for Using the Heatwave

Now that you know how to obtain the Heatwave let's dive into some tips for using it effectively. First, you should always try to aim for your target's torso or head, as this will maximize the amount of damage you can deal. It's important to note that the Heatwave is a short-range weapon, so make sure to use it in close-quarter-combat situations. Additionally, the Heatwave is not the fastest-firing weapon, so it's crucial to take advantage of the burst-fire mode to ensure accuracy and reduce the need for constant reloading.

Another critical aspect of using the Heatwave is positioning. It's essential to ensure you have a good line of sight on your target before using the Heatwave. This could mean flanking your enemy to get a better angle or positioning yourself behind reliable cover before attacking.

## Conclusion

The Heatwave is an excellent addition to your Halo Infinite armory that can produce fireworks like no other. With its unique firing pattern and devastating impact, it's a must-have for anyone looking for an edge in close-quarter combat. After reading this article, you now know how to get the Heatwave, its stats and features, and some useful tips for using it effectively in the game - now it's time to unleash the fire!

Halo Infinite launched with a crazy arsenal of weapons and Heatwave is a new yet known weapon that is part of that arsenal. I am here to tell you how to get your hands on the Heatwave shotgun and how you can use it to its maximum potential.
 
## How to get Heatwave in Halo Infinite
 

 
Remember the scattershot shotgun from Halo 4&5? It’s back! With a new look, new name, and added functionality. The shotgun, this time around, goes by the name of Heatwave. Just like any other weapon in the way, the Heatwave will spawn at pick-up points around the map, depending on the map. You can even get it from an ordnance drop and let me tell you, in the right hands, this gun will be a killing machine.
 
### What is Heatwave and how to use it?
 
Just like the scattershot, introduced in Halo 4 and updated in 5, the Heatwave comes with projectiles that bounce around (or scatter) after hitting surfaces, this time for much longer, and an added benefit is that they even have very minor tracking. Heatwave functions a bit differently this time around, with the main draw being that it has 2 firing modes.
 
The Horizontal shot or the normal firing mode fires 6 projectiles in a horizontal line that damages anyone standing in front of the barrel. Since the projectiles fire in a line, they can hit multiple targets at once and deal a decent chunk of damage, and the remaining shots will hit surfaces and bounce around for a bit. The alternate firing mode, however, tightens the spread and makes it a more traditional shotgun, and is incredible for close quarters.
 
Shotguns come with a specific playstyle and are not everybody’s cup of tea. This one comes with an added disadvantage of learning the weapon and when to use what firing mode and how to use it. Despite that, the Heatwave is a banger weapon that comes with a unique playstyle (like many other Halo Infinite weapons) and in the right hands can become the ultimate tool of destruction. I’d highly recommend to not sleep on this gun or shrug it off as another shotgun. Learn it, master it and watch enemy Spartans crumble in front of you.
