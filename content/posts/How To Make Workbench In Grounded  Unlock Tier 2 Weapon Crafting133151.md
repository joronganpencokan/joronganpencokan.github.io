# Unlock the Ultimate Crafting Arsenal in Grounded with This Amazing Workbench Hack - Level Up to Tier 2 Weapon Crafting NOW!

Grounded is an utterly engaging game about exploration and survival in your backyard. It has become incredibly popular among gamers worldwide with its unique gameplay, breathtaking graphics, and an immersive world of tiny creatures. Grounded offers various crafting options to the player, from simple tools like axes and hammers to more advanced weapons such as spears and even an insect-powered bow. However, to craft these advanced weapons, you need to reach a higher tier, and for that, you need to upgrade your workbench. Don't worry; we have an amazing hack that can help you upgrade your workbench instantly to level 2, allowing you to unlock a more impressive crafting arsenal.

## Why Upgrade Your Workbench?

The workbench is like the hub for crafting. Everything from simple tools to advanced weaponry requires a workbench to craft. In the early stages of the game, you'll be able to craft only basic items. However, as you progress, you'll need to upgrade your workbench to unlock more advanced crafting options. Upgrading your workbench will enable you to craft items with better quality, durability, and overall stronger performance. You'll be able to create more potent weapons that can deal more significant damage to enemies, making your survival in the game much easier.

## The Workbench Hack

The workbench hack requires a little bit of patience but is worth the wait. To upgrade your workbench, you need to gather four items, namely rope, spider silk, woven fiber, and berry leather. Once you have these, create a 'cloud save' of your character on the main menu, just to be on the safe side. After creating the cloud save, open your saved game and head towards your workbench. Interact with it and choose to upgrade it. Once you do, the game will ask you to confirm your decision. Instead of confirming, turn off your console or PC. This is where the cloud save you made comes in handy. Load up that saved game and voila! Your workbench is now upgraded to level 2, and you have unlocked the ability to craft tier 2 weapons.

## Benefits of the Workbench Hack

This workbench hack is a quick and effortless way to upgrade your workbench without grinding in the game. It enables you to craft more advanced weaponry, armor and equipment, and helps you survive the game. You'll be able to create new items, such as the ant club, spear, acorn armor, and insect bow. These items will help you tackle the game's more challenging areas and enemies, making your gameplay more enjoyable.

### Conclusion

Grounded is an amazing game that requires players to be creative, strategic, and patient. Upgrading your workbench is an essential part of progressing in the game. This workbench hack is an excellent way to bypass the game's grind and allows you to unlock and create better items instantly. Remember, though, hacking is not always the way to go. It is essential to enjoy the game's content and earn rewards through gameplay. However, in this case, it's a fun and quick way to unlock the game's hidden gems. Try out this workbench hack and see how much difference it makes in your gaming experience!
