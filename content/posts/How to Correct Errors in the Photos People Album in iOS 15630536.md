# Revamp Your Photo Collection: Quick and Easy Fix for iOS 15's People Album Mistakes!

Are you suffering from the annoying mistake in your People album in iOS 15? You are not alone as it is a common issue among iPhone users. In this article, we will show you a quick and easy way to fix the mistake and revamp your photo collection. So, let's get started!

## The Issue

With the release of iOS 15, Apple introduced the People album, which automatically scans your photos and categorizes the images based on the people in them. However, the algorithm is not perfect, and sometimes it makes mistakes. For instance, it might group photos of your best friend with a stranger who looks slightly similar.

## The Fix

Fortunately, there is an easy way to fix the mistake and improve the accuracy of the People album. Here are the steps:

1. Open the People album in your Photos app.
2. Tap on the mislabeled person's name.
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and tap on "Merge People."
4. Select the person's name that you want to keep.
5. Tap on the "Merge" button.

By merging the two people, you are essentially telling the algorithm that they are the same person, and it will update the People album accordingly. You can repeat this process for any other mislabeled people in your album.

## The Benefits

Fixing the mistake in the People album can bring several benefits. Firstly, it makes it easier to find photos of specific people in your collection. For instance, if you want to show your friend some pictures of your trip to Hawaii, you can now simply search for their face and find all the photos you took together.

Secondly, it enhances the accuracy of facial recognition. The more you curate the People album, the better the algorithm becomes at recognizing faces. This will save you time in the future when you want to locate a specific photo.

Finally, it makes your photo collection more organized and aesthetic. The People album is an excellent way to segment your photos into categories, and when it is accurate, it becomes a visually pleasing way to browse your collection.

## Conclusion

Mistakes in the People album in iOS 15 can be frustrating, but they are easy to fix. By using the merge people feature in your app, you can improve the accuracy of the album and revamp your photo collection. With the right steps, you can enjoy all the benefits of a well-organized and easy-to-browse photo album.
