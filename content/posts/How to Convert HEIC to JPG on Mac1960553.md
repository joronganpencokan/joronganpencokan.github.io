# Unleash the Ultimate Mac Hack: Learn How to Transform HEIC to JPG with One Simple Click!

If you are a Mac user, then you must have already noticed that the default file format for pictures taken with an iPhone is the High-Efficiency Image Format (HEIC). While it is supposed to offer better quality and smaller file sizes, the downside is that you may not be able to open it on some devices or software.

Luckily, there's a simple hack that can help you convert HEIC to JPG without any hassle. Here are the steps:

1. Select the HEIC files you want to convert.
2. Right-click on the selection and choose "Open with" in the context menu.
3. Select "Preview" from the list of apps.
4. In Preview, click on "File" in the menu bar and then choose "Export".
5. In the Export dialog box, choose "JPEG" as the format.
6. Adjust the settings according to your preference and click "Save".

And that's it! Your HEIC files are now converted to JPG.

Alternatively, you can also change the default image format for your iPhone by going to Settings > Camera > Formats and selecting "Most Compatible". This will ensure that your pictures are saved in JPG format from now on.

But why should you bother with this hack in the first place? For one thing, as mentioned earlier, not all devices and software can handle HEIC files. If you want to share your pictures with someone who doesn't use Apple products, converting to JPG ensures maximum compatibility.

Another advantage of using JPG is that it is a more widely recognized file format. This means that it is more likely to be supported by third-party apps and services. For instance, uploading pictures to social media sites like Facebook or Instagram may be easier if the files are in JPG format.

In conclusion, converting HEIC to JPG may seem like a small tweak, but it can make a big difference in terms of convenience and compatibility. So the next time you take pictures on your iPhone, don't forget to use this ultimate Mac hack to unleash the full potential of your photos!
