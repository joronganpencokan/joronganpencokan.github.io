The Surge 2 is a challenging game that requires players to navigate through various enemies and bosses in order to progress. One of the toughest bosses that you will encounter is the Level 5 Gaia Statue in Gideon Rock. Taking down this boss can seem like a daunting task, but with the right strategy and preparation, it is surprisingly easy to defeat. Read on for the ultimate guide to the Surge 2 boss fight and learn how you can take down the Level 5 Gaia Statue with ease.

Before you start the fight, it is important to make sure that you are adequately equipped for the battle. Make sure that you have upgraded your weapons and armor, and that you have any helpful consumables like Medi-Voltaic Injectors and Cleansing Broth at the ready. You should also ensure that you have a clear understanding of the Level 5 Gaia Statue’s attack patterns, which can help you avoid taking too much damage during the fight.

Once you are prepared, it is time to start the fight. The first thing you should do is focus on destroying the boss’s arms. These are its primary weapons, and they are capable of dealing significant damage if they remain intact. By targeting the arms, you can disable the boss’s ability to attack and make the fight much easier.

Once you have taken out the arms, the Level 5 Gaia Statue will enter its second phase. During this phase, the boss will use its powerful earthquake attack to stun and damage you. To avoid this attack, you should stay in close proximity to the boss at all times. When the earthquake attack occurs, quickly dodge away from the boss and then move back in to continue attacking.

As you attack the boss, be sure to watch out for its powerful ground slam attack. This attack deals massive damage, so be sure to dodge out of the way if you see the boss preparing to use it. You should also watch out for the boss’s projectile attacks, which can come at you from a distance. These attacks are easier to avoid if you stay in close proximity to the boss, so try to stay as close as possible while also avoiding its attacks.

Overall, taking down the Level 5 Gaia Statue in Gideon Rock is all about preparation, strategy, and perseverance. By understanding the boss’s attack patterns, staying close to it during the fight, and focusing on disabling its arms, you can easily defeat this formidable opponent. So don’t be intimidated by the challenge - with the right tactics, you’ll be able to take down the Level 5 Gaia Statue in no time.

First, use your drone and attack the Leg or Arm. Use the drone to destroy one of its parts completely so that it cannot move, this Level 5 enemy has a shield and a very good range of attack. With shield and spear, it is almost impossible to take down this enemy to break the shield using a charged Horizontal attack. Next, deploy your drone and shoot the leg, the enemy becomes immobile and will not be able to attack you.
