# Unlock Hidden Android Features: Learn How To Install Add Ons Using Magisk Manager!

Android smartphones are one of the most popular devices today. They offer great features that everyone can enjoy. However, just like any other device, there are some hidden features that you can unlock to further enhance your smartphone experience. In this article, we will show you how to install add-ons and unlock hidden features using Magisk Manager.

Magisk Manager is an app that enables you to install modules or add-ons to your Android device. These add-ons can provide additional functionality that is not available in the stock Android operating system. They allow you to customize and modify your device to suit your needs.

## What is Magisk Manager?

Magisk Manager is an open-source rooting solution that allows users to gain root access without modifying the system partition of their Android devices. It is unlike other root apps, such as SuperSU or Kingroot, that modify the device's system partition, which can make it difficult to install OTA updates, and could also cause issues in some apps.

Magisk Manager provides a way to bypass Google's SafetyNet, a security system that checks if your device is secure, by using Magisk Hide. This system allows you to hide root access from any app that checks for it, including banking and payment apps that would normally block you if your device is rooted.

## How to install and use Magisk Manager

1. The first step is to download and install Magisk Manager on your Android device.

2. Once you have Magisk Manager installed, you will need to download Magisk.zip from the official website.

3. Reboot your device into recovery mode. This differs between devices, but the most common way is to press and hold the power button and the volume down button simultaneously.

4. Once you are in recovery mode, select "Install" and navigate to the Magisk.zip file you downloaded earlier.

5. Select "Install" to start the installation process.

6. Once the installation is complete, reboot your device.

7. Open Magisk Manager and check if your device has been successfully rooted.

## How to install modules or add-ons using Magisk Manager

1. Open Magisk Manager, and select the "Downloads" tab.

2. Browse through the available modules and select the module you want to install.

3. Click on the module, and select "Download and Install."

4. Wait for the installation process to complete. Once completed, select "Reboot" to apply the changes.

5. Once your device has rebooted, the module will be installed, and you can start using it.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Magisk Manager allows you to unlock hidden Android features by installing add-ons or modules. It is an open-source rooting solution that is easy to use and provides lots of features that are not available in the stock Android operating system. With Magisk Manager, you can bypass Google's SafetyNet and hide your root access, making your Android device secure and safe to use. Start exploring the various modules and elevate your Android experience to the next level!

Magisk is a popular way to root your Android device and manage root permissions for your apps. It’s easy to use and set up. What most people don’t know, though, is Magisk also makes it super simple to download and flash popular Android add-on software. These add-ons usually enhance Android itself, bringing improvements like better sound processing, new fonts and emojis, and loads of patches and plugins to enhance what’s already there.
 
Magisk’s module system isn’t just convenient for flashing these extras – it also helps you keep them updated and manage them.
 
## Install Magisk and Root Your Device
 
Before you can use Magisk Manager, you’re going to need to install it. Begin by following our Magisk install guide to get set up.
 
## Install a Magisk Module
 
Open the Magisk Manager app on your Android device. The icon is the Magisk mask logo.
 

 
When you first arrive on the home screen, you’ll see your current version of Magisk and the Magisk Manager listed. Make sure there aren’t any updates for it either. If there are, install them first.
 
With Magisk fully up to date, press the three-line menu in the upper-left of your screen. The menu will slide out, showing you the available options for Magisk. Select “Downloads” to see which modules are available.
 
Scroll through the absolutely massive list, and take a look around. There are a lot of modules available, and the list is constantly growing. If there’s something specific that you want, use the search icon (magnifying glass) in the upper-right corner of the screen to search directly.
 
When you find something you like, press the download icon to the right of it. Magisk will ask you if you want to cancel (No Thanks), download, or install the package. Choose “Install” to download and automatically install the module.
 
Magisk will spring into action, downloading your module. Then, it’ll display a terminal window where it’s flashing your device. When it’s finished, you’ll see a Reboot button pop up in the lower-right of your screen. Tap to restart your device.
 
Once your device restarts, your new module will be loaded. Depending on what you picked, it may or may not be obvious. The example used appears as an app on your system.
 
## Updating Modules
 
Magisk Manager also provides the option to update your modules when a new version arrives. If you’ve ever managed custom-flashed modules on Android before, you know that this one is a major lifesaver.
 
Start by opening Magisk Manager again. Just like before, pull out the menu. Return to the “Downloads” section. This time, you’ll see any installed modules at the top of the listing. Any updates will be listed first.
 
Press the download icon next to your module with an available update. Magisk will ask again if you want to install the update.
 
Magisk will get to work downloading and flashing your update. When it’s done, you’ll see the “Reboot” button again. Reboot to apply your update.
 
As you can see, Magisk is a fantastic tool to gain access to some of Android’s most powerful features. With these modules, you can seriously tailor Android to your needs, adding the functionality and extras that you want most.
