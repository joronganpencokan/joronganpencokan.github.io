## Mant Guide in Grounded – Attack Patterns, Weakness & Reward
 

 
Mant is a boss that appears in the Undershed Lab in the game blocking the way to Dr. Wendell Tully. He is the one who created Mant considering it his last hope of escaping his fate. Also, Mant is somehow similar to the Assistant Manager as he can be fought only once. Here’s everything you should do before entering into a fight with Mant in Grounded:
 
### Attack Patterns
 
In order to understand Mant’s attacking strategy, we will break the entire sequence into three stages:
 
- Stage 1 – Upon entering the arena with Mant inside it, he will instantaneously attack you due to his aggressive nature in Grounded. Firstly, he will only display three moves from this arsenal that includes a normal punch from the left, a vicious slam on the ground, and a 3 hit combo of punches.
 - Stage 2 – After reducing his health by almost 25%, he will slam his chest and scream to summon the Fire Worker Ants for help. This time, he uses two additional attacks that include a ranged Spore Bomb attack and 3x explosion attacks from his back.
 - Stage 3 – Thereafter, after reducing his health by almost 50%, he will summon Fire Soldier Ants for his help. The addition in his stage includes incoming web shots from the summoned Ants slowing you down. Meanwhile, Mant will try to hit you with his 3x combo attack. However, this time he may surprise you with a 4th punch in the series.

 
Keep in mind that the explosive attacks from Mant also damage the Ants summoned by him in Grounded.
