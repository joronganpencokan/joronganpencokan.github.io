# Revolutionize Your Music Game: Learn How to Easily Manage iTunes Subscriptions on Your iPhone!

Do you have a Spotify or Apple Music subscription but still use iTunes to manage your music library? If so, you may be missing out on some of the great features that iTunes has to offer. One of these features is the ability to manage your iTunes subscriptions directly from your iPhone. With this feature, you can easily update, cancel, or even download entire albums or playlists at your convenience. 

In this article, we will show you how to manage your iTunes subscriptions on your iPhone and how it can revolutionize your music game!

## Step 1: Open the App Store on your iPhone

The first step to managing your iTunes subscriptions on your iPhone is opening the App Store. Once the App Store is open, you will see a profile icon in the top right corner. Tap on the icon, and it will open up your account.

## Step 2: Access Your iTunes Subscriptions

Once you are in your account, you will see a section called "Subscriptions." Tap on this section, and it will show you all of your current active subscriptions. You can also see expired subscriptions by tapping on the "Expired" tab.

## Step 3: Manage Your Subscriptions

In the subscription section, you will see a list of your active subscriptions. Tap on any subscription to see more details, such as the renewal date and cost. You can also cancel or update your subscription by tapping on the "Cancel Subscription" or "Edit Subscription" buttons. 

If you cancel a subscription, it will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle. You will not be charged for the upcoming billing cycle. If you update a subscription, it will take effect immediately.

## Step 4: Download Entire Albums or Playlists

If you have a subscription to Apple Music or another music streaming service, you can download albums or playlists directly from iTunes. Simply search for the album or playlist you want to download, and tap on the download button. The album or playlist will now be available for offline listening.

## Conclusion

Managing your iTunes subscriptions on your iPhone is easy and can revolutionize your music game. By keeping your subscriptions current, you can discover new music, enjoy exclusive content, and access the latest releases. So what are you waiting for? Start managing your iTunes subscriptions today and take your music game to the next level!

Apple does a lot right, but some of its more nuanced processes, like managing your iTunes subscriptions, can be frustrating to deal with if you don’t know the proper steps. With major streaming services like HBONow/HBOGo and Apple’s own upcoming service only allowing you to manage your subscription directly from your iOS device, it’s important to know how these subscriptions are categorized just in case you want to renew or cancel before your next billing date comes up.
 
## Your Subscription Page
 
To get to the page that manages all your subscriptions, start by opening up your iOS home screen and tap on the “Settings” app.
 

 
Next, tap on the large option at the top of the “Settings” app labeled with your iCloud account name.
 
Tap this and you’ll be taken to the following screen where you’ll need to tap on the “iTunes and App Store” option.
 
From here you’ll be greeted by two screens. The first will be the box asking you to “View Apple ID,” while the next will be for you to type in the verification method you’ve previously set up to get into the account details.
 
This can be anything from the alphanumeric password tied to your iTunes account to FaceID if you’re accessing your subscriptions from an iPhone X and above.
 
On the next screen scroll down until you see the option for “Subscriptions” and tap it.
 
## Manage Your Subscriptions
 
From here you should see a complete list of all the subscriptions tied to your iTunes account, both current and expired.
 
Once you’ve clicked into the subscription of your choosing, you may be presented with multiple options depending on what that particular service provider has on offer. For example, in the case of HBONow, HBO only offers a single monthly subscription plan. This means that when you navigate to the HBONow settings page, your only option for customizing your subscription will be to cancel it altogether. You can achieve this by simply tapping the “Cancel Subscription” button, as shown below.
 
In the case of other services like Scribd, however, which offers multiple plans, including both a monthly and annual option, you’ll have multiple choices. For instance, if you only have a monthly subscription, you can use this screen to upgrade your plan to the full annual subscription.
 
Likewise, you can also downgrade your annual subscription to a monthly or cancel it completely if you don’t want it to renew on the date it says it will expire (as noted by the number shown underneath the subscription term at the top of your screen).
 
## Wrapping Up
 
Despite all the aspects of the iOS experience that are much easier to deal with than what you might find on Android, one area that continues to be frustrating, even with the release of iOS 12, is managing your iTunes subscriptions. Luckily, with this guide you can be sure that none of your subscriptions will accidentally auto-renew without your permission, and you can always prevent free trials from rolling over into paid monthly plans as long as you cancel them in time!
