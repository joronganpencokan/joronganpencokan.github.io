Unlock The Ultimate Halo Experience with Our Exclusive Friend Code - Redeem and Dominate in the Open Beta Now!

Exclusive access to beta versions of video games has become a highly sought-after privilege among gaming enthusiasts. The opportunity to play a game that is yet to be released to the public has the potential to ignite a passion that can propel a gamer to new heights. Moreover, it also provides a chance to showcase one's skillsets before the game is mainstream, which can help build your credibility in the gaming community. Halo fans, rejoice! Microsoft's iconic Halo game series is back with a new game - Halo Infinite - and an open beta is now available. 

What is Halo Infinite, and why is it a big deal?

Halo Infinite is the sixth mainline game in the Halo franchise and the third to be developed by 343 industries. It follows the story of Master Chief, a super-soldier equipped with the latest technology, and his AI Cortana, as they venture through space and time to save humanity from extinction. The game is set in a vast, open-world environment called Zeta Halo, which is full of mystery and challenges.

The game series has garnered tremendous popularity since its inception in 2001. It has sold over 81 million copies worldwide, making it one of the most successful video game franchises in history. The Halo series has defined the FPS (First Person Shooter) genre, with its groundbreaking gameplay, immersive storyline, and multiplayer capabilities.

What makes the Halo Infinite Beta exclusive?

The Halo Infinite open beta allows gamers to experience the game before its official release, providing an exclusive gaming experience that is different from standard gameplay. An open beta is a pre-release test version that is made available to the public. It enables the developers to gather feedback, identify bugs and balance the gameplay before the official launch. The open beta for Halo Infinite provides an opportunity for gamers to play the game, report issues, share feedback, and make suggestions to developers, which can affect the final version.

How can you access the Halo Infinite Beta?

The Halo Infinite beta is available to gamers who have signed up to the Halo Insider program, Microsoft's community-driven program that provides members with exclusive content, offers, and updates. If you have not signed up to the Halo Insider program, it is advisable to do so. The program requires gamers to answer a few survey questions, which are used to identify the ideal players for the beta.

There is a new Open Beta in Halo Infinite that requires you to join with a Friend Code. This process is pretty confusing for many players in the game and has left players stranded. So, scroll down and find out how to redeem and use this Friend Code for the open beta.
 
## How to redeem and use Halo Infinite Friend Code?
 

 
To get access to the Halo Infinite Multiplayer beta you will have to download a specific app. This is the Xbox Insider Hub app, which you will be able to download for free. It is not necessary to join the Halo Insider program to get access to this beta, although, it does help by giving you access to future releases.
 
Once you open the app mentioned above, just join the Halo Infinite Preview. If you took part in some of the previous test betas, you can join the same test servers. Now, for PC users, you will have to use the Friend Code option in Halo Infinite. This is because PC players who were not part of previous tests need to have an access code.
