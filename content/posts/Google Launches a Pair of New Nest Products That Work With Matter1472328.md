Revolutionary New Nest Devices from Google: Get Your Smart Home Game on Point with Matter Compatibility!

Smart home technology has revolutionized the way we live our lives at home, allowing us more convenience, security, and control over our environments. Google, a leader in the smart home space, has announced some exciting new developments that promise to take the game to the next level.

Google's Nest line of devices has been a popular choice for smart home enthusiasts, offering everything from smart thermostats to home security cameras. Now, Google has announced a new lineup of Nest devices that will be compatible with Matter, a new industry standard for smart home devices.

This compatibility with Matter means that the new Nest devices will be able to communicate seamlessly with other Matter-compatible devices from other manufacturers, creating a more unified and interoperable smart home ecosystem. This is a big deal for consumers, as it will eliminate the need to choose between different brands and ecosystems, making it easier to set up and manage a smart home.

So, what are these new Nest devices, and how do they work?

The first is the new Nest Cam (battery), a wire-free outdoor camera that boasts up to 1080p HD video quality, night vision, and a built-in speaker and mic. It also has a handy magnetic mount for easy installation and charging. The Nest Cam (battery) is perfect for those who want to keep an eye on their property without having to run wires or rely on a power source.

Next up is the new Nest Doorbell (battery), another wire-free device that provides 24/7 streaming video and two-way audio. It also features facial recognition, allowing owners to see who's at their door even if they're not home. And with its sleek, weather-resistant design, the Nest Doorbell (battery) is an excellent choice for those who want a smart, wireless doorbell that can stand up to the elements.

Finally, there's the new Nest Learning Thermostat, a device that has been around for a while but has now been updated with Matter compatibility. The thermostat uses machine learning to learn your preferences and adjust the temperature of your home accordingly, helping to save energy and money on your bills. With the new Matter compatibility, the Nest Learning Thermostat will be able to work seamlessly with other smart home devices, allowing you to control your entire home from one app.

The new Nest devices with Matter compatibility are set to be released in the coming months, making it the perfect time to start planning your smart home setup. With these devices, you'll be able to create a unified, interoperable ecosystem that will make your home more efficient, convenient, and secure. So, get your smart home game on point with Nest and Matter!

Google unveiled a suite of new smart home products in its Nest line, including a doorbell and a new router. 

 

These new Nest products have been designed from the ground up to integrate with Matter, the forthcoming smart home communications standard that should (in theory) finally bring all of the competing protocols under one unifying umbrella. In other words, setting up a smart home is about to get easier.

 

The second-generation update to the Hello doorbell is wired, so it does not need frequent recharges, though your home requires pre-existing doorbell wiring. 

 

As expected, the new Nest Doorbell records video and features a 1.3-megapixel color sensor, HDR imaging, a 3:4 aspect ratio for head-to-toe views, and a 145-degree field of view. This camera also features a slimmer profile than its predecessor and is available in four colors. It launches today and costs $180. 

 

The Nest WiFi Pro mesh router system, the company’s entry into the tri-band WiFi 6E arms race, can act as a Matter hub when the protocol launches and can connect 100 devices per node, for a maximum of 300 connected devices.

 

Google says this system will automatically prioritize high-bandwidth traffic for increased efficiency. A Nest three-pack costs $400 and preorders start today with a launch date of October 27. 

 

Google also overhauled its Home app with an emphasis on Matter support among other improvements. You’ll be able to access any connected camera from the app or from the web. There will also be a new script editor to help you create new automations for your connected devices. The update begins rolling out as a Public Preview in the next few weeks.
