One of the most exciting new features in Hitman 3 is the Graffiti locations that challenge the player to find and tag all the elusive yellow bird locations hidden throughout the levels. These rare yellow birds are almost hidden in plain sight, and scouting them all down can take a considerable amount of time.

So, if you're struggling to find all 7 rare yellow birds' graffiti, fear not! This guide will reveal the best-kept secret on how to capture them all in one fell swoop:

## Step 1: Begin at the Correct Level

First and foremost, you must start your journey at the level where you can find all 7 yellow birds. These are the maps that you need to visit to complete the mission:

- Dubai - On Top of the World
- Dartmoor - Death in the Family
- Berlin - Apex Predator
- Chongqing - End of an Era
- Mendoza - The Farewell
- Carpathian Mountains - Untouchable

So, once you have identified these levels, it's time to move on to the next step.

## Step 2: Plan Your Path

Before you begin your mission, take your time to analyze each level's layout and plan your path. Keep in mind that you cannot carry any guns or large items on this mission, so it's important to choose your approach wisely. You can begin with any level, but we recommend you start with Dubai.

## Step 3: The Dubai Level

In Dubai, begin in the Atrium, take immediate right and enter the bathroom. Climb over the railing into the hallway and pass the guard. Then, continue straight ahead and climb the ladder to the third floor. Then, head towards the balcony area and look to your right. The bird will be at the end of the balcony. Take out your camera and snap a picture. 

## Step 4: The Dartmoor Level

In Dartmoor, head to the greenhouse located near the mansion's entrance. Enter the greenhouse through the door facing the mansion and follow the path around to the left. Keep your eyes peeled for a yellow bird painted on the wall on your left. Snap a photo and continue.

## Step 5: The Berlin Level

In Berlin, move towards the biker area and check the wall on the far left of the building. You will find the yellow bird painted on the wall. Capture the picture and move on.

## Step 6: The Chongqing Level

In Chongqing, make your way to the center of the rain-covered streets. There, you will find a bird painted on an electrical box. Take a picture of the bird and move on.

## Step 7: The Mendoza Level

In Mendoza, take note of the red circle drawn in the vineyard area. Enter through the door closest to the red circle and locate the yellow bird painted on the wall straight ahead. Snap a picture and continue.

## Step 8: The Carpathian Mountains Level

In the last level, the Carpathian Mountains, go out the window near the starting point, and drop down to the wooden platform. Crouch, turn right and follow the planks to take you to the seal exhibit entrance. Look up – find the yellow bird on a nearby cliff that overlooks the entire area. Capture the picture and exit the level.

## Conclusion
