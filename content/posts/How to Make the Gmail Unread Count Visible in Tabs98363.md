# You've Been Missing Out! Discover The Secret To Revealing Your Gmail Unread Count In Just A Few Clicks!

For those of us who rely heavily on our Gmail accounts, knowing the number of unread emails we have at any given time is crucial. But did you know that Gmail doesn't show this number by default? That's right - you have to click on each individual label and folder to see how many unread emails you have. But fear not! In this article, we'll reveal the secret to revealing your Gmail unread count in just a few clicks.

## Step 1: Enable the Gmail "Unread Message Icon" Lab

The first step in revealing your Gmail unread count is to enable the "Unread message icon" lab. This lab adds a small red circle with the number of unread emails to the Gmail icon in your Chrome browser tab. Here's how to enable it:

1. Click on the gear icon in the top right corner of your Gmail inbox.

2. Click on "Settings".

3. Click on the "Labs" tab.

4. Scroll down until you find "Unread message icon".

5. Click on "Enable" next to the lab.

6. Click on "Save Changes" at the bottom of the page.

## Step 2: Install the "Checker Plus for Gmail" Chrome Extension

The next step is to install a Chrome extension called "Checker Plus for Gmail". This extension adds a small notification pop-up in the corner of your screen that shows the sender and subject line of new emails as they arrive. Here's how to install it:

1. Open the Chrome Web Store.

2. Search for "Checker Plus for Gmail".

3. Click on "Add to Chrome".

4. Click on "Add extension" in the pop-up that appears.

5. Log in to your Gmail account.

6. Click on the "Checker Plus for Gmail" icon in your Chrome toolbar.

7. Click on "Options".

8. Under "Icon Badge", select "Unread count".

9. Click on "Save options".

## Step 3: Enjoy Your Gmail Unread Count Action

Now that you've enabled the "Unread message icon" lab and installed the "Checker Plus for Gmail" Chrome extension, you can enjoy your Gmail unread count action. The next time you receive a new email, you'll see a small notification pop-up in the corner of your screen that shows the sender and subject line. And every time you open a new Chrome tab, you'll see the number of unread emails in the Gmail icon.

In conclusion, revealing your Gmail unread count is easy and requires just a few clicks. By enabling the "Unread message icon" lab and installing the "Checker Plus for Gmail" Chrome extension, you'll always know how many unread emails you have without having to click on each individual label and folder. So give it a try and start enjoying your Gmail unread count action today!
