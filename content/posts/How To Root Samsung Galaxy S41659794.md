Introduction:

The Samsung Galaxy S4 is a remarkable mobile phone that delivers exceptional user experience. Powered by Android, it offers a wide range of features that are easy to navigate, intuitive, and user-friendly. However, despite all its benefits, some users find that they cannot unlock the full potential of their Galaxy S4 because of the limitations set by the manufacturer. Rooting the phone is the key to unlocking its true potential, and this article will show you how to do it.

Section 1 - Understanding Rooting:

Rooting refers to the process of unlocking the operating system of your Android device, so you can access and modify every aspect of it. By doing so, you can install custom ROMs, remove bloatware, and tweak your device's settings to enhance its performance, battery life, and overall functionality. This process can seem daunting, primarily if you have little to no knowledge of coding or software development. However, it is important to note that rooting can void your phone's warranty, and mistakes can render your device useless.

Section 2 - The Ultimate Rooting Hack for the Samsung Galaxy S4:

To root your Samsung Galaxy S4, you will need to download and install a rooting application or software. One of the most popular rooting software for Samsung phones is CF-Auto-Root, which has been developed specifically for this purpose. Here's how to use it:

Step 1: Download the CF-Auto-Root.zip file for your Samsung Galaxy S4 model and extract it to your computer.

Step 2: Enable "USB Debugging" mode on your Galaxy S4. Go to "Settings > Developer Options" and check the "USB Debugging" box.

Step 3: Connect your phone to your computer using a USB cable.

Step 4: Open Odin software on your computer and click on the "AP" button.

Step 5: Select the extracted CF-Auto-Root.tar file.

Step 6: Click on the "Start" button to begin the rooting process.

Step 7: Wait for the software to complete the rooting process. Your Samsung Galaxy S4 will reboot and switch on, and you should now see the SuperSU app on your phone.

Section 3 - Benefits of Rooting Your Samsung Galaxy S4:

Once you have the CF-Auto-Root software installed, you can now enjoy the many benefits that come with rooting your Samsung Galaxy S4. Here are some of the key advantages:

1. Customization: You can customize your device in many ways, from installing custom ROMs to changing the appearance of your device.

2. Improved Performance: You can remove bloatware and apps that slow down your phone, freeing up memory and storage and thereby, improving its performance.

3. Increased Battery Life: You can remove power-hungry apps that drain your battery and also use tools like Greenify to improve battery life.

4. New Features: You can add new features that are not available on the manufacturer's version of Android, such as NFC hacks and network-tethering support.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, rooting your Samsung Galaxy S4 is easy and can be done in just a few steps. By doing so, you can unleash the true potential of your device, enjoy better performance, increased battery life, and new features that are not available in the default version of Android. However, before rooting, it is important to read up thoroughly and take necessary precautions such as backing up your data and following the steps carefully to protect your device.

Samsung might not be a developer community favorite, but gaining root access on its devices has been particularly easy. However, with the Galaxy S4 things are a bit different this time. Gaining root access on the Exynos 5 Octa variant of the Galaxy S4 (I9500) has proven particularly tricky for developers. On the other hand, rooting the Qualcomm (I9505) variant is pretty straight forward and involves the use of ODIN.
Luckily, since the Exynos 5 Octa variant is being sold only in limited non-LTE markets, so chances are you must be owning the Qualcomm (I9505) variant of the Galaxy S4. So, if you are looking to gain root access on your SGS4, here is how you can do so in five simple steps -:
Keep in mind that the steps below are only for the I9505 or the Qualcomm variant of the Galaxy S4. Do not play around with the settings in ODIN. Let everything remain as it is.

 

Download ODIN, CF-Auto Root from Chainfire and the required drivers. Install the drivers, and extract the contents of the CF-Auto Root zip file inside a new folder on your desktop. The file you will extract from the zip file will have a .tar extension. Do not extract the contents of the tar file.
Fire up ODIN, and click on the PDA button. Then navigate to the new folder on your desktop that contains the tar file that you extracted from the CF-Auto Root zip file in Step 1.  
Switch off your Galaxy S4. Now, you need to put it in ‘Download’ mode by pressing the Volume Down + Home + Power button simultaneously. You will get a warning saying that using a custom OS will harm your device etc., which you can skip by pressing the Volume up button. 
Connect your S4 to your PC now. Once the drivers are automatically installed, ODIN will detect your phone and display a random COM No. Click on the ‘Start’ button and now wait for ODIN to flash CF-Auto-Root. The whole procedure should not take more than 30 seconds.
Once the flashing procedure is completed, your phone will automatically reboot.



You have now successfully managed to gain root access on your Galaxy S4. Keep in mind that CF-Auto-Root does not install a custom recovery, so you cannot flash any custom kernel or any mods. Installing a custom recovery is very easy, and you just need to use ROM Manager or the Goo.im app to install either CWM or TWRP recovery on your Galaxy S4.
Thanks to Chainfire for all his hard work!
