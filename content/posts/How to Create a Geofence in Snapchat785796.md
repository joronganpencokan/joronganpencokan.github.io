Unlock the Secret to Dominating Your Local Snapchat Scene: Learn How to Create a Geofence Now!

Snapchat, a social media application known for its temporary nature, has taken the world by storm with its unique features. One such feature is Geofencing. Geofencing is a location-based service that enables marketers to send location-specific messages to consumers using a unique geographic boundary. Geofencing is an efficient tool used by businesses to enhance their local marketing strategy. Learn how to create a geofence and unlock the secret to dominating your local Snapchat scene.

What is Geofencing?

Geofencing is a location-based service that enables marketers to send location-specific messages to consumers using a unique geographic boundary. It uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to establish a virtual boundary around a physical location. Geofencing delivers targeted information to the audience based on their location, in turn, increasing engagement, traffic, and sales.

Benefits of Geofencing

1. Increased Engagement: Geofencing helps businesses to connect with their customers in real-time, delivering personalized content to the right audience at the right time. This leads to increased engagement and better engagement metrics.

2. Better Targeting: Geofencing allows businesses to target a specific audience based on location, interest, and demographics. This ensures that the marketing message is delivered to the right people, increasing the chances of conversions.

3. Increased Sales: Geofenced ads have a higher conversion rate, leading to increased sales for businesses. The personalized message delivered to the audience leads to better engagement and trust-building, ultimately resulting in sales.

Creating a Geofence on Snapchat

Creating a Geofence on Snapchat is easy and quick. Follow the steps below to create a Geofence on Snapchat:

Step 1: Login to your Snapchat account and select "Create an ad."

Step 2: Select the "Geofilter" option and choose "On-Demand Geofilters."

Step 3: Select the location you want to target. You can type in the name of the location, draw a fence around it, or enter the address.

Step 5: Set your budget and duration of the Geofilter.

This article explains how to create a geofence in Snapchat on the web or using the mobile app for Android and iOS.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Go to Snapchat.com/Create and upload your filter. When you set your location, enter an address, and then select Draw Fence.
 - In the Snapchat app, upload a filter. When you set your location, tap and hold the corners of the default geofence to drag it into place.
 - The filter must be a minimum of 20,000 square feet and a maximum of 50,000 square feet.

 
##   How to Create a Geofence on the Web  
 

The following steps will walk you through the process of creating your filter and corresponding geofence via Snapchat.com in a web browser.

 
- Go to Snapchat.com/Create in a web browser and select Get Started > Filters.
 - Upload or design your filter.
 - Select Next to choose your dates, and then select Next again to set your location.
 - To create your geofence, use the field at the top to type an address and select the correct one from the drop-down list.
 - If your location doesn't have a specific address, enter an address that's close to it, and then use the cursor to drag the map around to the correct location.
 - Select Draw Fence to the right of the location field.
 - Click a spot on the map to drop your first point, and then click somewhere else to drop another one. Each circular point will connect to the last (like a "connect the dots" game). You can continue with as many circular points as you want until you arrive back at the first one to enclose the geofence.
 - To customize your geofence even further, select any one of the eight white circular points on the corners and along the sides of the default square geofence to expand, contract, or reshape it by dragging them into place. You can also select Reset Fence in the location field to start over.
 - Select Checkout in the lower-right corner to purchase your new filter and geofence.

 
##   How to Create a Geofence on the App  
 

Since you can create filters within the Snapchat app, you can also use that platform to set their corresponding geofences.

 

Go to Snapchat.com/Create in a web browser and select Get Started > Filters.

 

Upload or design your filter.

 

Select Next to choose your dates, and then select Next again to set your location.

 

To create your geofence, use the field at the top to type an address and select the correct one from the drop-down list.

 
If your location doesn't have a specific address, enter an address that's close to it, and then use the cursor to drag the map around to the correct location.

##   How Snapchat Geofences Work  
 

A geofence is a virtual enclosure on Snapchat's Snap Map. Its purpose is to tell Snapchat exactly where, geographically, a filter can be used.

 

Open the Snapchat app and tap your profile/Bitmoji icon in the upper-left corner.

 

Select the gear icon in the upper-right corner.

 

Select Filters & Lenses > Get Started! > Filter and create the filter by following the steps provided.

 

When you're happy with your filter design, select the green checkmark in the lower-right corner.

 

Select the dates for your filter to go live, then select the green Continue button to move onto your geofence.

 

Once you've arrived at the location setting tab, you should see the default square geofence surrounding your current location on a map.

 

If the location for your filter is different from your current one, use the field at the top to type in a location and select it from the drop-down list.

 

Tap and hold one of the white circular points on the default geofence to drag it into place.

 
Unlike creating geofences on the web, you only have four corners to work with, and you can't draw your geofence from scratch.
 

When you're happy with your geofence, select the green Continue button to make your purchase.

 

When you create your own Snapchat filter on the web or on the app, you receive a default geofence at your chosen location after entering enter a specific address into the location field. You can customize your existing default geofence or draw it from scratch so that it includes (or excludes) other surrounding areas that you decide. You do this when you get to the location-setting step of the filter making process.

 
##   Why Use a Geofence for Your Snapchat Filter?  
 

A properly drawn geofence can help more of the right people gain access to your filter. If you run a business or organization and use a filter to help promote one of your events, the exposure it gets will depend on your geofence.

 

Snapchat users who are snapping from within the boundaries of your geofence might use your filter on their snaps and potentially post them as stories, meaning that you'll get more exposure from their viewers. And if someone decides to create a Geostory (which is a public collection of stories at a specific location) from your geofenced location, it will encourage others to add their own stories too – perhaps with your filter!

 
##   Things to Keep in Mind When Creating Your Geofence  
 
- Your filter must be a minimum of 20,000 square feet and can only be a maximum of 50,000 square feet. If you're under or over, your geofence will turn red and a warning will appear at the bottom or top of the screen.Avoid using too many circular points or creating a shape with thin areas to help ensure proper coverage.The cost of your filter can change depending on how you draw your geofence. Geofences that cover popular areas tend to be more expensive.Snapchat doesn't provide a reviewal timeline for purchased filters, but you'll receive an email once you have approval.
