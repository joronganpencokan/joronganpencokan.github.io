# Revolutionize Your Debian Game: Learn How to Create a Custom Live CD in Minutes with This Web-Based Hack!

If you're a Linux user, you're probably familiar with Debian, one of the oldest and most popular Linux distributions around. Debian is known for its stability, security, and ease of use. For those who want to customize their Debian installation, there are plenty of options available. However, creating a custom Live CD can be a daunting task, especially for beginners.

Fortunately, there is a web-based hack that can help you create a custom Debian Live CD in minutes. This hack is called "Debian Live Build", and it's a tool that automates the process of creating a customized Live CD.

In this article, we'll walk you through the process of using Debian Live Build to create a custom Debian Live CD.

# Requirements

Before we get started, there are a few things you'll need:

- A Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, Mint)
- The Debian Live Build package
- A basic knowledge of the Linux command line

# Step 1: Install Debian Live Build

The first thing you'll need to do is install Debian Live Build. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install live-build
```

This will install Debian Live Build on your system.

# Step 2: Create a Configuration File

The next step is to create a configuration file. This tells Debian Live Build what packages to include in your custom Live CD, how to configure the system, and other settings.

You can create a configuration file by running the following command in your terminal:

```
lb config
```

This will create a default configuration file in the current directory.

# Step 3: Customize Your Configuration

Now it's time to customize your configuration file. You can open it in a text editor and make changes as needed.

Here are a few things you might want to customize:

- Packages: You can specify which packages to include in your custom Live CD by adding them to the "packages" section of your configuration file.
- Boot loader: You can choose which boot loader to use (e.g. Grub, Syslinux).
- Background: You can change the background image of your Live CD by adding a custom image to the "binary" directory of your configuration file.

# Step 4: Build Your Live CD

Once you're happy with your configuration file, it's time to build your Live CD. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
sudo lb build
```

This will start the build process, which may take several minutes depending on your system.

# Step 5: Test Your Live CD

Once the build process is complete, you should have a custom Debian Live CD in the "binary" directory of your configuration file.

You can test it by booting from the CD or by using a virtual machine.

Congratulations, you've successfully created a custom Debian Live CD!

# Conclusion

Creating a custom Debian Live CD can be a valuable tool for system administrators, developers, and other Linux users. With Debian Live Build, the process is quicker and easier than ever before.

By following the steps in this article, you can create a custom Debian Live CD in minutes. So why not give it a try and see what kind of customized system you can come up with?

If Debian means one thing, it’s functionality. You typically don’t go to Debian for cutting-edge features or fancy bells and whistles, but if you’re after an extremely versatile, stable, and dependable Linux, it can’t be beat. One of Debian’s newer offerings is the ability to create a custom Live CD directly from their website. You choose your options, they generate the image.  Like all things Debian, it’s not flashy, you’ll get no AJAX animations or jQuery effects, just a functional, flexible, and powerful tool, and here’s how to use it.

 
### Basic Settings
 
Click here to open the Web Image Builder. By default it will only show the basic options for building your CD.  
 

 
binary-images specifies the type of image you wish to generate. Under most circumstances, you’ll want to leave that at the standard ISO CD format.  
 
Under distribution, you choose which release of Debian to use for the install. In short, Debian always has three releases available – stable, testing, and unstable. The current stable release is codenamed Lenny and the current testing is Squeeze. Unstable is always Sid. For maximum dependability choose Lenny (stable), but historically the testing branch functions quite well as a desktop.  
 
The packages-lists option provides a simple way to select from a predefined group of packages. For example, if you want to run a home studio in KDE, there just so happens to be a studio-kde package.  
 
Presumably, the tasks section allows you to specify certain tasks for the build, however this feature seems to be almost entirely undocumented, which is rare with Debian tools.  
 
packages is a list of the packages you wish to include in your CD that are not part of the lists you selected previously. This can include anything in the Debian repositories, from media players like VLC to recovery tools like gparted.  
 
### Advanced Bootstrap Options
 
If all we could set was the basic options, this utility wouldn’t be especially useful. The next section of config, which can be accessed by clicking Advanced Bootstrap Options, gives us a few more important settings.  
 
Currently the architecture option only provides 386 style processors. This is a broad architecture, as compared to the likes of SPARC or PowerPC. You’ll set more a specific CPU type (686, 64-bit, etc) in a later section.  
 
bootstrap-flavour is referring to the packages that will be involved in building the base system. Unless you’re trying to make your CD image particularly tiny, you’ll probably want to leave this at standard.  
 
Leave mirror-bootstrap alone, as that will grab packages right from the build server, but you may want to set mirror-binary to your region. Users in the Unites States, for example, may wish to change http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ to http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/.  
 
mirror-binary-security can be safely left alone, but if you intend to use non-open software (Flash, Skype, etc) you’ll want to change archive-areas to include “contrib” and “non-free”.  
 
### Advanced Chroot Options
 
As promised, this is the section where you can define a more specific CPU architecture, as well as some other handy options.  
 
When chroot-filesystem is set to squashfs, the files on your live CD will be compressed, giving you more space for applications. Generally this is what you want.  
 
linux-flavours is where you can define your CPU architecture in more detail. Listed in the combo box are all supported 386-style CPU types, including images designed for virtual machines.  
 
Strangely, security and symlinks seem to be two more largely undocumented features. Some limited testing indicates security may be related to SELinux configuration.  
 
With sysvinit, you can decide whether or not you want to use the somewhat deprecated SysV Init system. Unless you have a particular reason to use it, and you’d probably know if you did, leave this setting at False.  
 
### Advanced Binary Options
 
As most of the options here are on the more technical side and do not require adjustment under normal circumstances, this section will focus most on the options a user is most likely to wish to change.  
 
bootloader will let you choose between syslinux and GRUB. Syslinux is simpler and is the standard bootloader for Live CDs, but GRUB can provide more options. Unless you have a reason to use GRUB, Syslinux is the safest and simplest choice.  
 
The debian-installer option is where you decide whether or not you’d like to support installation from your live media. According to the Debian Live team, this isn’t exactly in the spirit of the system (an official Debian install CD may be a better choice), but is supported nonetheless.  
 
If you want the contents of your CD encrypted, you can simply set the encryption flag to the desired level of encryption.  
 
### Advanced Source Options
 
There are only two options here, source and source-images. The former is the decision on whether or not to include source code in your CD, and the latter is the format in which it will be stored.  
 
### Conclusion
 
When you’ve finished your CD, the server will take a few minutes to build your image and notify you via email when it’s ready for download. As usual, the Debian developers have come up with a useful tool to get the job done. Will it win any Beautiful Web Site awards? Probably not. Will it build a custom Debian live CD to your specifications?  Absolutely.
