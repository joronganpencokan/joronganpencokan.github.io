# Revolutionary! Google Introduces Game-Changing Feature to Streamline Tab Sharing - You Won't Believe Your Eyes!

Google is known for its innovative approach to technology and providing its users with the most efficient tools and features. It has now taken another step towards transforming our online experience with its latest feature to streamline tab sharing. This game-changing feature will make tab sharing an effortless and hassle-free experience, giving users a seamless workflow that other browsers will find hard to match.

The new feature is called "Tab Groups" and works by grouping tabs in a single tab that shares a common label. When you open a new tab, you can label it, so it is added to an existing group of tabs with the same label. For example, you can group all your work-related tabs under the label 'work' or all your entertainment tabs under the label 'fun.' Once your tabs are organized, you can share them quickly by clicking the share icon, located next to each Tab Group.

Google's Tab Groups feature comes in handy when you need to segment your work or leisure activities into separate groups of tabs. Instead of rummaging through a pile of opened tabs to find the one relevant to your current task, you can label and group them for easy referencing. The feature is especially beneficial for users who frequently switch between multiple tasks or screens, as it eliminates the need to search through long lists of tabs, making workflow smoother and more productive.

The Tab Groups feature is available in the latest version of Google Chrome (81) and is very easy to use. To start using the feature, all you need to do is right-click on a tab, choose "Add to new tab group," and then name the group. You can add more tabs to the same group by dragging and dropping them into it. The feature is customizable, so you can easily rename or delete a group by clicking on the group name and selecting the appropriate option from the menu.

In conclusion, Google's innovative approach to technology has once again revolutionized the way we work online. The Tab Groups feature provides an easy and efficient way to streamline tab sharing and makes it a hassle-free experience. Users who often switch between multiple tasks or screens will find this feature very beneficial as it eliminates the need to search through a pile of opened tabs to find what they need. With Google's Tab Groups, tab sharing has become more manageable and user-friendly.

Google is improving Chrome's "Send Tab to Self" function, which you can try out for yourself through the latest in-development build of Canary.

 

Reddit user Leopeva64 spotted the change tucked away in the latest developer build of Canary. If you use Canary, you can enable Send Tab to Self 2.0 by typing or pasting chrome://flags/#send-tab-to-self-v2 into the bar at the top, then setting it to Enabled. This changes the way tabs are shared across platforms, replacing system notifications with a small icon that will appear next to the address bar.

 

As Android Police points out, the move away from notifications is far less intrusive as it takes system pop-ups out of the process entirely. It also works independently of your system notification settings, so even if notifications are disabled for Chrome the new sharing function will still work. Additionally, this prevents the shared tab from being hidden under other notifications that may appearâ€”keeping the information set to the side and safe until you decide to pull it up.

 

Send Tab to Self 2.0 also is coming to Chrome's mobile browser, though the functionality is slightly different compared to the desktop. The mobile version still uses notifications, however, they're tied to the app and won't pop up until you open Chrome on your device. Once the notification bar appears, you'll have a few seconds to tap in before it disappears.

 

You can download Canary to test out Send Tab to Self 2.0, but be aware that it's primarily intended as a testbed for Google and third-party developers, and is not meant for day-to-day use.
