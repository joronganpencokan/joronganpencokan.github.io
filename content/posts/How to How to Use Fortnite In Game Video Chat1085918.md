# Revolutionize Your Fortnite Gameplay with In-Game Video Chat - Check Out Our Step-by-Step Guide Now!

Fortnite is one of the hottest multiplayer games on the market right now. Millions of people around the world are logging in every day to compete against each other in battle royale mode, build their own islands in creative mode, and complete challenges in save the world mode.

While the game is incredibly fun to play, it can also be a bit frustrating to communicate with your teammates during gameplay. Trying to type messages quickly during intense battles can be distracting and disorienting, and voice chat systems can sometimes be laggy, unreliable, or just downright awkward to use.

That's why we're excited to share with you a revolutionary new way to communicate with your teammates in Fortnite: in-game video chat! This game-changing feature allows you to see and hear your teammates in real-time as you play, making it easier than ever to coordinate strategies, share tips and tricks, and have a blast with your friends.

In this article, we'll walk you through the steps for setting up in-game video chat in Fortnite, so you can start enjoying this amazing new feature today. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Download and Install Discord

Discord is a free voice and text chat app that's popular among gamers worldwide. It's easy to use, reliable, and has loads of features that make it a great choice for communicating with your teammates in Fortnite.

To get started, head to the Discord website and download the app for your device. Install it and sign up for an account if you haven't already done so.

## Step 2: Add Discord Friends

Once you have Discord installed, it's time to add your Fortnite teammates to your friends list. To do this, simply click on the Friends icon in the bottom left corner of the Discord app and click the "Add Friend" button.

Enter your friend's username or Discord tag, and they'll receive a friend request. Once they accept it, you'll be able to communicate with them via voice or text chat.

## Step 3: Link Your Discord Account to Fortnite

Now that you're connected to your Fortnite friends on Discord, it's time to link your Discord account to your Fortnite account. This will allow you to use in-game video chat during gameplay.

To do this, open Fortnite and go to the settings menu. Click on the "Audio" tab and scroll down to the "Voice Chat" section. Click on the "Enable Voice Chat" button, and then scroll down to the "Input Device" section. Select "Discord" from the drop-down list.

Now, open up Discord again and click on the gear icon next to your username. Select "Connections" from the list and scroll down to the "Fortnite" section. Click the "Connect" button and follow the prompts to link your Discord and Fortnite accounts.

## Step 4: Start a Video Chat in Fortnite

With your Discord and Fortnite accounts linked, you're now ready to start a video chat with your friends during gameplay.

To do this, simply click on the "Push to Talk" button in Fortnite (usually default to "V" on your keyboard). This will activate your microphone and allow you to speak.

To start a video chat, simply click on the "Video" button in Discord when you're in a voice chat with your Fortnite friends. This will allow you to see and hear each other in real-time during gameplay, making it easier than ever to coordinate your movements and strategies.

And that's it! By following these simple steps, you can revolutionize your Fortnite gameplay with in-game video chat. Give it a try today and see how it can change the way you play the game!

##   How Does Fortnite In-Game Video Chat Work?  
 

Fortnite voice chat and in-game video chat both use Epic’s Houseparty app to enable cross-platform chat. That’s why you need to sign up for Houseparty and link it with your Epic account. The benefit is that it allows you to video chat with your Epic Games friends in Fortnite regardless of whether you are playing on PC or PlayStation. Friends on unsupported platforms can’t video chat with you in-game, but they can still join in on their phone with the Houseparty app.

 

Install and open the Houseparty app on your phone or tablet.

 

Tap Sign Up.

 

Enter your details, tap Next, and finish creating a Houseparty account.

 
Before proceeding any further in the Houseparty app, you need to make sure Houseparty is enabled in Fortnite. If it isn't, the app will give you an error when you try to connect.
 

Launch Fortnite on your PC or PlayStation, and open the menu by clicking the menu icon (PC) or pressing the Options button on your controller (PlayStation).

 

Select Settings.

 

Navigate to the Sound tab (speaker icon).

 

In the Voice Chat section, make sure that Voice Chat is set to On, Voice Channel is set to Party, and Houseparty Video Chat Integration is set to On.

 

If parental controls are enabled, make sure that Houseparty Video Chat in Fortnite is set to On.

 

Back in the Houseparty app on your iOS or Android device, tap Connect Fortnite.

 

Tap Agree.

 
If you perform this step before turning on Houseparty video chat in the Fortnite settings, you won't be able to finish the process of connecting Fortnite. You will have to enable that setting and then connect Fortnite to the Houseparty app later.
 

Tap Sign in with Epic games.

 

Enter your Epic Games info and tap Log in now.

 

Tap Allow.

 

Tap Camera and Mic, and tap Next.

 
If your phone asks for camera and mic permission after this step, grant it.
 

Tap the TV icon.

 

Position your phone so the camera is pointed at your face.

 
If the phone camera can’t capture your face, your friends won’t be able to see you in Fortnite video chat.
 

Tap the F slider in the Fortnite Mode dropdown.

 

Tap the hand icon, and Invite your friends to party up or join their party. If they're also using Houseparty, you'll see their faces on the left side of your screen while partied up in Fortnite.

 

When you set up the Houseparty app and connect it to Fortnite, your phone sends a live video of your face to Houseparty on your friends’ phones, which forwards the video to Fortnite on their PC or PlayStation. It works the same in reverse: Video of their faces transmit to your Houseparty app and then to Fortnite on your PC or PlayStation.

 

For this whole process to work, you need to either disable Fortnite parental controls or enable Houseparty video chat in the parental controls. Houseparty has some built-in safety features, like only allowing your kids to video chat with their friends and preventing people they chat with from seeing your kid’s surroundings. It accomplishes this by recognizing your face and automatically replacing everything else with a colorful background. If the app doesn’t detect your face for any reason, like standing up or walking away, your entire broadcast is instead a colorful background.

 
##   How to Control Fortnite In-Game Chat  
 

While Fortnite in-game video chat allows you to see your friends on the side of the screen while playing the game, you control it through the Houseparty app on your phone. The app displays the same video feeds of your friends that you see in-game, and it provides some useful options.

 
Parents can disable Houseparty video chat through Fortnite parental controls. You aren’t allowed to make a Houseparty account if you aren’t at least 13 years old, so keep that in mind.
 

By default, total strangers aren’t able to enter your video chat or see your video. Your Houseparty friends, who are by default just your Fortnite friends, can join, and so can their friends. Nobody else can get in.

 

If you want to chat with your friends, or even just one or two specific friends, you can also lock your video chat to prevent others from joining. To accomplish this, tap the Lock icon at the bottom of the Houseparty screen while you’re in a video chat.

 

You can also block people who have already joined that chat, which turns off their video and prevents them from seeing your video. If a friend of one of your friends joined and is causing trouble, this is a valuable feature. Just tap the person’s face in the Houseparty app, and tap Block. 

 

If someone is causing trouble with obscene content or harassment in Fortnite video chat, you can also report them in-game. Just open the Fortnite settings menu, then navigate to Settings > Reporting/Feedback > Report A Player. When you finish reporting, you can choose to block the player from joining your chat or party in the future.
