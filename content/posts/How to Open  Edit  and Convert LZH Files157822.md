Are you tired of downloading or receiving compressed Lzh files and not being able to open them? Don't worry; you're not alone! Fortunately, learning how to unlock the secrets of Lzh files is easier than you might think.

These simple hacks will provide you with the necessary skills to unzip Lzh files quickly and easily. Here's how:

## What are Lzh files?

Lzh files are a type of compressed file archive format similar to Zip files. They contain one or more files that have been compressed and packaged into a single file.

This type of file format is common in Japan, where it's widely used for archiving and compressing files. So, if you receive a file with an ".lzh" extension, it's most likely from a Japanese source.

## How to unzip an Lzh file?

To unzip an Lzh file, you need to use a tool that supports the Lzh format. Here are some tools you can use:

### 1. 7-Zip

7-Zip is a free open-source tool that supports multiple compression formats, including Lzh. To extract Lzh files with 7-zip, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the Lzh file you want to extract.
2. Hover your mouse over the "7-zip" option in the context menu.
3. Choose "Extract files..." from the submenu that appears.
4. Select the destination folder where you want to extract the files.
5. Click the "OK" button.

### 2. WinRAR

WinRAR is another popular archiving tool that supports Lzh files. Here's how to extract Lzh files using WinRAR:

1. Right-click on the Lzh file you want to extract.
2. Hover your mouse over the "WinRAR" option in the context menu.
3. Choose "Extract files..." from the submenu that appears.
4. Choose the destination folder where you want to extract the files.
5. Click the "OK" button.

By following these simple steps, you can easily extract the contents of an Lzh file to your desired folder.

## Simple Hacks to extract passwords from Lzh files

If the Lzh file you want to extract is password-protected, then you will need to use a password to open it. Here are some hacks you can use to extract passwords from Lzh files:

### 1. Using LZHpwd

LZHpwd is a small tool that can help you extract passwords from Lzh files. Here's how:

1. Download the LZHpwd tool from the internet.
2. Install the tool on your computer.
3. Open the LZHpwd tool.
4. Drag the password-protected Lzh file into the tool.
5. The tool will display the extracted password for the file.

### 2. Using Lzhcrack

Lzhcrack is a more advanced tool for extracting passwords from Lzh files. Here's how:

1. Download Lzhcrack from the internet.
2. Extract the tool to your desired folder.
3. Run the Lzhcrack tool.
4. Load the password-protected Lzh file into the tool.
5. Wait for the tool to extract the password.

Conclusion

In conclusion, unlocking the secrets of Lzh files is not rocket science. You only need the right tool to extract and decompress the files quickly and easily. With the simple hacks shared in this article, you can now unzip and extract passwords from Lzh files without breaking a sweat.

So, the next time you receive an Lzh file, don't panic. Put these hacks into practice, and you will be a master of Lzh files in no time.

This article explains what an LZH file is and how to open or convert one.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- An LZH file is an LZH Compressed file.Open an LZH file with 7-Zip, PeaZip, or some other file unzip tool.Convert the files inside the archive with a file converter.

 
##   What Is an LZH File?  
 

A file with the LZH file extension is an LZH Compressed file that's been compressed with the Lempel-Ziv and Haruyasu algorithm, which are the names of the algorithm's inventors.

 

The format is popular in Japan but not really anywhere else. It's been used to compress video game installation files, like those in id Software's Doom and Quake, as well as used as the archive format in the Amiga computer.

 

LZH files are like other compression formats (e.g., ZIP, 7Z, RAR) in that their purpose is twofold: reduce the size of files and hold multiple files together in one single archive.

 
##   How to Open an LZH File  
 

Japanese versions of the Windows operating system include an add-on to natively support LZH files without having to use any extra software. But if you're running a non-Japanese version, you can still open the LZH file using third-party software.

 
This format has basically replaced the original LHARC Compressed Archive (.LHA) format—previously named LHarc and then LH—that it was originally based on.
 

We know of several programs that can do this. Our favorites are 7-Zip and PeaZip, (which both support the LHA format too), but there are others out there, too.

 

You should also be able to open one on non-Japanese Windows installs without these programs, so long as you install the add-on called Microsoft Compressed (LZH) Folder Add-on. You can get this through Windows Update with the Japanese language pack, but you must be using an Enterprise or Ultimate version of Windows 7 to do this.

 
##   How to Convert an LZH File  
 

It's rarely a necessary task to convert an archive file format like LZH to another type of archive because it's unlikely that you want to save the actual archive, as a whole, to another format. It's more likely that there's a file inside the archive that you want to be in a different format.

 
If you find that an application on your PC does try to open the file, but it's the wrong application or you'd rather have another installed program open it, you can change the default program that opens LZH files.
 

Maybe you have some PDFs inside the archive, for example, in which case converting the entire LZH file to some other archive format wouldn't accomplish much. What you'd want to do instead is extract the PDFs out of the archive and then convert those files. In this instance, you'd use a document file converter, but other types exist, too, for videos, images, etc.

 

However, we do know of a couple converters that can save the LZH file to a similar format like ZIP, 7Z, CAB, TAR, YZ1, GZIP, BZIP2, TBZ, etc. Just remember that doing this does not convert the files inside (which is likely what you want to do), but instead just converts the archive file itself.

 

FileZigZag and Zamzar are two online file converters that can do this. With these tools, you have to first upload the file to one of those websites before you can convert it, after which you have to then download the file back to your computer before you can use it.

 
##   Still Can't Open It?  
 

Remember that in order to access a file inside the archive, you have to extract it out first. Most image viewers, for example, don't let you open a JPG file if it's inside an LZH file. To make it work, you need to get the image out of the archive first so that it's by itself. It's only then that your average image file opener will recognize the format.

 

The next likely reason for why you can't open it is because you're mixing it up with another file that uses a similar file extension. There are several examples of this with all kinds of files, not just ones that end with LZH. When you try this, you'll get an error because the program you're trying to use isn't compatible with that specific file format.

 

For example, LHZD is an extension that looks similar, but it's actually reserved for Live Home 3D compressed project files. In this case, you need Live Home 3D installed on your computer before that file will open.

 

Another example is the Need for Speed game data archive format. These files end in LZC, and while they are archives, you probably need a very specific app to open them, like SpeedReflect Binary.
