Codemasters has been a major player in the gaming industry for decades, and the company has built a reputation for delivering high-quality games that are engaging and immersive experiences for gamers. While the delay of Grid may be disappointing to fans, the company's decision to delay the release for a month shows that it is committed to delivering an excellent gaming experience and one that will not disappoint.

In conclusion, the delay of Grid is a massive blow for fans of the franchise who were eagerly waiting for its release. However, the decision by Codemasters to prioritize quality over a rushed release shows its commitment to providing gamers with the best possible experience.
