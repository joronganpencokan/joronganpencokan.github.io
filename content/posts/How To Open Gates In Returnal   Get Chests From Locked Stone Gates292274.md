Unlock the Mystery: Discover the Secret Technique to Open Locked Stone Gates and Claim Rare Chests in Returnal!

Returnal is a fascinating game that revolves around Selene, an astronaut stranded on an alien planet that she cannot escape from. The game has garnered a lot of attention for its unique gameplay mechanics, top-notch graphics, and epic storyline. One of the most intriguing aspects of the game is the presence of locked stone gates that prevent players from accessing rare chests full of upgrades and weapons. In this article, we will uncover the secret technique to open these gates and claim the riches beyond.

First things first, it's important to note that not all stone gates can be opened in Returnal. Some gates are simply there for decoy purposes, and there is no way to unlock them. However, the game cleverly differentiates these decoy gates from the real ones by the presence of symbols on the lock mechanism.

The symbols on the lock mechanism indicate the type of key you need to open the gate. There are four different symbols to look out for - triangle, square, circle, and star. Each symbol corresponds to a different type of key that you need to unlock the gate.

Now, the real question is, where do you find these keys? The answer is simple - exploration! Returnal is a game that rewards exploration, and you can find keys in hidden rooms and tunnels scattered throughout the game's environments. These rooms are usually hidden behind breakable walls or locked doors that you need a different key to unlock.

Once you have obtained the correct key for the lock mechanism, approach the gate and interact with it. Selene will insert the key into the lock, and you will hear a satisfying click sound, indicating that the gate has been unlocked. Voila! Now you can claim the rare chest inside containing valuable upgrades and weapons to aid you on your journey.

Exploration is key in Returnal, and finding these keys to unlock the gates is essential to progress through the game. It's important to note that the chests inside these gates contain some of the rarest and most powerful upgrades in the game, so it's definitely worth the effort.

In conclusion, unlocking the mystery behind the stone gates in Returnal is an essential aspect of the game that will allow you to access rare chests full of valuable upgrades and weapons. By following the simple steps mentioned above, you should now be able to open these gates and claim the riches beyond. Happy exploring!

## How to Open Stone Gates in Returnal?
 
When you find yourself in front of a Stone Gate in Returnal, you have to look for a switch which has a yellow light. Your task is to find this switch which can be anywhere near the door.

Head towards the open Gate and collect the items that were locked behind it. This is what you need to do to open every Stone Gate and you will be able to access various items behind them.
 
Speaking of gates and doors, there’s a door not opening bug that is causing frustration among many players. It is creating a roadblock in the progression because you aren’t able to interact with any door. Know that the developers are aware of this problem. The possible fix until they release a patch is to use the standard suit for Selene and not the pre-order suit. Another option is to restart but that means losing your progress. So if you haven’t got this door glitch yet, avoid it by switching to the default skin.
