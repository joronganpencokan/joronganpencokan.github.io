Disney Dreamlight Valley has a secret recipe to make the most delectable biscuits that you will ever taste. Believe it or not, making biscuits is incredibly easy, and you can do it right in your kitchen.

Ingredients:

- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup cake flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 cup chilled unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
- 1 1/2 cups chilled buttermilk
- 1/4 cup melted unsalted butter, for brushing

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (218°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking powder, sugar, and kosher salt until well combined.
3. Add the chilled butter to the dry ingredients and use a pastry cutter or your hands to cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal.
4. Make a well in the center and pour in the chilled buttermilk. Mix the dough until it comes together in a sticky mass.
5. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead briefly, about 10 times. Roll out the dough to a thickness of 1 inch.
6. Use a 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter or biscuit cutter to cut out biscuits. Press scraps together and form additional biscuits.
7. Place the biscuits on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush the tops with melted butter.
8. Bake the biscuits for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown on top.
9. Serve immediately with your favorite jam or a drizzle of honey.
