Unlock the Secret to Scoring Red Coins in Super Mario Sunshine's Hotel - Gamers Rejoice!

Super Mario Sunshine, released in 2002, is a classic game that has remained popular even today. This game is filled with exciting levels, hidden secrets, and a captivating storyline that takes Mario on a journey to save the island paradise of Isle Delfino. One of the most challenging levels in the game is the Hotel Delfino level. Specifically, locating the red coins. Here's how to score those elusive red coins.

The Hotel Delfino level is set in a luxurious hotel located on Isle Delfino's beach. Mario has to explore the five-story hotel to collect all the red coins scattered throughout. The red coins represent a significant challenge in this level, and players may be tempted to give up due to their difficulty.

The first red coin can be found just as Mario enters the hotel. He should turn right and then look up to spot an open window. With the help of F.L.U.D.D, Mario should jump onto the window, ground pound it, and grab the red coin.

The next one is straightforward. All Mario needs to do is jump onto the flower beds at the entrance of the hotel to find the second red coin.

The third red coin can be found on the second floor of the hotel. Players should enter the second room on the left, jump onto the bed, and wall jump to the ledge to grab the red coin.

The fourth red coin can be found by climbing up to the stairs to the fourth floor. Players then need to enter the third from the right room, jump onto the bed, and jump onto the computer to grab the red coin.

The fifth and final red coin can be found on the fifth floor of the hotel. Players should enter room 501 and wall jump from the table to grab the coin in mid-air.

Scoring all the red coins in Hotel Delfino  will unlock the shine sprite, giving players a surefooted performance.

In conclusion, Super Mario Sunshine is a game worth playing if you haven't already. The Hotel Delfino level is packed with excitement and mayhem but, with these tips, you should be able to collect all the red coins and unlock the elusive shine sprite. Happy gaming!
