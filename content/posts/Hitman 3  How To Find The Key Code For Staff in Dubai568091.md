By dressing in a disguise and behaving like a staff member, you'll be able to move around undetected and potentially stumble upon the code.

4. Check the Staff Rooms

Throughout the Dubai level, there are several staff rooms and break areas. These locations are where the code is most likely to be found. Check the lockers, desks, and computers to see if any of them have clues that will lead you to the code. This is also a great opportunity to don a staff disguise, making it easier to move around and gather information.

5. Don't Forget Your Instincts

Lastly, always listen to your instincts. If something seems out of place or suspicious, investigate it. You never know what you might find. The key to success in Hitman 3 is to be patient, observant, and resourceful. By following these tips, you can uncover the secret key code for staff in Dubai and master the game like a true hitman.
