Rooting is the process of obtaining administrative privileges on your android device, allowing you to fully customize and optimize your phone’s performance. In this article, we’ll guide you through the process of rooting your LG G2 with an incredible hack that will unlock its full potential. 

Why Should You Root Your LG G2? 

Rooting your LG G2 will give you access to a plethora of benefits that are otherwise not available to regular users. Here are some of the reasons why you should consider rooting your LG G2: 

1. Access to System Files and Custom ROMs 

Rooting your LG G2 will provide you with privileged access to the device's system files, which will allow you to modify the operating system to your choosing. With access to custom ROMs, you can install a new operating system on your device and customize the interface, add new features, and improve overall phone performance.

2. Improved Phone Performance 

Rooting your LG G2 will allow you to optimize its performance by removing unwanted apps that slow your device down. With root access, you can use apps that require admin privileges for optimal performance, such as custom recoveries, kernel adiutors, and CPU managers.

3. Increased Storage Space 

The LG G2 comes with limited storage space, which can be expanded by rooting the device. With root access, you can remove pre-installed apps that you don't need, clear cache files, and move apps to your external SD card, increasing your available storage space. 

4. Customization 

Rooting gives you complete control over your LG G2, allowing you to customize every aspect of your device, from the fonts and icons to the boot animation and themes. You can use apps like Xposed Framework, Gravity Box, and Substratum Theme Engine to modify your phone's appearance and functionality to your liking. 

How to Root Your LG G2 With This Unbelievable Hack 

Before you begin, note that rooting your device will void your warranty, and there is always a risk of bricking your device. However, if you follow the instructions carefully, you shouldn't encounter any problems.

Got yourself a brand new LG G2 and are looking to root it? Here is a very simple guide on how to root the new LG G2 in less than 5 minutes.  The LG G2 comes with a locked down bootloader, which makes rooting and flashing a custom ROM on the device comparatively trickier. Thanks to an exploit though, gaining root access on the G2 incredibly easy.
The below rooting process will work for the T-Mobile, AT&T and the Verizon variants of LG G2, but might also work with the unlocked variant being sold in other regions of the world. The process below won’t brick your phone, so there is no harm in giving it a try, even if you don’t own one of the carrier editions of the G2 listed above.
Step 1: Download and install the proper USB drivers (Verizon LG G2 drivers) on your Windows based PC. Then, head over to this link to download the rooting package bundled inside a ZIP file.
Step 2: Extract the contents of the ZIP file inside a new folder on your desktop. Enable USB Debuting on your G2 and connect it to your PC. You can enable USB Debugging from Developer Settings, which is hidden by default on Android 4.2+ devices. To enable USB Debugging, head over to Settings -> About Phone and tap the Build Number seven times. You should now see a new ‘Developer Settings’ sub-menu inside Settings, which contains the option to enable USB Debugging.

Step 3: Connect your G2 to your PC and wait for all the drivers to be detected. Now, double click on the “root.bat” file present inside the folder that you extracted on your desktop on the previous step.
Step 4: After your device has been detected, the window will prompt you to disconnect your device, disable USB Debugging, then again re-enable it and plug the phone back in.
Step 5: Once the device has been re-connected, the script will detect your device and automatically start the rooting procedure. During the process, you will be prompted whether you want to install the Superuser package or not. Make sure to install it, otherwise you won’t be able to give root access to your installed apps.
Step 7: There will also be a prompt asking whether you want to “trip rootchecker” or not. This a security fail-safe mechanism from LG, which detects whether your device has been rooted or not, and automatically voids its warranty. If you don’t trip rootchecker, your root access will be limited to ADB shell only.
Once you have gain root access on your LG G2, make sure not to accept any future OTA updates from your carrier or LG as it may patch the exploit used to gain root access.
If you are stuck at a specific step or are facing any problem, feel free to drop in a comment and we will be more than glad to help!
Update: As mentioned in the comments, if you own the Verizon’s variant of the G2, you will need to select the ‘Ethernet’ option in the USB connection type.
