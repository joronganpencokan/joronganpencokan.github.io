# Discover the Game-Changing Hack to Stream Your Favorite Music on Spotify Without Draining Your Data Plan!

Do you stream music on Spotify but end up with your data plan drained? Do you find yourself constantly toggling between Wi-Fi and mobile data to avoid usage charges? If so, we have got the perfect hack for you!

In this article, we’ll show you a game-changing hack that will enable you to stream your favorite music on Spotify without worrying about your data plan.

# The Hack

The hack we are about to show you involves making use of the ‘Offline Mode’ feature on the Spotify app. This feature allows you to download music ahead of time, allowing you to enjoy your favorite songs even when you’re not connected to the internet.

Firstly, open up the Spotify app, and locate the playlist or album you would like to download. Once you’ve found it, select the ‘Download’ button found on the right-hand side of the screen. The song or album will start downloading, and once done, the ‘Download’ button will be replaced with a green arrow icon.

To avoid Wi-Fi being used during the download, we recommend that you switch your phone's settings to mobile data only while completing the download process. This will ensure that your phone uses mobile data to download the music.

With the music downloaded, you can now switch off your mobile data and launch Spotify. Click on the three-dot option on the right beside the song, and select ‘play offline.’ You will notice that Spotify’s logo changes to a white symbol indicating that you're playing music in offline mode.

# Benefits

The benefits of this hack are limitless. For starters, you can save on your data plan by not streaming music continuously. By downloading songs ahead of time, you can listen to your favorite songs even when you’re offline, such as commuting, taking a walk, or while working out.

Additionally, subscribing to the premium version of Spotify allows you to download an entire album, an artist's discography, and custom playlists. This feature ensures that you can have access to your favorite music at any time without worrying about signal strength or device capacity.

Conclusion

Streaming music on Spotify is a fantastic experience. However, most people end up draining their data plan during this process. By using the offline mode feature, you can enjoy your favorite songs and stay connected with your friends and family without spending extra money on data expenses.

So next time you’re out and about, commuting, or listening to music, make sure to use this hack on Spotify.

Remember, downloading music saves data!

## Steps to Save Data While Streaming Music on Spotify


So, if you are looking for ways to save data while streaming music on Spotify, you are reading the right guide. In this article, we will share some of the best methods to save data while streaming music on Spotify. Let’s check out.

 
### 1. Enable the Data Saver


Spotify mobile app for Android and iOS has a Data Saver feature that sets the music quality to 24 kbit/s. This disables the artist canvases and appears in the Now Playing screen.
The Data Saver is a part of both free and premium versions of Spotify. Here’s how to enable Data Saver in Spotify.
1. First of all, open the Spotify app on your Android/iOS device.
2. Now tap on the gear icon located on the top-right corner of the screen.

3. On the Settings, find and tap on the Data Saver option.

4. Now enable the switch behind Data Saver to enable the feature.

That’s it! You are done. This is how you can enable data saver mode in Spotify.

 
### 2. Change the Audio Quality


Spotify provides you more control over the audio quality than any other music streaming app. Although the Very High Quality is available only to the Spotify Premium users, Spotify free users can still choose between Low, Normal and High.
So, if you are running short of mobile data, you can use the Lowe quality settings to save some data.

To change the Settings, Open Spotify > Settings > Audio Quality. Under the Audio Quality, you need to choose the audio quality for streaming over WiFi and Cellular. If you want to save data, it’s best to choose the Low or Normal option.

 
### 3. Download For Offline Playback



Well, the Download Option is available only to Spotify Premium subscribers. The Spotify Premium app allows you to download playlists and albums for offline playback.
That means, if you listen to the same song every day, you can download it to listen later without connecting to the internet.
So, these are some of the best methods to save data while streaming music on Spotify. I hope this article helped you! Please share it with your friends also. If you have any doubts related to this, let us know in the comment box below.
