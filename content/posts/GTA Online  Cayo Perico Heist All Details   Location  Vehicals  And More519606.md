Introduction

Grand Theft Auto (GTA) Online has become a cultural phenomenon since its initial release in 2013. It has emerged as one of the most engaging and entertaining online gameplays available today. Over the years, Rockstar Games has continuously packed interesting updates, events, and additions to keep the fans interested.

In December 2020, Rockstar Games launched the biggest heist yet in the game with the release of Cayo Perico. The update offered players the opportunity to experience a new heist alongside an entirely new island to explore. This guide aims to provide readers with insight on the new gameplay, tips on how to achieve it, and suggestions on where to find the best vehicles and more.

The Cayo Perico Heist

Cayo Perico Heist is a unique addition to the GTA V universe, offering an entirely new gameplay experience for players. The complex heist allows players to infiltrate the island of Cayo Perico, which is heavily guarded with new weapons, vehicles, and security.

To start the heist, players need to visit the newly introduced character named Miguel Madrazo at his keen outpost. After accepting the heist job, players will have to shoulder the responsibility of gathering intel about the Island's layout, security, weapons, and location of valuable artifacts.

Players can choose to carry out the heist solo or form a group of four players to carry out the job. Failing to carry out the Cayo Perico heist efficiently may result in punishment from the game's authorities.

Where to find the Best Vehicles and Equipment

Vehicles play a significant role in the Cayo Perico heist, and acquiring the appropriate equipment is key to successful heist gameplay. The players must first get their hands on the following vehicles:

The Submarine Car: The Kraken Avisa Submarine ($2.2 million) is the most significant piece of equipment players will need while playing the heist. The submarine takes players to the Island, bypassing the Island's expensive security measures.

The Armor Car: The Armored Karin Kuruma ($698,250) is an essential part of the equipment players will need while carrying out the heist. The car has high-level armor and bullet-resistant windows, making it easier for players to escape during the heist's later stages.

The Attack Helicopter: The Buzzard Attack Chopper ($1,750,000) is a lethal helicopter that the players acquire to knock down the guards, destroy obstacles, and carry out reconnaissance.

Conclusion

The Cayo Perico Heist is the most ambitious heist yet in the GTA Online universe. It offers players an exciting new game experience with an entirely new Island to explore alongside new weapons, vehicles, and characters to interact. It is also essential to keep in mind that the heist requires careful planning, efficient execution, and most importantly, teamwork to be successful. With this guide, players can prepare to embark on a thrilling heist experience while making sure they have the best equipment on their side to emerge victorious.
