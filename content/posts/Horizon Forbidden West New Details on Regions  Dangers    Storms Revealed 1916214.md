# Explore the Wildly Treacherous Terrain of Horizon Forbidden West - A Stormy Adventure Awaits! Learn All the Shocking Details Here!

Are you ready to embark on a thrilling adventure and uncover the secrets of a lost civilization? The world of Horizon Forbidden West, the much-anticipated sequel to the hit game Horizon Zero Dawn, promises to deliver just that and more as you traverse through the dangerous landscapes filled with hazardous conditions, deadly creatures, and eerie ruins.

Set in a post-apocalyptic world, Horizon Forbidden West takes you to the ruins of San Francisco, where you will encounter a variety of environments ranging from lush forests to vast deserts, all fraught with hazards and obstacles to overcome. Traversing such terrain is no easy feat, and you’ll need to be fully equipped with tools, tactics, and strategies to survive.

First off, you’ll encounter a range of formidable foes, each with their strengths and weaknesses. From towering mechanical beasts to swarms of hostile fauna, each enemy will require a different approach to defeat. You’ll need to make smart use of your weapons, traps, and abilities to take down foes, unlocking more gear and skills as you progress through the game.

But it’s not just the creatures that pose a threat; environmental conditions like thunderstorms, lightning strikes, and flash floods can affect your health and environment. You’ll need to be mindful of the weather patterns and adapt accordingly, ensuring that you are adequately protected and prepared for whatever comes your way.

Thankfully, you have the trusty Aloy, the game’s protagonist, on your side, and she comes prepared with an arsenal of weapons and gadgets that can aid you in your adventures. You can use her Focus, a device that scans the surroundings for details, which can help you in your exploration.

One new gadget, the Pullcaster, allows you to grab onto objects and pull them towards you, creating new paths and opportunities to traverse the environment. Other tools like the Shieldwing can help you glide through the air or provide protection against enemy attacks.

The game’s storyline is driven by the mystery surrounding a deadly red blight that is infecting the land, and it’s up to you to figure out the source of this plague and stop it from spreading. Along the way, you’ll unravel clues about the nature of the ancient civilization that once existed here, and the secrets its ruins hold.

With its expansive world, stunning graphics, engaging gameplay, and narrative depth, Horizon Forbidden West promises to be an unforgettable adventure for fans of the first game and new players alike. Are you ready to take on the challenge and explore the dangerous, treacherous terrain that awaits? Get ready to enter the forbidden west!

The September issue of Official PlayStation Magazine UK revealed some new details on the new PS5 exclusive title of Horizon Forbidden West.
 
As we are aware, Horizon Forbidden West was recently revealed during the PlayStation 5 games presentation event, today the first significant details about the game that fans have been waiting for a long time have finally emerged.
 
Some fans had already recognized the game region, but today we finally have new confirmations: Aloy’s new adventure will be set between Utah and the Pacific Ocean with San Francisco and Yosemite Valley confirmed as places to explore.
 
As it was also known from the video, the famous Golden Gate Bridge fell into the ocean, but some of the most iconic structures have been inserted so as to be noticed by the players.
 
The director Mathijs De Jonge shared some details about the improvements implemented in this second chapter. Here are his words: “With the additional power of the PS5 we can make the world even more detailed, more vibrant, more immersive.”
 
In addition, it was also revealed that San Francisco was devastated by a major earthquake, which started at the exact moment when Earth as we know definitively entered chaos. Our planet is now teeming with new wildlife, both living and mechanical.
 
From the video, we were able to admire some of these new creatures, and in line with the first chapter also in this new adventure, you can find and dismantle the weak points of the various machines.
 
Several mechanical beasts have already been revealed: the Shellsnapper, or that sort of giant tortoise, is found in coastal and marshy regions, the Snapjaws are crocodiles and are found in the now submerged Ferry Building, and the Sunwings that look like pterodactyls can be seen in the tropical area of ​​California.
 
Aloy will also face nature’s fury in the form of storms. These cause a lot of damage and change to the game world, but their actual weight within the experience has not yet been revealed. These storms also produce red electrical energy sparks, which cause what is called “red blight.” This disease infects the earth and weakens wildlife, destroys crops and most lives die.
 
This is the information we have now on the title, but we hope that Guerrilla Games will release new information on Horizon Forbidden West soon.
 
Recall that Horizon Forbidden West will release on PS5 in 2021.
