# Unlock the Best Holiday Gift Yet: Buy Oneplus One without Invites!

Could it be possible to buy the best holiday gift without any hassle? Yes, it’s true! Oneplus One, the smartphone that has been creating a lot of buzz in the market, is now available to buy without any invites. 

Oneplus One has been a favorite choice among smartphone enthusiasts due to its high-quality features and affordable price tag. However, the biggest drawback of this phone was that it was only available through an invite system, which caused frustration for many potential buyers. 

But now, Oneplus has opened up sales for its Oneplus One model, starting December 5th, without requiring any invitation from interested buyers. This means that anyone can purchase the phone without any restrictions, just in time for the holiday season.

Oneplus One boasts cutting edge technology, like its 5.5-inch Full HD display, 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor, and 13-megapixel camera. Aside from its hardware, the phone features a customizable ROM, which provides users with more control over their device’s functionality. Its affordable price tag makes the Oneplus One even more desirable, competing with top-tier phone brands while keeping the cost considerably lower.

With the holiday season fast approaching, it’s high time to find the best gift for your loved ones. The Oneplus One could be the perfect present for that special someone seeking an efficient and high-quality smartphone. And now, with sales open for all, it’s far easier to get your hands on the coveted Oneplus One model, without requiring any invitation or third-party dealer.

Along with the upgraded models of Oneplus One, the company has also released its new Oneplus X series, which boasts the same top-quality features in a smaller form. The Oneplus X smartphone comes with a 5.0-inch Full HD screen, Snapdragon 801 processor, and 3GB RAM. Its Gorilla Glass body adds durability, making it scratch proof and shatter resistant.

In conclusion, the holiday season calls for the perfect gift, and the Oneplus One stands out as a perfect option. With its high-end features, affordability, and now the opportunity to purchase without an invitation, there’s no better time to gift it to yourself or your loved ones. So, hurry, and grab your Oneplus One before it goes out of stock!

Not much long time since the Black Friday after OnePlus had given its potential buyers the option to buy OnePlus One without invites, it has repeated the offer again. This time it is for the upcoming holidays- undoubtedly the Christmas, as stated by the company that the offer will be valid till December 25th. Along with this, it has also been promised that the delivery of the phone will be done by Christmas (if any unforeseeable events does not occur, which disturb the delivery of OnePlus One). 
 
The pricing of the OnePlus One is as usual though, which is $299 for the Silk White 16 GB version, and $349 for the Sandstone Black 64 GB version. This is indeed a great device to offer much higher specs in the price range, with also the most stable ROM of Android- CyanogenMod. Lately, the OnePlus One was released in India, where it was stated that it won’t get any updates from Cyanogen (which was altered twice, and the final conclusion was the Indian versions of the phone won’t get the updates bu the global versions will).
 
OnePlus has made its One smartphone for the users to buy without invites only a couple of times before, which was in the last Black Friday and by the Oppo Mart online store in June (which was much expensive though). Similar to the past deals, this time also the offer to buy OnePlus One without invites will be valid only till the stocks last, so you will have to hurry up if you want to possess this smartphone in case you missed the past deal, or have not got any invites. So, go to the purchase site, buy it as you do the normal online shopping, and enjoy with your solidly built and amazingly priced OnePlus One this Christmas and New Year.
