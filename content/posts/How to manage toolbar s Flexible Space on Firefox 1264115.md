What is the Toolbar's Flexible Space?

The Toolbar's Flexible Space is a blank area on your Firefox toolbar that can be resized, rearranged, and customized to suit your browsing needs. It's a powerful tool that can help you organize your tabs, bookmarks, and other important items for quick access. You can access the Flexible Space by right-clicking on the toolbar and selecting "Customize Toolbar."

Rearranging Toolbar Items

One of the most useful features of the Flexible Space is the ability to rearrange your toolbar items. You can drag and drop buttons, bookmarks, and other items to different locations on your toolbar.

First, consider dedicating the left side of your toolbar to commonly used tabs and bookmarks. This will make it easy to access your most-used items without cluttering your toolbar.

Another tip is to use the Flexible Space to add separators between your toolbar items. This can help you visually organize your items and make it easier to find what you need quickly. To add a separator, simply drag and drop a vertical line into the Flexible Space between your toolbar items.
