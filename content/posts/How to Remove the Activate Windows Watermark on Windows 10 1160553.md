# Say Goodbye to the Pesky Activate Windows Watermark in Just 3 Simple Steps on Windows 10 & 11!

Are you tired of seeing the Activate Windows watermark on your PC every time you turn it on? Do you want to get rid of it for good but don't know how? If so, you're in luck because we're going to show you how to do it in just three simple steps!

## Step 1: Check Your Windows Activation Status

The first step in getting rid of the Activate Windows watermark is to check your activation status. To do this, go to Settings > Update & Security > Activation. Here, you will see whether or not your Windows is activated.

If your Windows is not activated, you will need to purchase a product key to activate it. You can do this by going to the Microsoft Store or visiting the Microsoft website and purchasing a key. Once you have the key, you can activate Windows by going to Settings > Update & Security > Activation and entering the key.

If your Windows is already activated, move on to step two.

## Step 2: Disable Windows Watermark

Now that your Windows is activated, you can proceed to disable the Activate Windows watermark. To do this, you'll need to access the Registry Editor. You can do this by typing "regedit" in the search bar or by pressing the Windows key + R and typing "regedit" in the Run dialog box.

Once you have the Registry Editor open, navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER > Control Panel > Desktop. Here, you'll see a key named "PaintDesktopVersion." Double-click on it to open it and change the value data to "0." Click "OK" to save your changes.

Restart your PC, and voila! The Activate Windows watermark should be gone.

## Step 3: Use a Third-Party Tool

If you don't feel comfortable accessing the Registry Editor, there are plenty of third-party tools that can help you disable the watermark. Some popular options include "RemoveWAT," "KMSPico," and "Windows Loader."

Before you download any of these tools, make sure to do your research and only download from a reputable source. Additionally, be aware that using these tools may be against Microsoft's terms of service and could potentially harm your PC.

In conclusion, getting rid of the Activate Windows watermark is a quick and easy process. By following these three simple steps, you can say goodbye to the pesky watermark for good. Remember to always purchase a legitimate product key to activate your Windows and proceed with caution when using third-party tools.
