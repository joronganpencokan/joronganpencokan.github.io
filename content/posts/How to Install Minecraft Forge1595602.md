Minecraft has been one of the most popular games of the decade. This open-world sandbox game allows players to explore and create whatever they want in a virtual world. Minecraft has come a long way since its release, with advancements in graphics, gameplay, and infinite possibilities for the players. Minecraft mods have also played a significant role in the game's popularity, as they allow players to customize their gaming experience in ways previously unimaginable. One such mod that every Minecraft player should know about is Minecraft Forge.

Minecraft is great on its own, but installing community-built Minecraft mods opens up brand new ways to play, and some of the best ones are built on Minecraft Forge. Mods are literally user-created modifications for Minecraft that add new content, make it run better and look better, make your life easier in-game, and more. You need Forge first, so we'll show you how to install Minecraft Forge, and then provide some tips on what to do once you have it.

 
##   What Does Minecraft Forge Do?  
 

In less technical terms, Minecraft Forge is makes it extremely easy to install compatible Minecraft mods. If a mod supports Forge, then you can install that mod by literally dragging and dropping the files if you have Forge installed.

 
##   Forge vs. the Vanilla Version  
 

When you download and install Minecraft Forge, Minecraft: Java Edition provides you with the option to play the vanilla edition or your Forge-modded edition every time you play. Choosing Forge causes Minecraft Forge to automatically load all of your mods, while choosing the vanilla version allows you to play without any mods.

 

Due to the way you can choose to load Forge or vanilla Minecraft, you never have to worry about Forge or an individual mod breaking your game. If something weird happens, you can always just play the vanilla version of Minecraft until a patch arrives for Forge, the offending mod, or Minecraft itself.

 
##   Minecraft Forge Is a Mod Loader  
 

As a player, Minecraft Forge is an automated mod loader. It checks for compatible mods, then loads them up each time you play, as long as you choose Forge from the Minecraft: Java Edition profile menu. You can run as many mods as you want, although running too many can cause performance issues, and some mods don't work well with others.

 
Major Minecraft updates often cause bugs with Forge and individual mods. When that happens, you can choose to run the vanilla version until additional patches arrive, or try removing all your mods and adding them back in one at a time to see which one is causing trouble.
 

Mods can improve or alter the graphics of your game, introduce new game modes and mechanics, improve inventory and crafting systems, and more. There's even a mod to add the same type of virtual reality functionality to Minecraft: Java Edition that Minecraft for Windows 10 has right out of the box.

 
##   How to Use Mods With Forge  
 

The best part is that, since Forge is an automated loader, all you have to do is download the mod you want, place it into your Minecraft folder, and launch Minecraft. As long as you have the Forge profile selected, your mod will load with no additional configuration or work required on your part.
