Title: Relive Your Childhood Nostalgia with Hover, The Epic Windows 95 Game Made Even Better for Modern Times!

Are you a 90s kid who misses playing the iconic Windows 95 game called Hover? Do you want to relive the nostalgia and feel like a kid again? Fortunately, you don't need to dig through your old computer files to find this classic game. Hover has returned, revamped, and better than ever before.

For those who don't know about Hover, it was a computer game bundled with Microsoft Windows 95. The game is a combination of racing, capture the flag, and other game modes. The game's primary objective was to race hovercraft, collecting coins and completing other challenges to unlock additional levels.

Now, Hover has returned as Hover+: The Ultimate Windows 95 Experience, thanks to Levitum, LLC, and their self-funded project. The game has been updated for modern times and is available on Windows 10, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. With modern hardware and software, Hover+ has enhanced graphics, sound, and robust gameplay features.

One of the game's most significant improvements is its multiplayer mode. You can join eight other players to race, fight, and capture the flag in the vast game world. The multiplayer mode brings together players from across the world who are eager to relive their childhood.

Moreover, Hover+ has several new levels that have been added since its initial release, as well as unique characters with different hovercrafts to choose from. The new levels include an airport, harbor, castle, and many others that provide new gameplay experiences for players.

In addition, the game's soundtrack has been rewritten and rerecorded to provide an iconic gaming experience. The original soundtrack by Matt Furniss is still present, but the new soundtrack features several remixes by old-school 90s techno artists such as Kai Rosenkranz, Frank Klepacki, and Rom Di Prisco.

Hover+ takes the nostalgia of the original game and enhances it with modern gameplay elements, making it a perfect game for people of all ages. Even if you've never played the original game, Hover+ has the charm and visual appeal to make for a fantastic gaming experience.

In conclusion, Hover+ is the perfect game to relive your childhood and create new memories with your friends. With its modern enhancements, it's an incredible game that is well worth the purchase price. Get your hovercraft ready and relive the nostalgia of the 90s with Hover+!

Microsoft just resurrected the classic “Hover” game bundled with the Windows 95 installation media. For those old enough, if you remember this was a first person bumper cars and capture the flag combination game, and now the software giant has adapted it for Internet Explorer 11, but of course it works pretty much on any modern web browser.
 
Hover is free to play by logging-in to Hover.ie, then simply choose your car and click play. Microsoft has specially designed the game for touch-enabled devices like tablets and with new graphics. For those who liked the original version, they can go to the site and before doing anything type Bambi on the screen, and the old retro version of game will appear as if you were using Windows 95.
 

 
The company also noted that “Hover is a collaborative project that came to us by way of an independent developer named Dan Church. Dan grew up playing Hover and loved it so much that he asked us if he could update the game. His enthusiasm was contagious and we became excited by the idea of partnering with Dan and our friends at Pixel Labs to bring a reimagined Hover to the modern web.”
 
With the game, Microsoft has also released a comical video in YouTube showcasing “Hover” on a Windows 8 tablet, which looks like a Surface Pro.
