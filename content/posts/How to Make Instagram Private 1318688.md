The first step to a secure Instagram account is a strong password. Use at least eight characters, including numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and symbols.

### Can I Hide My Instagram from Everyone?
 
Yes. For those who prefer to share information on Instagram solely with a limited set of users, there is a Private Account option. You will become less visible, but you will gain privacy because it stops people from watching you. People can see you if you set your profile to private, but they won’t be able to view your posts. Alternatively, you can temporarily disable your account, hide or block someone from seeing your profile, or create a list of your close friends and share stories with them.
 
### How Do I Make My Instagram Private?
 
The simplest way to hide your account is to make it private. Even if someone eventually manages to find your profile, they won’t be able to see your posts until you specifically allow them access. Individuals may choose to make their accounts private for a variety of reasons, such as to avoid being followed by unknown users or spam accounts, to keep their personal life private, or just to avoid receiving creepy DMs or remarks from random people.
 
Read the steps mentioned below to make your Instagram account Private.
 
1. Launch the Instagram application on your Android and iOS devices.
 
2. Then, tap on the Profile tab from the bottom bar.
 
3. Tap on the hamburger icon.
 
4. Tap on Settings.
 
5. Now, tap on Privacy.
 
6. Turn on the toggle for the Private account option.
 
Despite the fact that your account is currently set to private, you may always turn it back to the public whenever you want.

### How to Make Instagram Private from Business?
 
Since Instagram hasn’t made private profiles available for businesses, you’ll need to switch your account type to personal to make it private. Therefore, you must first switch your company Instagram account to the personal account type if you intend to make it private.
 
If you want to make your company account private so that only authorized followers can see it, follow these steps:
 
Note: Content and insights from your promotions as well as insights into the recent and upcoming posts will be lost when you switch to a personal account.
 
1. Open the Instagram app on your phone and navigate to your profile.
 
2. Tap on the hamburger icon from the top-right corner.
 
3. Tap on Settings > Account > Switch account type.
 
4. Then, tap on Switch to personal account.
 
5. From the confirmation popup, tap on Switch to personal account.
 
6. After this, follow the steps mentioned in the above heading to make your account private.
 
### How to Switch Back to Personal Account on Instagram?
 
Would you like to convert your Instagram business account back to a personal account? Not sure how to move ahead?
 
Don’t worry. You can switch back at any time if you’ve changed your personal Instagram profile to a business one. Read the detailed instructions mentioned above for switching from a business account to a personal profile on IG.
 
### How Can Someone Follow Me on Instagram If My Account is Private?
 
When you set your account to private, anyone who wants to see your posts, followers, or following list will need to send you a follow request. Requests to follow you show up under Activity, where you can accept or reject them. Only the followers you’ve allowed will be able to like and comment on your pictures and videos.
 
Note: When you switch your account to private, anyone who was previously following you will continue to do so. That implies that you must take someone off your list of followers if you wish to restrict access to someone.
 
### How to Hide My Instagram Account from Search?
 
Finding someone on Instagram and visiting their account are both very simple. In order to browse through their accounts, all you need to do is type their name into the Instagram search bar. Everybody on Instagram who has an Instagram account can view your posts, stories, and IGTV videos if your account is set to Public.
 
However, these methods can be used to hide your Instagram if you still don’t want to make it that simple for people to find your account.
 
Method 1: Remove Linked Accounts
 
You may want to start by being aware that your Instagram account includes a feature that enables you to link it with other social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. If you often post content from Instagram to Facebook or Twitter, you may not be aware of this, but this connection increases your visibility to your friends on these networks. As a result, whenever a user creates a new account, some Instagram accounts appear in the list as potential friends or people you may know that you should follow. Let’s see how to remove the linked accounts:
 
1. Open the Instagram app on your phone.
 
2. Tap on the Profile tab > hamburger icon > Settings.
 
3. Tap on Accounts Centre.
 
4. Then, select the desired social media account.
 
5. Tap on Remove From Accounts Center.
 
6. Tap on Remove [username] to confirm the process.

Method 2: Remove Phone Number
 
When we set up a new Instagram account, it lists the users who are already using the platform. As we grant Instagram access, this is conducted with the help of your Contacts list. While some people will benefit from it, others, including those who wish to hide their Instagram profiles, won’t. To turn off the feature, you must now delete the phone number from your account.
 
1. Go to IG Profile after opening the app on your phone and tap on Edit profile.
 
2. Tap on Personal information settings.
 
3. Now, remove your phone number and tap on Next.

Method 3: Turn Off Similar Account Suggestions
 
As you may have observed, the feed on the home page frequently displays numerous Instagram profile suggestions. It now depends on the accounts that we follow and those that follow us. By accessing the settings section of your Instagram account, you can adjust this. The use of Instagram’s web browser is the only thing that makes this move possible. Follow these steps.
 
1. Visit the Instagram website on your browser.
 
Note: Make sure you are logged into your account.
 
2. Click on the hamburger icon > Settings from the left pane.
 
3. Click on the Edit profile tab.
 
4. Turn off the checkbox for the Similar account suggestions option from the bottom.
 
### Is There Any Instagram Private Account Viewer?
 
Yes, plenty of them. Instagram allows us a behind-the-scenes look at other people’s lives. Even if you choose not to follow those private accounts, you may not always have access to the images and videos that some users post because you can make an account private.
 
The fact that this private Instagram viewer is useful for keeping tabs on what the target profile is doing on Instagram, stands out as one of its main features. You can study photos and other activities on private Instagram accounts using software that lets you see private Instagram accounts. It is intended to help people whose following has been restricted or who have been blocked by the account owner.
