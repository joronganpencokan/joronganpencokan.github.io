The Homegroup feature had been around since Windows 7. It allows you to easily share files, folders and media with another Windows PC without having to go through complicated setup. In Windows 8, Homegroups are easy to create, even more so than they were in Windows 7. In this article, we will show you how to create homegroup in Windows 8.
 
## How to create a Homegroup in Windows 8
 
From the Start screen, search for “Homegroup,” then click on “Settings” and “Homegroup.”
 

 
Click “Create” to begin the process.
 
From here, you can pick and choose the files, folders, and attached devices that you want to share. Choose wisely, make sure you are not granting additional permission than it is necessary.
 
If you have media devices hooked up over your network, they can also access shared content. This allows others to watch movies and play games over a Homegroup.
 
The last thing you want to do is make note of the Homegroup password. You’ll want to share this with other PCs in your network so they can join the Homegroup.
 
## Changing a Homegroup’s settings
 
In Windows 7 or 8, you can access your Homegroup settings at any time to change how you share folders by right-clicking on the Homegroup in the My Computer window.
 
Click “Change Homegroup” settings.
 
You can change what you share, what media is shared or access the advanced sharing settings.
 
If you’re on the Windows 8 computer that created the Homegroup, you can change the password, too.
 
The advanced settings allow individual PCs to change how they connect to the Homegroup.
 
You have three types of profiles: Private, Guest or Public and All Networks. For security purposes, you should utilize each type of profile for different connections. This allows you to pick and choose what you share when connected to a Homegroup over a variety of network connections.
 
## Joining a Homegroup in Windows 8
 
If you leave your Homegroup, you can rejoin at any time by heading back to the Homegroup settings.
 
You’ll be alerted that a Homegroup exists. All you need to do is enter your password and click “Join.”
 
## Joining a Homegroup in Windows 7
 
Any Windows 7 version can join a Homegroup. In order to do so, click on “My Computer” and then “Homegroup.”
 
As long as your PC detects the Homegroup, you’ll be prompted to join it. Click “Join now.”
 
You’ll need to choose what libraries and devices you’ll share with the Homegroup and enter the password.
 
It’ll take a few moments to connect. Once you’re connected, you’ll immediately be able to access what’s being shared by other computers on the Homegroup.
 
## Troubleshooting issues connecting to a Homegroup
 
There’s been reports of issues connecting to a Homegroup created on Windows 8 when doing so from a Windows 7 PC.
 
One of the most common issues is that the original Homegroup password doesn’t work when trying to join the Homegroup.
 
You can counter this by manually changing the password for the Homegroup on the Windows 8 PC.
 
Another common issue is that a Windows 7 PC may not automatically detect the Homegroup.
 
If you don’t see the Homegroup on your Windows 7 PC, cycle your home network completely and restart your PC. This will refresh your Homegroups for the entire network and they will show up properly in Windows 7.
 
## Conclusion
 
Homegroups can be a powerful way to connect Windows computers on a network. While most users never create a Homegroup, when set up and utilized frequently, Homegroups can be a quick and easy way to share files, folders and more.
