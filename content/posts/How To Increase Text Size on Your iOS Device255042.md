Reading on your IOS device is one of the most comfortable and convenient things in the world. It is something that you don't have to carry around with you as a separate gadget.

However, often, when we try to read something on our IOS device, be it a novel, a work email, a news article or a blog post, we find ourselves struggling with 'unreadability'. The small font size, the uneven line spacing, and the monotonous screen display can all combine to make reading on your IOS device an unpleasant experience. But, what if we told you that there is a simple text size hack that can take your IOS reading experience to the next level?

For some of you, seeing the text displayed on your iOS device may be a tad bit difficult, especially after Apple chose to change the display font in iOS 8. You may just want to make the text size a bit bigger, especially if your eyesight isn’t what it used to be.
 
Fortunately, Apple’s OS is always very user-friendly, and indeed that comes to use in such a situation. If you find your device’s default text size to be less than ideal, don’t worry. We’ll show you how to easily adjust the text size on your iOS device below:
 
1. Open up the Settings app on your iOS device from the Home Screen.
 
2. Scroll down and click on “Display & Brightness -> Text Size.”
 

 
From here, you can drag the text slider to the left to make the text size smaller and to the right to increase the size.
 
Once you’ve set the text size to your desire, you’ll automatically notice that the text size all over the iOS interface will be updated accordingly. Similarly, all Apple apps and third-party apps automatically update their text settings to adapt to the changes you made.
 
If you’re still looking for bigger text on your device, you can choose to further increase the size by navigating to “Settings -> General -> Accessibility -> Larger Text.”
 
From here, toggle on the option for “Larger Accessibility Sizes.” Using the slider, you’ll be able to further increase the text size to your liking.
