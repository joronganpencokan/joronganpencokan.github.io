# Unleash Your Inner Angler in Hades with these Expert Fishing Tips!

Fishing is a popular pastime that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. Whether you are an experienced angler or a beginner, there is always something new to learn and discover when it comes to fishing. And what better place to do this than in Hades, the mythical underworld of the Greek mythos?

With its deep, murky waters and mysterious creatures, the rivers and lakes in the underworld of Hades can prove to be quite challenging for even the most skilled anglers. But fear not, as we have compiled a list of expert fishing tips that will help you unleash your inner angler in Hades and take your fishing game to the next level.

## Tip #1: Know your prey

Before casting your line, it’s important to know the type of fish you are looking for. In Hades, the rivers and lakes are home to various species of fish such as the Hydra, the Cerberus, the Charon, and the Lernean Eel. Each of these fish have their own unique characteristics and behaviours, so it’s important to study them before setting out on your fishing trip.

## Tip #2: Use the right bait

Once you have identified your target fish, the next step is to use the right bait to lure them in. In Hades, the fish are known to be attracted to different types of bait such as the blood of the Titans, the entrails of the souls of the departed, and the tears of the Furies. Experimentation is key when it comes to bait selection, so be sure to try out different combinations to see what works best.

## Tip #3: Master your casting technique

Casting is an important aspect of fishing, as it determines the distance and accuracy of your cast. In the murky waters of Hades, it’s important to perfect your technique as visibility is low and fish are often lurking in the shadows. Practice your casting technique before venturing into the underworld to ensure that you can cast your line accurately and effectively.

## Tip #4: Use the right equipment

Fishing in Hades can be challenging, so it’s important to use the right equipment for the job. Heavy-duty rods and reels are recommended, as the fish in the underworld are known to be strong and aggressive. You may also want to consider using a fish finder or depth finder to help locate the best fishing spots.

## Tip #5: Be patient

Fishing is a game of patience, and this is especially true in Hades where the fish can be elusive and hard to catch. Wait for the right moment to strike, and don’t get discouraged if you don’t catch anything right away. With persistence and perseverance, you’re bound to reel in a big catch eventually.

In conclusion, fishing in Hades can be a challenging yet rewarding experience for anglers of all skill levels. By following these expert fishing tips, you can unleash your inner angler and explore the mysterious and murky waters of the underworld with confidence and skill. Happy fishing!

Fishing was not available in Hades until the Long Winter update patch. It is now added as a minigame in the dangerous underworld. Catching fish during this mini-game can also yield some great rewards. Players can now find pools scattered throughout the game and can dig in their fishing rod to start fishing in Hades. That brings us to the fishing rod, and as we all know we cannot fish without a rod. Hence, players will first have to get the fishing rod and then start fishing. If you don’t know where to find the fishing rod or how to fish in Hades, this guide will answer all your queries. In this Hades how to fish guide, we will discuss everything about fishing in the game right from getting the rod to fishing to rewards.
 
## Fishing in Hades
 
### How to Get Fishing Rod
 
The fishing rod is the primary requirement for fishing. Without it, you cannot fish in Hades. The fishing rod can be purchased from the house of the contractor for a cost of one diamond. It is easy to collect one diamond as you can simply get it by progressing in the game and killing the bosses.
 
### How to Find Fishing Pools
 
Fishing pools are spawned randomly in rooms that have water or magma. They are scattered throughout the underworld biomes. You can find them in all the four biomes of the game and in chaos rooms too.
 
The game will notify you when a fishing spot is nearby. When you enter a non-combat room that has a fishing pool, you will be notified with a bing sound. On the other hand, when you enter a combat room the has a fishing pool, you will again be notified with a bing sound but this time only after you have completed the room task and collected the room reward.
 
If you think that you might have missed the notification sound, you yourself can roam in the room and look for glowing points.
 
### How to Fish
 
Once you get the sound and you spot a fishing pool, you can remove your fishing rod out and throw it into the pool. Now, wait until the bobber is fully under the water. Remember, it has to be fully submerged and not just going down and up. Once the bobber is submerged you can begin to reel in, if your timing is right you will get the fish or else you will get disappointment.
 
Depending on the timing of reel in, you can get different fishes. Here’s the list of time and the fishes you get if you catch within that time.
 
- 0.34 seconds or less: Guaranteed rare fish, 5 % chance of legendary fish
 - 0.34 seconds to 1 second: Guaranteed uncommon fish, 5 % chance of rare fish
 - 1 second or longer: No fish

 
### How to Get Rewards From the Fish
 
Once you have completed your run, you can head to the Head Chef in the House of Hades and hand him over the fish that you have collected. He stands behind the counter in the kitchen. Depending on the fish that you hand him, he will grant you with rewards.
