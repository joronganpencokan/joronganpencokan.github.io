Are you tired of being a measly amateur Assassin in Hitman 3? Are you ready to take your skills to the next level? Look no further because we have just the challenge for you! 

The Domestic Disturbance Challenge is one of Hitman 3’s toughest challenges yet. It's all about taking down your targets as stealthily as possible in the privacy of their own homes, without any witnesses. 

But mastering this challenge isn't easy. It requires careful planning, precise execution, and a sharp mind. But fear not! We’ve put together some tips and tricks that will help you unleash your inner assassin and conquer the Domestic Disturbance Challenge with ease.

## Plan your approach

Before you dive into any Hitman 3 challenge, make sure you take some time to plan your approach. The Domestic Disturbance Challenge has two targets, both of whom are in different houses. So, you must take advantage of the level map and study their routines thoroughly.

Start by identifying the easiest and most efficient route to get to each target, and then map out their daily routines. Pay attention to their movements, the people, and objects around them. Learn when and where there may be opportunities for you to strike. 

## Get the right gear

The Domestic Disturbance Challenge requires deadly precision, and the right gear can make all the difference. Ensure you have the right weapons at your disposal, such as a sniper rifle, fiber wire, or lethal poison. These will make your kills more efficient and less messy.

In addition, make sure you have the right equipment to aid you in your mission. Items such as lockpicks, silenced pistols, and smoke bombs can help you navigate through the environment quickly and discreetly.

## Master disguises

Disguises are useful in any Hitman 3 challenge, and the Domestic Disturbance Challenge is no exception. Mastering disguises is all about blending in and gathering the right information while you're undercover.

When planning your approach, identify disguises that can get you access to restricted areas. But make sure you don't raise any suspicion in doing so. Act the part, and make sure you know how to move and interact with the environment as the character you're impersonating.

## Be patient and calm

As you get closer to your targets, always remember to remain calm and patient. The Domestic Disturbance Challenge requires you to take your time and wait for the right moments to strike.

Avoid rushing into situations and getting into noisy confrontations with your targets. Wait for a clear shot or the right opportunity to make your move. 

## Conclusion

The Domestic Disturbance Challenge may seem daunting at first, but with the right approach, gear, and patience, it's not impossible to conquer. Follow the tips and tricks mentioned above to unleash your inner assassin and master the challenge today! Good luck!
