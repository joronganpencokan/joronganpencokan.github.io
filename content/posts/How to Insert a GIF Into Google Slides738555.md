Boost Your Presentations to the Next Level with This One Insanely Simple Trick: How to Add Gif to Google Slides!

Are your presentations lacking a bit of “wow” factor? Do you want to take your slides to the next level and impress your audience with more than just boring text and static images? Look no further! With this one insanely simple trick, you can take your presentations from ordinary to extraordinary – all by adding Gifs to Google Slides.

We all love Gifs – they’re fun, engaging, and often help convey our emotions better than words. In a presentation, Gifs can serve the same purpose. They can effectively illustrate points, convey emotions, and even inject some humor into your slides. Here’s how you can add Gifs to your Google Slides:

Step 1: Find the Right Gif

The first step in adding a Gif to your Google Slide is finding the right one. There are plenty of websites where you can find Gifs, such as Giphy, Tenor, or Imgur. You can search for the perfect Gif based on the topic of your presentation, the message you want to convey, or the emotions you want to evoke.

Step 2: Copy the Link

Once you’ve found the perfect Gif, simply copy the link provided by the website. You can do this by either right-clicking on the Gif and selecting “Copy Image URL” or by clicking on the “Copy Link” button provided by the website.

Step 3: Insert the Gif

Now it’s time to insert the Gif into your Google Slide. To do this, simply go to the slide where you want to insert the Gif and click on the “Insert” menu, then select “Image.” Next, click on the “By URL” tab and paste the link you copied earlier into the box. Press “Apply” and voila! You’ve just added a Gif to your slide.

Step 4: Adjust the Size and Placement

To make sure your Gif looks good on the slide, you may need to adjust its size and placement. You can do this by clicking on the Gif and then dragging the handles to resize it. You can also move it around the slide by clicking and dragging it to the desired location.

With these simple steps, you can easily add Gifs to your Google Slides and take your presentations to the next level. Whether you want to convey a message, illustrate a point, or simply inject some humor into your slides, Gifs can be the perfect addition. So go ahead, give it a try – your audience will thank you for it!

You can add GIFs to Google Slides presentations in a few different ways. On Windows and Mac, you can insert GIFs stored on a computer, in Google Drive, or from a URL from a service like Giphy. You can even add a GIF you created. Here's how to add GIFs to Google Slides.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- From a URL: Select Insert > Image > By URL, paste the URL, and click Insert.From a computer: Click Insert > Image > Upload from computer, choose a file, and select Open.From Google Drive or Google Photos: Go to Insert > Image > Drive or Photos, choose a GIF, and select Insert.

 
##   How to Add GIFs to Google Slides With a URL  
 

If you have a link to the GIF, you can add it to Slides using the URL. You can copy the URL from the source, such as GIPHY or a GIF generator. Google is another good source for finding GIFs and other images. Enter a keyword or phrase into the search engine, click Images, then click Tools > Type > GIF.

 

To get the URL from Google search, click the GIF to select it, then right-click (CTRL-click on Mac) and select Save image address.

 

The process is the same for most GIF websites: click the GIF, then share (or select the share icon) and copy the URL. (If the URL doesn’t work, try right-clicking and saving the image address.)

 

Another source is Tumblr. Go to tumblr.com/tagged/gif, input your search term, click a GIF, then the three-dot menu icon, then click Permalink. Beware, this site contains NSFW (not save for work) images.

 

Once you have the URL, go back to your Google Slides presentation and click the slide in which you want to add a GIF.

 
- Click Insert.

 - If you copy and paste the image and not the URL, it will likely stop playing and look like a still image.
