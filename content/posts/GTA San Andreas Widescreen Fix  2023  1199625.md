Grand Theft Auto San Andreas first released in 2004 but till date, many are still playing and enjoying the game. Now that the Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition is announced which includes GTA SA, players can experience the game in widescreen on current generation platforms without any issue. But until then, here’s what you can do as a GTA San Andreas Widescreen fix.
 
## GTA San Andreas (SA) Widescreen Fix
 

 
To get widescreen resolution in GTA SA, you will have to download an external mod. But before using them, make sure you have a backup of your original files so that just in case any issue crops up, your saves and progress are safe.
 
- Search GTA San Andreas Widescreen mod in Google and you will come across a github page (thirteenag) where you can download the files. You can check out the pictures to see how the graphics will look in widescreen.
 - Once the zip files are downloaded, extract the archive.
 - From the extracted files, copy the scripts folder and .dll file.
 - Paste these files into your GTA SA game directory. (Copy and Replace)
 - Launch the game and see if the aspect ratio is fixed.

 
Keep in mind that these files could crash your game, so be prepared for it by having a backup.
 
### What does the Widescreen mod do?
 
Originally the game will run with black borders on the sides of the game because there is no widescreen support. Even if the game runs on fullscreen, the textures may appear pixelated. Now with the standard displays being in widescreen aspect ratio, many players are looking to play their favorite iconic games by filling up the screen completely. This is where the mod/plugin will come into the picture. It will adjust the game as per the resolution of your monitor.
 
After implementing the mod, you can modify your in-game display settings to get the look and feel as you want in the game. This fix can be applied to get monitor resolution support like WXGA 1366 x 768, full HD 1920×1080 and even other popular resolutions.
 
### GTA SA Widescreen Fix Not Working?
 
Some players are reporting that this mod does not work if you run the game via the Steam client. As per the comments in the video below, it seems that you have to downgrade your game first to make it work.
