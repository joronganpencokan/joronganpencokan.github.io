However, this location also has a very common species of animal that will offer you a steady supply of perfect pelts: Whitetail deer. To find the exact spot, travel to the east of Braithwaithe Mansion, you will find a small pond. Stand south-east of the pond and keep an eye on the open fields facing east. At its center, you will find a wide-open space where Whitetail deer congregate. Using a bow and arrow, you can hunt these deer and enjoy a steady supply of perfect pelts.

Moreover, after you have collected several perfect pelts, you can upgrade your satchel.

You can find Pearson's store in Saint Denis, in the eastern part of the Map. When you visit the Trapper, select the satchel option, which will show you the perfect pelt requirement for the upgrade. By bringing the perfect pelts to Pearson, he will craft a larger satchel that can carry more items.
