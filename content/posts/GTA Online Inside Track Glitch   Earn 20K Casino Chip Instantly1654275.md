If so, then we have the perfect solution for you. With this Inside Track Glitch, you can grab 20K casino chips in just a blink. Yes, you heard it right. Keep reading to discover how you can make your way to easy and quick riches in GTA Online.

The Inside Track Glitch Technique

If you're familiar with GTA Online, then you probably know about the Inside Track betting area in Diamond Casino. Here, you can place a bet on horse racing, hoping that your pick will win. With every win, you will earn a handful of chips that you can use to play the casino games. But the payout is not always reliable, and sometimes you may end up with nothing. However, with this Inside Track glitch technique, you can ensure that you always win.

Here's what you need to do:

1. Head to the Inside Track area in Diamond Casino.

2. Place a maximum bet on your selected horse.

3. After the start of the race, immediately press the "Home" button on your controller. This should exit the game and bring you back to the Xbox menu or PS4 dashboard.

4. Wait for a few seconds, then navigate back to the Online tab and load GTA Online once again.

5. Once you're back in Diamond Casino, head back to the Inside Track area.

6. Check if the game has saved your progress and if your bet amount is still there.

7. Place a maximum bet on the same horse again, and wait until the race is over.

8. If you followed the steps correctly, your horse would win, and you will receive a handsome payout of 20,000 casino chips.

9. Repeat the process and enjoy your free chips!

Why does it work?

The Inside Track glitch technique works because the game does not save the progress of the race until it's completed. If you immediately exit the game after starting the race and before it finishes, the game won't recognize the race as complete, and, thus, does not save your progress. Therefore, you can replay the race and ensure that you win every time.

Conclusion

With the Inside Track Glitch technique, you now have an easy and quick way to grab 20K casino chips in a flash. Use your chips to purchase items such as exclusive cars, clothing, and decorations in the casino store. However, you should note that using any cheat code in GTA Online may result in a ban or other consequences. So, use it at your own risk, and enjoy the game responsibly. Happy gaming!
