We purchased the Goronya 3x1 HDMI Switch Selector so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.

 

When looking for an HDMI switcher, some consumers want the most minimal option they can find. Meet the Goronya 3x1 HDMI Switch Selector. It has no remote, outputs to HDMI female, and relies on the user being nearby to switch inputs, but it supports 4K video at 30Hz and is HDCP 2.2 compatible. Best of all, it’s one of the cheapest 2.2-compatible switches out there, and it just works. For the right consumer, this switch is a perfect solution to expand the number of HDMI inputs in your setup.

 
##   Design: Basic but solid  
 

The Goronya HDMI switch can operate up to 1080p/60Hz or 4K/30Hz. It has no remote, so switching inputs involves pressing the manual select button on the switch until the correct input is selected. There are three total HDMI inputs and one HDMI output, all housed in a shiny metallic body. While the body doesn’t look very luxurious, it’s sturdy and compact, and the switch has a steel-braided cable for HDMI output. The steel braid ensures that the cable never breaks from blunt force, but that does not make the cable immune to degradation from twisting over time.

 

The Goronya’s major design flaw is its lack of an AC adapter or other dedicated power device. Because it inherently draws power from whatever input devices it’s connected to, this can cause interference in the switch’s function with specific products--notably, the Playstation 4, the Apple TV, and the Roku. These devices never truly “power off” their HDMI signal, so auto-switching may not work properly with these devices plugged in.

 
The Goronya switcher is pretty spartan, little more than a handful for ports and an LED light to indicate which input is active.
 
##   Setup Process: Some unfortunate oversights   
 

To set up the Goronya switch, we plugged our PC, Nintendo Switch, and Playstation 4 into the HDMI inputs, and we connected the output cable to our BenQ HT3550 using an HDMI male to female adapter. In setup, it’s already apparent this switch is designed for TV use: it comes with no remote, meaning the switch must be in an easily accessible location. However, most projectors are ceiling-mounted, so the switch must either be located on the ceiling or connected to a male to female adapter. We feel that this inconvenience could have been easily solved with a remote or a standard USB female output, since HDMI cables tend to be male on both sides.

 
##   Features & Performance: Fairly bare-bones  
 

The Goronya switcher is pretty spartan, little more than a handful for ports and an LED light to indicate which input is active. It outputs up to 4K at 30Hz and is HDCP 2.2 compliant, so while you can’t watch movies or game at 60Hz you don’t have to worry about compatibility with Blu-ray players or streaming sites. It also supports HDR, 3D output, and Dolby TrueHD audio to make the best use of your playback devices. Additionally, it has automatic switching, so it will switch to a newly activated input. On average, it takes about nine seconds to switch inputs. 

 

The Goronya switch doesn’t support HDMI 2.0, unfortunately. With HDMI 1.4 output, you may lack the bandwidth to support the maximum output of your devices. Given that since the switch is only capable of 4K at 30 Hz, however, you’ll likely never find yourself pushing against the data limits of 1.4. 

 
It outputs up to 4K at 30Hz and is HDCP 2.2 compliant, so while you can’t watch movies or game at 60Hz you don’t need to worry about compatibility with Blu-ray players or streaming sites.
 

The Goronya also lacks some quality-of-life features, such as a remote and a Picture-in-Picture mode, but it does offer solid, reliable performance. Over time, the switch may degrade because of its exposed design, since the cables and ports are free to twist and bend.

 
##   Price: Ridiculously cheap  
 

For about $15, the Goronya 3 Port HDMI switch is a great budget option. It’s not the most convenient option out there, but it has HDCP 2.2 compatibility, a rarity at this price point. If you want to upgrade to a model with a remote, a 3 port, 4K/30Hz switch with HDCP 2.2 compatibility should start at about $30.

 
##   Goronya 3x1 HDMI Switch Selector vs Smartooo 23031 HDMI Switcher  
 

If you’re looking for a more fully-featured model, the Smartooo 23031 HDMI Switcher is about $30 and offers three inputs, a remote, HDCP 2.2 compatibility, and 4K/60Hz playback. It’s a great value for its features and rock-solid performance, though it does cost twice the MSRP of the Goronya. That said, doubling the price means you’re still only paying $15 more, and the Goronya feels comprehensively like a more modern, user-friendly switcher.

 

 

 
The Goronya 3x1 HDMI Switch Selector is a no-frills package.
