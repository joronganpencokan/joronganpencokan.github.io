The European retailer Smyths Toys has launched a pre-registration page for future orders of Xbox Series X, which, among other valid features, includes a banner with the recently revealed Halo Infinite, which states interesting details.

According to the British Retailer Smyths Toys, a dedicated page for Xbox Series X future orders was launched, and it also has some information about Halo Infinite. And this is where things get really interesting. As per the listing, the description of the game mentions the following about the multiplayer component of the game:
 
In addition, some sources close to the production told Windows Central site that the multiplayer part of Halo Infinite might be offered as free-to-play, just like Call of Duty: Warzone which is part of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.
 
“We’ve previously reported that the multiplayer for Halo Infinite might be free-to-play, in the same vein as Call of Duty: Warzone being available without buying Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. If so, it’s possible that the campaign and multiplayer could use separate clients but they are intended to ship alongside each other,” sources close to Windows Central said.
 
Of course, the largest campaign in the game is unlikely to be free-to-play.
 
Recall that Halo Infinite will release on Xbox Series X, Xbox One, and PC in Holiday 2020.
