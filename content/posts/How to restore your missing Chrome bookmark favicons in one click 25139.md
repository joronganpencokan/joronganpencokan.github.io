Say Goodbye to Boring Bookmarks: Restore Chrome Favicons in ONE Click!

When it comes to saving our favorite web pages, bookmarks are a lifesaver. They allow us to quickly access frequently used websites and keep track of interesting articles, videos, and other online resources we come across. However, the default bookmark icons in Google Chrome can be pretty bland and unappealing, making it hard to distinguish between different bookmarks at a glance. Fortunately, there's a simple solution: restoring Chrome favicons with just one click!

What are favicons, you ask? They're those tiny icons that appear to the left of the website name in your browser's address bar, tabs, and bookmarks list. Favicons are often the logo or symbol of the website, making it easy to recognize and differentiate between different sites. However, Chrome's recent update replaced favicons with generic squares or circles, making bookmarks look dull and indistinguishable.

Luckily, restoring favicons is a quick and easy process that can make your browsing experience much more visually appealing and enjoyable. Here's how to do it in just one click:

1. Install the Chrome extension "Restore Chrome favicons" from the Chrome Web Store. You can find it by searching for the extension name or following this link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/restore-chrome-favicons/dnhpdbgnodnakfillkkaeoglgngliafp.

2. Once the extension is installed, click on the icon in your browser's toolbar (it looks like a green star with the letters "RCF" inside).

3. Select "Restore favicons" from the drop-down menu that appears.

4. Wait a few seconds for the process to complete. The extension will automatically retrieve and update the favicons for all of your bookmarks, one by one.

5. Refresh your bookmarks page and enjoy the new and improved icons!

It's that simple! With just one click, you can restore the original favicons for all of your bookmarks in Google Chrome. This can make it much easier to recognize and access the sites you frequent most often, saving you time and effort in the long run. Plus, it can make your bookmarks page look much more visually appealing and organized.

So if you've been struggling with boring bookmarks in Chrome, don't despair. Try out the "Restore Chrome favicons" extension today and see how much of a difference it can make in your browsing experience. With just one click, you can transform your bookmarks into a visual feast for the eyes!

Chrome has an annoying habit of losing track of the saved favicons associated with bookmarks. Sometimes this occurs after a crash, but I've seen it just randomly happen as well. It has happened to me every six months or so, and a quick search finds a ton of Redditors and others complaining about the issue. The above image is what I woke up to recently on my main machine.

The prevailing wisdom is that you have to find and delete your Chrome profile, and then set up a brand new profile. That's time-consuming and annoying. Fortunately, there's a quick hack that seems to provide a quick fix. It's a bit crude, but all the best hacks are, aren't they? 
This time, all my bookmarks were generic, across all my bookmark folders. So what did I do? I selected one folder containing a relatively large group of bookmarks (in this case, about a hundred), and opened them all in a new window.
This will definitely strain Chrome, but if you don't open too large a folder, it should work. It's definitely fun watching all those tabs open back up. As they do, Chrome appears to retrieve and reset each bookmark's favicon. Fortunately, fixing one folder seemed to have convinced Chrome to fix them all.   
As you can see, I got all my icons back. What's really cool is that this process seems to restore all Chrome's favicons, not just those in the folder that was opened as tabs. 
So, one final disclaimer: This is a hack. It worked on my Chrome more than once, but there's no guarantee it will work for everyone. YMMV. That said, it's an easy enough fix that it's worth a minute to try. If it does what you want, hey, you've saved ton of hassle and time. And if it doesn't, well, you've wasted all of one mouse click.
What about you? Has this happened to you? Did this fix work on your machine? What other Chrome oddnesses have you experienced? Let us know in the comments below.
