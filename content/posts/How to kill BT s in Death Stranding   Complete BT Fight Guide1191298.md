In the world of Death Stranding, the BT (Beached Things) are a constant threat that players must face. These creatures lurk in the shadows, waiting to attack the player and drag them to the other side. To succeed in the game, you must learn how to master the ultimate BT fight guide and unleash your inner hunter.

The first step to mastering the BT fight guide is to understand the enemy. BTs are invisible to the naked eye, so players must use a device called an Odradek Scanner to locate them. The Odradek Scanner emits a sonar pulse that reveals the BTs' location, and their movements can be tracked by following the sound it emits.

Once you have located a BT, the next step is to prepare for battle. The best way to do this is to equip yourself with a Grenade Pouch and a Strand, which is a weapon used to bind the BTs. Grenades can be used to destroy BTs, but it's essential to throw them accurately. Players must aim for the BT's weak spot, which is located above its head. A well-aimed grenade can instantly take out a BT.

The Strand is a rope-like weapon that players can use to bind the BT and keep it in place. This weapon allows players to get close to the BT without it being able to attack. Once the BT is bound, players can attack it with a weapon of their choice.

To maximize the effectiveness of the Grenade Pouch and the Strand, it's essential to upgrade them as much as possible. Upgrades to these weapons allow players to carry more grenades and bind the BTs for longer periods.

Another critical aspect of the ultimate BT fight guide is understanding the different types of BTs that players will encounter. There are several types of BTs, including the normal BT, the Catcher, and the Higgs BT. Each type of BT requires a different approach and requires players to adjust their strategy accordingly.

In conclusion, mastering the ultimate BT fight guide is crucial to succeeding in Death Stranding. Players must understand their enemy, prepare for battle, and upgrade their weapons to stand a chance against the BTs. By unleashing their inner hunter and taking on each challenge one at a time, players can conquer the BTs and save humanity from extinction.
