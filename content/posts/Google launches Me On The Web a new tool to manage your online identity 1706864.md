Me On The Web makes managing your online identity easier, you can set up alters which will notify you if your email address or name are mentioned on the web — you were able to create this type of alerts before but now is simpler–, the tool also provides alerts with automatically suggestions search terms that you may want to consider monitoring.
 
Me On The Web also provides a little more help with this new tool with resources such as, remove pages or sites from the search results and manage your online identity that it would be a great idea to check them out.
 
“… your online identity is determined not only by what you post, but also by what others post about you — whether a mention in a blog post, a photo tag or a reply to a public status update. When someone searches for your name on a search engine like Google, the results that appear are a combination of information you’ve posted and information published by others.” Google explains.
