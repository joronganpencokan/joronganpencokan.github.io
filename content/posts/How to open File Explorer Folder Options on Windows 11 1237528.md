Windows 11 includes an updated version of File Explorer that retains the same classic look but with a new minimalistic menu that only shows basic commands. As a result, the commands have been reorganized, making it more difficult to find, including the Folder Options to customize File Explorer.
 
Since the “View” tab is no longer part of File Explorer, most of the commands and options have been relocated to three new menus, including “Sort and group options,” “Layout and view options,” and “See more.”
