# Revolutionize Your Workflow with the Game-Changing Additions to Google Workspace's Arsenal!

In recent months, Google Workspace has added new features and updates that have revolutionized the way businesses and individuals work. These additions have made Google's suite of tools more powerful, intuitive, and easy to use. Whether you're an entrepreneur, a small business owner or an employee working in a large corporation, these new features will help you streamline your workflow and help you save time—ultimately boosting your productivity.

## Smart Canvas

Google Workspace's new Smart Canvas gives users the ability to bring together various files, tools, and apps into an interactive space. Smart Canvas makes it easy to collaborate with team members and clients by integrating Docs, Sheets, Slides and various other tools. This feature goes beyond the basic collaboration many people are used to on Google Docs or Google Sheets.

Within Smart Canvas users can access the following:

- Google Meet picture-in-picture to run video meetings.
- Time tracking integration to ensure everyone stays on top of project deadlines.
- Easy access to Google Drive and Tasks.
- The ability to add comments in-line among inline documents and videos.

Smart Canvas acts as a one-stop-shop for everything you need to collaborate on with your team.

## Smart Compose in Google Chat

Google Workspace's Smart Compose feature has long been a favorite of Google Docs and Gmail users. It reduces the time spent drafting emails, suggesting complete sentences when users start typing. Now, this feature is available in Google Chat—Google's business messaging service—helping users type faster and meaningfully during conversations with colleagues and clients. 

Smart Compose in Google Chat uses machine learning to generate suggested responses that match the tone and style of the message. It understands commonly used phrases and vocabulary to give relevant suggestions.

## Google Meet Updates

Google Meet's new updates offer a more collaborative, interactive experience that's designed to facilitate a closer interaction between teams. Users can enjoy high-quality audio and video conferencing, thanks to the recent improvements that make meetings better than ever before.

Recent updates to Google Meet include:

- Hand-raising feature, which makes it easier for team members to request to speak during a meeting.
- Polls integration, which helps to facilitate more engaging meetings and offers a quick way to know where everyone stands.
- Breakout rooms that allow users to divide larger meetings into smaller discussions among smaller groups, making it easier for team members to work outside of the larger discussion.

## Other Updates

Additional Google Workspace updates include:

- A new integrated workspace in Gmail that makes it easier for users to access other Google Workspace apps without leaving the Gmail interface.
- The Google Workspace marketplace offers enhanced search capabilities to enable you to find the most relevant apps for your workflow quickly.
- The new Google Drive Content Delivery features enables businesses to securely and easily deliver large files in a more streamlined process.

These new features and updates have revolutionized the Google Workspace experience. They make it more intuitive to collaborate with team members, facilitate better user experiences, and save time while boosting productivity. If you haven't already, start taking advantage of these updates to get the most out of Google Workspace.

Updates are coming to Google Workspace and Meet, as well as a new Spaces feature, to try and make hybrid in-office/remote working conditions smoother for everyone.

 

First up is Spaces, which is a new, well...space that's intended to make it easier for teams to collaborate across different schedules and time zones. It's a bit like Slack, except with an intended focus on work and integration with other Google Workspace functions like Docs, Sheets, and Calendar.

 

Incidentally, Calendar is getting a new update that will let you set your location for the work day (Office or Home, for example). It a small thing but knowing where everyone is working from on a given day should make it easier to schedule meetings and accommodate attendees.

 

For more casual work-related exchanges, Google Meet calling is also being added to Workspace via the Gmail app. It'll be on mobile first, but the plan is to allow co-workers to spontaneously call each other and send notifications to whatever Gmail-using device they're working on.

 

Finally, there's Companion Mode, which is headed to Google Meet and is meant to make hybrid meetings feel less like in-office versus at-home exchanges.

 

"With Companion mode, I can host or join a meeting from within a conference room using my laptop while leveraging the in-room audio and video," said Sanaz Ahari, Google's Senior Director of Product Management, in the announcement.

 

Spaces should be publicly available now and will be seeing several more updates in the future, and location settings in Calendar should also be available.

 

No specific timeline has been given for the expanded Google Meet calling functions, though. We do know that Google Meet's Companion Mode is planned to roll out this November, at least.
