# Unleash Devastating Destruction with Guided Bombs in War Thunder: Learn How to Dominate the Skies Now!

Are you looking for a new way to dominate the skies in War Thunder? Look no further than guided bombs. These powerful weapons allow you to target and destroy enemy vehicles with pinpoint accuracy. In this article, we will explore the basics of guided bombs and teach you how to use them effectively.

## What are Guided Bombs?

Guided bombs are a type of weapon that allow you to steer your bomb in mid-air, giving you greater control over your attack. There are two main types of guided bombs in War Thunder: Laser Guided Bombs (LGBs) and TV Guided Bombs (TGBs). LGBs use laser targeting to guide the bomb to its target, while TGBs use a camera in the bomb to guide it.

## How to Use Guided Bombs

Using guided bombs in War Thunder can be a bit tricky, but with practice, you can master the art of precision bombing. Here are the basic steps to using guided bombs effectively:

1. Choose the Right Aircraft: Not all aircraft in War Thunder are capable of carrying guided bombs. Make sure to choose an aircraft that is equipped for this type of attack.

2. Target Enemy Vehicles: Find your target on the ground and mark it with your targeting system (either with a laser or via the camera). You may need to fly low and slow to get an accurate lock on the target.

3. Release the Bomb: Once you have a lock on your target, release the bomb and begin guiding it to your target. Your bomb will move in a straight line until you start making adjustments.

4. Adjust Your Course: Use the controls to steer your bomb towards the target. You will need to constantly adjust your course, as the bomb will continue to move forward even if you stop making adjustments.

5. Hit Your Target: When you are in range, it is time to detonate your bomb. Be sure to time your explosion carefully for maximum damage.

## Tips for Success

Using guided bombs in War Thunder takes practice and patience. Here are some tips to help you improve your bombing skills:

- Practice, Practice, Practice: The more you use guided bombs, the better you will become. Take time to practice using them on the ground to understand how they work.

- Watch the Weather: Wind can affect the trajectory of your bomb, so keep an eye on the weather conditions before starting your attack.

- Be Patient: Guide your bomb slowly towards the target, making small adjustments as needed.

- Be Aware of Enemy Defenses: Guided bombs are not invisible, and enemy defenses can shoot them down. Take some time to scout out your target area before committing to an attack.

## Conclusion

Guided bombs are a powerful weapon in War Thunder when used correctly. By choosing the right aircraft and practicing your bombing skills, you can become a devastating force in the skies. Follow these tips and you'll be dropping bombs with pinpoint accuracy in no time.

War Thunder is a free-to-play military vehicle combat game that is available on several platforms. There are over 2000 historically accurate aircrafts, helicopters, tanks, warships and other combat vehicles from WW2 and the Korean War. Bombs are one of the most frequently used weapons in the multiplayer game. But none are as deadly as the guided bombs. Here is everything you need to know about the guided bombs in War Thunder.
 
## How to Use TV Guided Bombs in War Thunder
 
Guided bombs are a part of aerial weapons which allow you to hit targets on the ground from a high altitude. Here is how you must use Guided bombs in War Thunder:
 
- Open the TV Guide system
 - Lock the enemies in your target
 - Ensure that your aircraft has an altitude of more than 12,000 metres and the range is more than 7 kms.
 - Also, you must release the bomb a little above your area if impact as it will eventually roll down to your target.

 

 
Another useful tip that you should keep in mind is to escape the area as soon as you release the bomb. This is because the AA system in the game is quite overpowered. You must stay out of sight which is why we have suggested keeping a distance of atleast 7 kms.
 
This is why you must have a fast aircraft that can help you gain enough altitude. Since there is no additional boost on the guided bomb itself, it’s vital that you release it at the right altitude and trajectory. However, once you get accustomed to how this weapon functions – then, there is no stopping you.
