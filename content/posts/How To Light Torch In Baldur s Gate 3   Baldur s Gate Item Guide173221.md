Baldur's Gate 3 is a game filled with challenges and surprises, keeping gamers on their toes at all times. One of the most essential items in this game is the torch, which not only helps illuminate the surroundings but also provides warmth in cold environments. However, finding and igniting a torch in Baldur's Gate 3 isn't as straightforward as it seems. In this guide, we will unveil the secret technique to ignite your torch, so you don't miss out on this game-changing item.

Step 1: Find the Torch

The first step towards igniting a torch in Baldur's Gate 3 is to find one. Torches can be found in various locations, from buildings to caves to abandoned mines. They are usually located in dark places where visibility is low, so keep an eye out for them. You can also purchase a torch from a merchant, but this may not be the most cost-effective method.

Step 2: Equip the Torch

Once you have found a torch, the next step is to equip it. To equip a torch, open your inventory and select the torch from the list of items. Click on the torch, and you will see an option to equip it. Once equipped, you can easily switch between your weapons and the torch when needed.

Step 3: Find a Light Source

To ignite your torch, you need a light source. This can be a campfire, a torch that is already lit, or any other source of fire. You cannot light a torch in a dark area without a light source, so always make sure you have one available.

Step 4: Light Your Torch

Once you have a light source, it's time to light your torch. With the torch equipped, move towards the light source and interact with it. You will see an option to light your torch. Click on it, and your torch will be ignited. Congratulations! You have successfully lit your torch and can now explore the dark areas of Baldur's Gate 3 with ease.

In conclusion, igniting a torch in Baldur's Gate 3 is a game-changing item that can make your life a lot easier.
