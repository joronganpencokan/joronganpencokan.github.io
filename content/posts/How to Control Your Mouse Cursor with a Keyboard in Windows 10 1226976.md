# Unlock the Secret to Faster Computer Navigation: Master Keyboard Control of Your Windows 10 Mouse Cursor Now!

Navigating a computer system using the mouse alone can be an arduous and time-consuming task. Fortunately, Windows 10 offers a more efficient way to navigate - using keyboard shortcuts to control the mouse cursor. This method of navigation is particularly useful for individuals who have difficulty using a traditional mouse or those wishing to improve their productivity. 

Here are some of the most useful keyboard shortcuts for controlling the mouse cursor in Windows 10.

## Moving the Cursor

The first step to learning how to control the mouse cursor using the keyboard is to understand how to move it. There are several ways to do this:

- Press the **Ctrl** key and the **arrow keys** to move the cursor in the desired direction. 
- Press the **NumLock** key and use the **number pad** to move the cursor. 
- Use the **Tab** key to move between various elements on the screen, such as buttons, links, and text fields.

## Selecting Items

Once the cursor is in the desired location, the next step is to select an item. This can be done using the following keyboard shortcuts:

- Press the **Spacebar** to select an item. 
- Use the **Enter** key to select an item. 
- Press the **Ctrl** key and the **arrow keys** to move the cursor between items.

## Scrolling

One of the most common tasks when using a computer is scrolling through pages of content. Here are some useful keyboard shortcuts for scrolling:

- Use the **PgUp** and **PgDn** keys to scroll up or down one page at a time. 
- Press the **Ctrl** key and the **Up Arrow** or **Down Arrow** to scroll up or down one line at a time.

## Zooming In and Out

If you want to zoom in or out of a document or webpage, here are the shortcuts you can use:

- Press **Ctrl** and the **+** key together to zoom in. 
- Press **Ctrl** and the **-** key together to zoom out.

## Moving Between Open Windows

When you have multiple windows open on your desktop or laptop, keyboard shortcuts offer an easy way to switch between them. Here are some of the most commonly used keyboard shortcuts:

- Press **Alt + Tab** to switch between open windows. 
- Press **Ctrl + Alt + Tab** to open the Task View and switch between open windows. 

## Conclusion

Keyboard shortcuts for controlling the mouse cursor can save time and increase productivity. While it may take some practice to master them, it will be worth the effort in the long run. By learning how to navigate your Windows 10 computer using the keyboard, you'll be able to work faster and more efficiently.

There are myriad reasons why you may want to configure your keyboard to use as a mouse. Maybe you use a battery-powered wireless mouse, and it’s run out of charge, or your mouse has stopped working, and you need to make changes within Windows 10 to fix it … but you can’t because your mouse doesn’t work!
 
Perhaps more importantly, controlling the mouse with a keyboard can be helpful for people with mobility issues in their hands, as pressing keyboard keys is easier than zipping your hand across a desk.
 
Whatever your needs, we’re here to show you how to control your mouse with a keyboard in Windows 10.

## Control Your Mouse with a Keyboard
 
The keyboard mouse control feature is actually built into the “Ease of Access” settings in Windows 10. Go to the Window Settings app. (You can just type “settings” into the Start menu to find it quickly.)
 

 
In the Settings window click “Ease of Access,” then “Mouse” in the pane on the left, and click the slider underneath “Control your mouse with a keypad” to “On.”
 
You’ve now switched on “Mouse Keys.” By default, you need to have Num Lock active for this to work, at which point you can use the Num Pad at the right side of your keyboard to use Mouse Keys.
 
We recommend increasing the Pointer speed slider to maximum – otherwise the pointer is very slow. Ticking the “Hold the Ctrl key” box is also a good idea, as this lets you speed up and slow down the pointer speed using the Ctrl and Shift keys as modifiers.
 
Here are the numpad keys and their corresponding functions:
 
## What If You Don’t Have a Numpad?
 
Not everyone’s lucky enough to have a numpad. The fact is that they’re not that frequently used, so many laptops and some standalone keyboards don’t include them.
 
Fear not, though, because you can get a third-party MouseKeys-type app that lets you set your own keys, and it’s overall much more robust than Windows Mouse Keys.
 
Enter NeatMouse. Using this lightweight app you can set whatever keys you want to act as mouse directions.
 
Click the icon marked below to reveal more options where you can change which keyboard buttons act as which mouse buttons, as well as the mouse speed and whether you want NeatMouse to switch on as soon as you boot your PC.
 
You can also change the key that activates the keyboard-as-mouse functionality, while the “Emulate only with” drop-down lets you set a button to hold in order for it to work.
 
You can even set multiple profiles using the green “+” icon, having different setups depending on what software you’re using and so on.
 
## Conclusion
 
Some people don’t like installing third-party apps when they don’t have to, but if you want a more customizable and smooth way of emulating your mouse functionality to your keyboard, then we’d pick NeatMouse over Windows Mouse Keys. Other than giving you more control, the mouse pointer runs much more smoothly as well, where the Windows option can be a bit choppy.
 
It’s your call, though, and at least now you know you have options!
