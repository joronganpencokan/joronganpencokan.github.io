# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Highlight In PDF - Master This Game-Changing Hack Now!

As we move to a more digital and paperless world, the use of Portable Document Format (PDF) files has become more prevalent than ever. PDFs are lightweight, easy to share, and can be accessed on any device with a PDF reader.

However, one issue that many people face when working with PDFs is the inability to highlight texts, making it difficult to communicate important points, share notes or arguments with peers, or emphasize the critical elements of an article or document.

Fortunately, there's a game-changing hack that helps you highlight in PDF quickly, easily and efficiently.

## Understanding the Issues that Using Highlighting in PDFs Solve?

PDFs provide a way to share documents, making it easier to read and view the content without the need for access to the original files, which can be a significant advantage at times. However, there are times when the information in the document may need to be presented in a different format.

For example, if you were to read a book or a research paper, you might want to highlight key information such as critical points, definitions, quotes that resonate with you, or sections that interest you the most.

In such cases, traditional methods of highlighting, underlining, or using a marker pen, would not be effective in PDF files. Without these highlighting capabilities, it is difficult to create emphasis or compare sections of a text against each other visually.

## Mastering the Game-Changing Hack to Highlight in PDF

The following fantastic hack can transform your experience when working with PDFs and enable you to highlight essential pieces you need to capture within any texts. This hack can be broken down into three easy steps:

### Step One: Download a PDF Reader

The first and the most critical step is getting and downloading a PDF reader that supports highlighting. This can either be done for free or by purchasing a software application. Adobe Acrobat Reader, for example, is one such tool that can be downloaded from the internet and installed to allow easy reading of PDFs.

### Step Two: Select the Text to Highlight

Once you have your PDF reader installed, you need to open the relevant PDF document and then identify the specific text you want to highlight.

To do this, all you need to do is click on the text which needs to be highlighted and then select the highlight option. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+H on Windows or Command+H on a Mac) to get to the highlight function in the PDF software.

### Step Three: Use Color Codes to Highlight

After opening your PDF file, selecting the text and opting for the highlight option, the new text can be highlighted in the color of your preference.

In most cases, highlighting in yellow makes the most readable statement, however, using different colors for different sections of the text can create a visually meaningful representation to you, allowing you to access the highlighted area more easily.

## Conclusion

The ability to highlight key information within a PDF is crucial for anyone who works with PDF files regularly. This game-changing hack makes the task of highlighting in PDF files easy and efficient, enabling you to communicate and share important points in a visual and colorful manner.
