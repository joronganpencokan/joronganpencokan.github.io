After installing the app, open it. You will be on the app’s main screen. There, you will find the option to change the server path. Also, you can define a default charset. If your site is in English, you do not need to use this option ever. But if the language if the site is different. You can use this option to use a charset.  For the sake of the tutorial, create a simple HTML file on your desktop, laptop or even your smartphone. You can use the HTML code below or use your own file.
 
<html><head></head> <body> <h1> Welcome to my site. </h1> <p>This is a demo </body> </html>
 
After you have copied the HTML file to your Android device, open Tiny Web Server app and select Start Server. Select the HTML file you’ve just copied. Add /index.html at the end. You have successfully hosted your first site on an Android device.
 
So how can other people view your site? You can use this app with any dynamic DNS update client (example: DuckDNS) to make your site available to people on a network. Keep in mind that your device needs to be online. This is particularly useful if your website is relatively basic and you need to host it for a college project but don’t want to spend money on web hosting. If you have a spare old Android device lying around, you can make good use of it.
