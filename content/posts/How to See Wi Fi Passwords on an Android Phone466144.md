## Unlock the Secret Trick to Easily Reveal Wi-Fi Passwords on Your Android Phone!

Have you ever been in a situation where you desperately need to connect to a Wi-Fi network, but you can't seem to remember the password? Or maybe you want to connect to a network that someone else has already connected to, but you don't want to bother them for the password? Well, fear not, because there is a secret trick that can help you easily reveal Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone!

### Step 1: Root Your Android Phone

Before we begin, it's important to note that this trick requires you to root your Android phone. Rooting gives you "superuser" access to your phone, allowing you to perform actions and access files that are normally restricted. While rooting your phone does come with some risks, such as voiding your warranty and potentially bricking your device, the benefits can be worth it if you know what you're doing. There are many tutorials and resources available online that can guide you through the rooting process, so do your research and proceed at your own risk.

### Step 2: Download a Wi-Fi Password Revealing App

Once you have rooted your phone, you can download and install a Wi-Fi password revealing app. There are many available on the Google Play Store, but one of the most popular and highly rated is called "WiFi Key Recovery". This app is free to download and use, but it does contain ads.

### Step 3: Give the App Superuser Access

After you have installed the app, open it up and grant it superuser access when prompted. This will allow the app to access the password files on your phone that are normally hidden.

### Step 4: View the Wi-Fi Passwords

Once you have given the app superuser access, it will display a list of all the Wi-Fi networks that your phone has connected to in the past. Simply tap on a network name to reveal the password. You can also share the password with others via text message or email, making it easy to connect to the same network on other devices.

### Step 5: Protect Your Wi-Fi Passwords

While this trick can be incredibly useful in certain situations, it's important to remember that Wi-Fi passwords are sensitive information that should be kept private. If you are using a password revealing app, make sure to keep your phone secure and avoid sharing your passwords with anyone who shouldn't have access to them.

In conclusion, now that you know the secret trick to easily reveal Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you can connect to networks with ease and avoid the hassle of forgetting or asking for passwords. Just remember to proceed with caution when rooting your phone and protect your passwords from prying eyes. Happy Wi-Fi surfing!

Then, open the .conf file using a text editor, which is probably built into your file manager application. If not, add one to your shopping list and head over to the Play Store! You should be able to read the password in plain text.

 
## Solutions


If that didn’t work, or you don’t want to root your phone, you could reset the password. Note: Rooting your Android device may result in voiding its warranty. Suppose you have no access to the router. In that case, you can try an app like WifiAnywhere, which also comes in handy if you’re trying to access Wi-Fi from an unfamiliar place. It lets you log in to routers connected to the network. Some routers have this as a standard option, which is very useful.
Alternatively, suppose you’re connected to your friend’s Wi-Fi network. In that case, you can access her router setup and check the password under Wi-Fi security. If all else fails, try contacting your service provider for support.
