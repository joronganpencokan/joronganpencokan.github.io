You'll Never Believe How To Find Out If Your Crush Blocked You On Snapchat - Find Out Now!

Have you ever been blocked on Snapchat by your crush or significant other but didn't know how to confirm it? It can be frustrating and even hurtful not to know why someone has blocked you or what you might have done wrong. But fear not! There is a way to find out if someone has blocked you on Snapchat, and we're going to share it with you now.

Firstly, let's understand what it means to be blocked on Snapchat. When someone blocks you on the app, they remove you from their contact list and prevent you from sending them snaps or messages. Your account will no longer show up on their app, and they won't receive any notifications from you.

So how do you confirm if someone has blocked you on Snapchat? The easiest way is to search for their username in the app. If you can't find them in your contacts list or by searching with their username, they may have blocked you.

Another way to tell if you have been blocked is if your messages to them show as undelivered or if your snaps to them are not opened. However, this could also mean that they have simply deleted their account or removed you from their contact list.

If you suspect that you have been blocked and want to be absolutely sure, you can try creating a new Snapchat account and searching for their username again. If you can find them with your new account, it is highly likely that you have been blocked from their original account.

It's important to remember that being blocked on Snapchat doesn't necessarily mean that the person dislikes you or wants nothing to do with you. There could be a number of reasons why someone might block you on the app. They could be going through a tough time and need space, they might not be interested in you romantically or even just not using the app anymore.

In any case, if you do find out that you have been blocked on Snapchat, it's important to respect the other person's decision and not continuously try to contact them or create new accounts to interact with them. It's best to move on and focus on other aspects of your life.

To sum up, if you suspect that someone has blocked you on Snapchat, there are a few ways to confirm it. Check if you can find them in your contacts or search by their username. If your messages and snaps are not being delivered or opened, this could also be a sign that you have been blocked. Lastly, creating a new account and searching for them again can provide further clarification. But remember, being blocked doesn't necessarily mean the end of the world. Stay positive and move forward with grace.

## Find Out If Someone Blocked Or Deleted You On Snapchat
 
There are two options for anyone to get rid of you on Snapchat. Either they can block or remove/delete you on Snapchat. During the process of determining whether you are blocked or not, we will also dig deeper and know if you are deleted or blocked.
 
Watch our video:
 
…or read the step-by-step instruction.
 
### Check Snap Score And Bitmoji
 
The first thing you need to check is the Snap Score and the Bitmoji of the suspected person’s profile. Snapscore is a number mentioned besides their Snapchat username, and Bitmoji is their Snapchat avatar. You can find both by going to the profile of the user.
 
If you are not able to see the Snapchat Score of that user, but you can still see their Bitmoji, then it is confirmed that they have deleted or removed you from their Friends list. 
 
However, if you can’t see both i.e, their Bitmoji and snap score, then it is possible that you have been blocked, and not just deleted.
 
Note that not seeing only the bitmoji does not mean anything as the person in question may have simply removed their bitmoji from Snapchat.
 
Also, while checking their snap score and Bitmoji, you can try adding them as friends by tapping on the ‘Add Friend‘ button on their profile. By doing that, if you’re able to add that person, then you are deleted and not blocked. However, if nothing happens when you tap on that option, then the chances that you’ve been blocked have gotten much higher.
 
But with this method alone, you cannot figure out if you are blocked or deleted. So, let us get to the second step.
 
### Search For User
 
I know that if the first step didn’t work in your favour then you might be disappointed, or maybe confused. But don’t worry, because there’s still hope.
 
In the second step, you can try searching for the user by their username if you remember it, or you can also search for them by their actual name. You can do so by tapping the Search option at the top of the Camera screen.
 
And if you’re able to see them in the search results, then they’ve just deleted or removed you. But if you can’t see them in the search results, then it is yet another sign that they’ve blocked you on Snapchat.
 
But wait! don’t jump to conclusions just yet, because it may be that the person has just deleted or deactivated their Snapchat account. You can only be sure after you’ve checked the last step.
 
### Make Sure They Haven’t Deactivated Their Snapchat Account
 
If your intuition is still telling you that you couldn’t be blocked by that person, then you can give it one last shot. Because it can still be possible that the person hasn’t blocked you, instead, they’ve deleted/deactivated their Snapchat account.
 
So to be sure of that, you can perform the last step from someone else’s Snapchat account. This further means that you can search for that user from one of your friends’ Snapchat account. And if you can’t see that person even from another account, then it means the person has deactivated their Snapchat account. But if you can see their account, then sadly, you have been blocked.
