If you live with someone, whether a spouse, significant other, friend, or family member(s), you’re bound to run into issues where one person is disturbing the other. This can be especially true when watching TV on an actual television set, which is why some opt for headphones. However, since you can’t use regular headphones with most TVs, you’ll need a headset like the Hammo TV Wireless Headphones.
 
This stylish over-the-ear headset allows you to blissfully watch TV at any volume level without disturbing anyone else. With crisp, theater-quality sound, you’ll probably wonder why you hadn’t been using a TV headset sooner! The headphones connect to your TV via a wireless docking station which “uses low-latency wireless transmission technology to ensure the perfect synchronization of the TV picture and the sound of the headphones.”
 
The well-padded earmuffs and headband are so comfortable that you can wear them for hours without issue. That coupled with 50 hours of battery life and a range of up to 10 meters (approximately 33 feet) gives you a lot of usability and flexibility.
 
The Hammo TV Wireless Headphones are also Bluetooth enabled and can be directly connected (via audio cable) to any device for regular usage. Since they fold up for easy storage, you can even take them with you on the go to use with a mobile device and/or laptop.
 
Without further ado, let’s get into setting up and using this quality TV headset.
 
## What’s in the Box
 
In the box you’ll find everything needed to set up and power the Hammo TV Wireless Headphones. The wireless docking station comes in two pieces but it very easy to put together: the two legs of the metal stand fit snuggly into the base.
 
Here is everything that’s included:
 
- Hammo TV Wireless HeadphonesWireless Docking StationPower AdapterMicroUSB cableTwo Audio CablesRCA Adapter CableUSB to Audio Charging CableUser Manual and Safety InstructionsLimited Warranty

 
## Setting Up Hammo TV Wireless Headphones
 
Before getting started, it’s important to know that these headphones will only work with TVs that have an RCA audio OUT or 3.5mm headphone audio OUT jack. However, if you have optical digital audio OUT or digital audio OUT, you can purchase an optical to analog converter.
 
Setting up the Hammo TV Wireless Headphones is so much easier than expected. I’ve tried some TV headphones in the past and they required you to go into your TV Settings and tinker around with some things. They were also a pain to connect wirelessly.
 
These, on the other hand, are the complete opposite. It literally took all of five minutes to get the headphones connected and functioning. Here’s what you have to do:
 
- Attach the power adapter to the microUSB cable. If you plan to power the docking station via USB instead of a power outlet, you can skip this step.Connect the microUSB cable to the docking station and plug the other end into an outlet or USB port.

 
- Connect one end of the audio cable to the docking station.Connect the other end of the audio cable to the RCA adapter cable (if your TV has an RCA audio out jack) or directly into the headphone jack on your TV.

 
- If you are using the RCA adapter cable, connect that to the RCA OUT jacks on your TV.Turn on your TV if it isn’t already on.Turn on the docking station using the power button on top. (Hold for one second to turn on, and hold for three seconds to turn off.)

 
- Turn on the headphones using the power button on the back of the left earmuff and wait for them to automatically pair. This should only take a couple of seconds.

 
### Two Is Better than One
 
If desired, you can pair another Bluetooth headset of your own to the docking station. Just press the power button once, and it will go into pairing mode. Turn on the second headset, and put it into pairing mode. Again, within seconds it’s connected, and now two people can listen to one TV at the same time.
 
## Using Hammo TV Wireless Headphones
 
With the headset successfully set up and paired, just power them on whenever you want to use them. They’ll automatically connect to the charging station and start playing your TV audio. The LED indicator will illuminate green, letting you know that it’s on and working.
 
I noticed that I needed to completely mute the audio on my TV in order to hear only through the headphones. Otherwise, the audio plays through both the TV and headphones at the same time.
 
Doing this also allowed me to see that there is a tiny delay in the audio playing through the headphones. However, I was only able to notice this when hearing the audio through the headphones and TV at the same time, proving how insignificant the delay is.
 
To adjust the volume of the headset, press the power up and down buttons on the back of the left earmuff. These buttons also double as previous and next buttons when connected to mobile devices. (Press and hold to return to the previous track or skip to next track.)
 
### Charging the Headphones
 
When the battery is low, the LED indicator on the headphones will flash and play a “low battery” warning tone. You’ll need to use the USB to audio cable for charging: the audio end goes into the headphone’s audio port, and the USB ends plugs into the docking station.
 
The LED indicator will flash yellow while charging and remain steady when charging is complete.
 
It takes around five hours to completely charge when almost dead. Also, the headphones won’t operate while charging – not that you’ll be able to use them anyway with the short charging cable that’s included.
 
## Final Thoughts
 
I know from personal experience that it’s no fun watching TV in one room while someone else is loudly watching TV in another room. You have to constantly increase your volume, leading the other person to increase their volume, and it goes back and forth until someone decides to turn off their TV in an effort to compromise. With a TV headset like this, all of that ends.
 
The Hammo TV Digital Wireless Headphones are easy to set up and even easier to use. They’re also extremely comfortable, have incredible sound, and great range for walking around your house. Obviously, you don’t have to live with someone to use them, especially since they double as a regular headset, but if you don’t live alone they’ll ensure that everyone is happy!
