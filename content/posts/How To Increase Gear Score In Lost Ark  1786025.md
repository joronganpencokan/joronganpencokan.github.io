# Unlock the Secrets to Skyrocketing Your Gear Score in Lost Ark - Your Ultimate Guide!

Lost Ark is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that has taken the gaming world by storm. With captivating gameplay, stunning graphics and a plethora of challenges to conquer, it's not surprising that Lost Ark has gained a massive following of gamers worldwide.

One of the most significant challenges in Lost Ark is to increase your Gear Score (GS). Having a high Gear Score is incredibly important as it determines your strength and survival rate in battles, making it an essential aspect of your gameplay. Fortunately, there are several tips and strategies that you can utilize to skyrocket your Gear Score in Lost Ark.

## 1. Gear Enhancements

One of the most fundamental ways to increase your GS is through gear enhancements. Enhancing your gear involves upgrading your current gear to improve its stats, making it more powerful. You can enhance your gear by using enhancement materials such as stones, scrolls, and gems.

It's essential to note that enhancing your gear comes with risks. Sometimes, a failed enhancement can lead to your gear's accidental destruction or a downgrade in stats. Therefore, it's crucial to have a backup gear in case of a failed enhancement.

## 2. Gear Refinement

Another way to increase your GS is through gear refinement. Refining your gear involves adding special effects known as inscriptions that alter the stats of your gear. These inscriptions can increase your offensive or defensive powers, making you more formidable in battles.

To refine your gear, you will need inscription materials such as dust, emblems, essence, or alloys. Like gear enhancements, refining your gear comes with risks. Therefore, you need to have backup gear in case of failure.

## 3. Gearing Upgrades

Gearing upgrades involve upgrading your current gear to a higher tier or purchasing better gear. This option may require in-game currency or real-life purchases, making it the most expensive option.

However, upgrading your gear to a higher tier can have significant effects on your GS, increasing your character's overall strength significantly. Purchasing high-quality gear can make your character more potent, allowing you to tackle even the most challenging of battles.

## 4. Gearing Gems and Runes

Gearing gems and runes are essential aspects of Lost Ark's gameplay. Gems and runes work to slot into your gear, providing unique bonuses to your stats. Each gear type can hold specific gem and rune types and has a limited number of slots available for use.

To increase your GS, you must equip all the available gem and rune slots on your gear. As you progress through the game, you'll encounter many different types of gems and runes that provide unique bonuses to your gear, making it essential to keep an eye out for them.

## 5. Dungeons and Raids

Dungeons and raids in Lost Ark offer an excellent opportunity to increase your GS. You can earn loot, gear, and materials by successfully completing these challenging battles. Additionally, these areas provide an excellent opportunity to earn experience points for your character.

Dungeons and raids come in various tiers, each providing unique rewards and challenges. You must push yourself to complete higher-tier dungeons and raids to earn better rewards and elevate your character beyond the competition.

## Conclusion

Unlocking the secrets to skyrocketing your Gear Score in Lost Ark can be a challenging task, but with determination and persistence, you can achieve it. By utilizing the tips and strategies outlined above, you can elevate your character's strength, making you a formidable opponent in Lost Ark. Remember, it's essential to keep a backup gear to avoid losing your hard-earned enhancements or refinements, making your GT journey smoother and more enjoyable.

The ability to increase Gear Score in Lost Ark can help you progress better and faster in the game. Lost Ark features 3 different tiers of score levels, and as you pass through each of them, you will only find your gear getting better. Considering the initial complexity of this process, it’s easy to see why players may struggle to understand it. In this guide, we will ease the dilemma by showing how you can increase your gear score in the game. We will show you all three tiers in detail and what you need to do to progress to the next tiers.
 
## How to Increase Gear Score in Lost Ark?
 

 
### Tier One (250-600) – Increase Gear Score in Lost Ark
 
Upon reaching level 50 in Lost Ark, you will have the ability to acquire item levels with gear scores between 250 – 302. Once you reach a score of 250, you should start attempting runs at the Chaos Dungeon. You can find this dungeon in the North Vern.
 
Once here, you need to begin at Stage One, Level One. You need to aim to collect enough rare items and equipment that will facilitate your objective of getting your score to 302.
 
Upon reaching a score of 302, you can proceed to aim for a target score in the range of 340 – 600. To get to this range, you can opt for upgrading your North Vern or Shushire rare equipment to +2 for each of them. Alternatively, you can choose to upgrade rare gear items to +15 to help you hit the 600 mark.
 
However, if grinding through a game seems like your cup of tea, you will find that upgrading your North Vern or Shushire rare equipment to +2 for each of them will take you to a score of 460. Once at 460, you can move on to 600 by going to the Citadel of Illusions and the Aureslud Palace. Here, you can collect all the necessary items to craft your very own set of legendary items.
 
### Tier Two (600-1100)
 
Upon making it to 600 points, its time to head to the second tier of the gear scores in Lost Ark. This tier will begin with Stage 1 and Level 1 of the Chaos Dungeon Yorn.
 
To get to 802 points, you need to get your hands on a complete set of rare items. Recycling older gear into newer ones can help you achieve your desired target, so make sure to pay close attention to that too.
 
Apart from these items, you will also need to place your focus on gems, as they will help develop the skills of your character.
 
Upon successfully making it to 802 points, you can opt to grind and boost all your pieces by +2 each to get to 840 points. Alternatively, you can upgrade all your gear by +15 to reach the 1100 mark and get into tier 3.
 
If you wish to grind through the game, you will need to go to Abyss Dungeons. Here, you need to engage in the Forgotten Forge and Road of Sorrow to get all the items you need to get epic sets. Just like we mentioned earlier, recycling will help you progress further in this process. Doing so will help you get to 960 points.
 
From there, you can run through the Underwater Sanctuary, Perklous Abyss, and the Oblivion Sea at Abyss Dungeon to gather materials. With these materials, you can craft a set of legendary gear, which you can use to get to a gear score of 1100 in Lost Ark.
 
### Tier Three (1100 – 1575)
 
Getting to a gear score of 1100 in Lost Ark will take you into tier three. Here, you will find yourself taking on Stage 1 and Level 1 of Punika. To get to a score of 1302, you will need to collect a full set of items. Again, recycling here is key. You can completely avoid grinding by upgrading all rare items by +15.
 
Choosing to grind will see you run through the Punika map again, although at Stage 2 and Level 1. Once you reach a gear score of 1370 in Lost Ark, you can move on to a score of 1415. To do so, you can opt to either go through the 3rd stage and Level 1 of Punika or keep recycling to get a boost of +15 per item.
 
At 1415 points, you can reach 1460 points by upgrading all items by +18. You can also do so by running the Valtan Legion Raid on normal mode. Upon upgrading all items by +18, you will reach a score of 1460.
 
Once at 1460, you can go to 1490 by upgrading your current gear by +20 each. You can also do so by running through Biackiss Legion Raid in the Hard difficulty. Once at 1490, you can target a score of 1340 by upgrading all your gear by +25. Alternatively, you can also run through the Abrelshud Legion Raid with the normal difficulty setting. At 1340, upgrade all gear by +25 to finally reach a score of 1575.
 
So there you have it. This is all you need to do to increase your gear score in Lost Ark. As you can see, doing so can be extremely easy, depending on the method you choose. Either way, one thing is guaranteed, and that is the fact that you will find upgrading your gear score advantageous.
