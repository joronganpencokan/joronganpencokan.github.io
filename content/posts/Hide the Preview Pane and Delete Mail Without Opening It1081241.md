# You've Been Checking Your Emails All Wrong! Learn the Game-Changing Trick to Avoid Opening Them Ever Again

As a busy professional, you probably spend hours each day checking your emails, responding to messages, and sorting through spam. It's a necessary evil, but what if there was a way to avoid opening your inbox altogether? That's the game-changing trick we're about to reveal.

First, let's discuss why it's important to limit our email consumption. Checking emails constantly can lead to distractions, decrease productivity, and even cause burnout. Research shows that it takes an average of 23 minutes to return to a task after being interrupted. So, if you're constantly checking your emails, your efficiency levels are sure to take a hit.

Now, for the big reveal. The trick to avoiding opening your emails ever again is to use a virtual assistant or AI-powered email management tool. These AI-powered assistants can sort and prioritize your emails for you, so you only need to open the ones that actually matter.

Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant are constantly getting smarter and more capable. They can manage your inbox for you, sorting messages by sender, topic, urgency, and more. Plus, they can provide helpful summaries of your emails or read them aloud if you need to multitask. Imagine being able to respond to an urgent email while you're driving, without ever having to take your eyes off the road.

But virtual assistants aren't the only way to automate your email management. AI-powered tools like SaneBox, Boomerang, and Mailstrom can also help you prioritize your inbox. These tools use machine learning to understand your email habits, so they can organize your inbox more effectively.

For example, Boomerang can help you schedule emails to be sent later, follow up on important messages, and even remind you to reply to certain emails after a set period of time. SaneBox, on the other hand, can help you filter out spam, save important messages for later, and even unsubscribe you from unwanted newsletters.

The options are endless, and the best part is that these tools are often easy to integrate with your existing email provider. Many of them offer free trials, so you can test them out before committing to a subscription.

In conclusion, if you want to avoid opening your emails ever again, it's time to embrace AI-powered assistants and email management tools. With their help, you can stay on top of your inbox without sacrificing productivity or burnout. It's the game-changing trick you've been looking for.

This article explains how to hide the Mail application's Preview pane so you can delete suspicious emails without opening them. Instructions cover Mail on Mac in OS X Tiger and later OS X and macOS versions.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Select the vertical line between the message list and preview pane and drag left until the preview disappears.To delete multiple emails from the messages list, select the messages you want to delete > Delete.To bring the preview pane back, select and drag left from the right edge of the Mail interface.

 
##   Remove the Message Preview Pane  
 

When you open Mail on Mac, by default, you see the Mail sidebar on the left of the Mail interface. (If you don't see this sidebar, select Mailboxes on the Favorites bar, which is beneath the toolbar.) When you select a mailbox in the Mail sidebar, each email message in that mailbox appears in a list, including the message's sender and subject, the date you received the email, and—depending on your settings—the first line or so of the email body.

 

When you select an email in the messages list, the email opens in the message preview pane.

 

To hide the message preview pane in ​Mail on Mac, select the vertical line that separates the list of messages from the message preview, then drag the line to the right until the message preview pane disappears.​

 
##   Delete Emails Without Seeing Previews  
 

To delete multiple emails from the messages list, select the message you want to delete, then press the Delete key.

 
##   Bring the Message Preview Pane Back  
 

To bring the message preview pane back, hover at the far right edge of the Mail interface until the cursor changes to a left-pointing arrow. Select and drag left to reveal the message preview.

 
To select multiple messages, press and hold the Command key while selecting messages. To select a range of messages, press and hold the Shift key, select the first message in the range, then select the last message in the range.
 
##   Why Disable the Preview Pane?  
 

By default, Mail on Mac in Mac OS X and macOS displays email messages when you select an email in the message list. It also displays all the emails you select, even if you select messages for deletion. For privacy and security, however, you may not want previews of your emails. For example, opening a suspicious email may let the sender know that you opened it, confirming an active email address. Or, you don't want others to see your messages.
