Step 4: The Morgue

The fourth key can be found in the morgue, which is located in the underground section of the mansion. To reach it, you'll need to enter the hidden passage behind the bookshelf in Alexa Carlisle's office. Once you've reached the morgue, look for a locker on the left side of the room. The key is inside the locker.

Step 5: The Private Cinema

The fifth and final key is located in the private cinema, which is on the top floor of the mansion. To reach it, you'll need to disguise yourself as a member of the staff and enter through the staff entrance on the ground floor. Once you're in the cinema, look for a safe behind the movie screen. The key is hidden inside the safe.
