# Rev up Your Engines for the Ultimate Gran Turismo Sport Update 1.61 - Patch Notes Unlocked!
The Gran Turismo Sport community is in for a treat, as the latest update, version 1.61, has just been released. With the update, the game’s developers Polyphony Digital have introduced new customizability options and fixed a range of bugs, making for a much smoother racing experience. Here are the patch notes for you to pore over before you start up your engines.

## Fixed Bugs
Polyphony Digital has focused on fixing issues related to cars and tracks. One such issue was with cars having a delayed response while braking. This has been resolved so expect to see a significant improvement in car performance. A bug where hitting walls would lead to a big loss in speed has been fixed, providing a more realistic racing feel as cars may bounce off walls and continue on their way. Other glitches, including a problem with the Nissan GT-R NISMO GT3 Race Car crashing during online races, have been resolved, providing a hiccup-free racing experience.

## New Features
Patch 1.61 includes the new option for players to make their own decals, providing much greater customization options for racecars. Players can also upload their custom designs to the games online livery collection to share with others.

## New Cars
Gran Turismo Sport has welcomed two new cars into the game – the Lotus type 125 and the Mazda RX-VISION GT3 Concept. Both cars have unique features, providing players with new experiences and driving dynamics to master.

## New Track
The Laguna Seca race track, located in California, has been added to the game, offering players a new challenge to tackle. The track combines both tight turns and steep elevation changes, providing a real test of driving skill.

## Conclusion
The Gran Turismo Sport Update 1.61 brings a host of new features and fixes to the game. Players can expect better racing experiences with the bug fixes, while the new decals options, cars and track provide ample motivation to fire up the game and rev up their engines. The update is free for all players, making it accessible to a larger number of the games’ community as compared to paid DLC updates in other games. Get ready to experience the ultimate racing game with these new updates which are now live.

Gran Turismo Sport has been updated to version 1.61. The official changelog reveals what to expect. First of all, the GT Sport update 1.61 is not very extensive.
 
Polyphony Digital announced months ago that support for Gran Turismo Sport will come back this year. The latest update, which raises the PS4 title to version 1.61, is correspondingly small.
 
There were also various improvements and adjustments. The changelog for the game update 1.61 shows, for example, that one or the other screw was turned in the slipstream setting as Realistic. Below you can see the complete changelog:
 
### Gran Turismo Sport Update 1.61 Changelog:
 
1. Livery Editor
– The Pilot Sport logo from Michelin’s high-performance sports tires is now available. To access the new tire sticker, select “Wheel” and “Tire Sticker” (Standard Sticker) in the Livery Editor.
 
– Balance adjustments have been made to the slipstream setting “Real.”
– Various other issues have been addressed.
 
As mentioned at the beginning: You should no longer expect major content updates for Gran Turismo Sport. This is simply because the developers of Polyphony Digital have been concentrating on Gran Turismo 7 for some time.
 
The racing game was recently announced with a first trailer and gameplay scenes. Gran Turismo 7 will appear for the PS5 sometime later. The publisher Sony and the developer Polyphony Digital have so far not given any details about the new title.
