# Unlock the Secrets to Easy Windows 10 Installations with this Simple Bootable USB Trick!

In today's technology-driven world, the use of the latest and most cutting-edge operating systems is essential. Windows 10 is one of the most widely used operating systems today, offering enhanced features and functionalities that improve computer usage in various ways. However, the process of installing Windows 10 can be a bit challenging and cumbersome for some users, especially those who are new to the process. Fortunately, there is a simple and easy trick to make the process much more manageable- creating a bootable USB.

A bootable USB is essentially a flash drive that can be used to start a computer and run an operating system. A bootable USB is a fast and reliable way of installing Windows 10, and it comes with several benefits compared to traditional installation methods. This trick is incredibly useful for users who are installing Windows 10 on more than one computer or reinstalling the operating system frequently.

Here's how you create your bootable USB

1. Firstly, you will need a USB flash drive and a Windows 10 ISO file (a disk image of the operating system that you can download from Microsoft). Ensure that your flash drive has at least 8GB of space.

2. Download Rufus, a small utility program that helps create bootable USBs, from the official website. Rufus is free software and is commonly recommended.

3. Connect the USB to your computer and open Rufus. Rufus should automatically detect the USB drive.

4. Click on the "Select" button and choose the Windows 10 ISO file you have downloaded previously.

5. Under the 'Device' section, make sure your USB drive is selected.

6. Choose 'MBR' under the 'partition scheme' dropdown, ensure 'FAT32' file system is selected, and check the 'Quick format' and 'Create a bootable disk using' dropdown.

7. Click 'Start' and let Rufus do its thing.

8. Once Rufus completes the process, you can eject the USB drive and restart the computer it is to install Windows 10 on.

9. Insert the USB drive into the computer's USB port and press the appropriate key to boot from the USB. This key varies depending on the computer manufacturer and model, but it should be displayed on the screen as your computer starts up.

10. Follow the standard Windows 10 installation procedure, and you're good to go!

Creating a bootable USB is an easy and quick solution for anyone looking for a more efficient way of installing Windows 10. It saves both time and effort and provides a helpful solution to anyone who frequently installs the operating system or wants to install the OS on multiple computers. With the steps outlined above, you'll be well on your way to seamless Windows 10 installations!

As of July 29th, 2015, Windows 10 has started its great rollout, leaving in its wake a swarm of Windows 7 and 8 users just waiting for the upgrade notification to pop up in their system tray. If you’re tired of waiting for the automatic download and upgrade, you could always go and create your very own Windows 10 boot disk on a USB disk.
 
This, of course, leaves the question of how, but that’s what we’re here for, right?
 
## Getting the Boot Disk Installation Tool
 
Click here to go to Microsoft’s website, where you can download a Windows 10 Download/Installation tool. Be sure to select the one corresponding to the architecture (32 bit or 64 bit) that the system you’re using is on.
 

 
To check what architecture you’re on, open Start, right-click “Computer” and select “Properties.”  On the screen that follows, under “System” you’ll see “System-type” 32 or 64-bit (For Windows 8 users: simply open your Start screen and type “See if you have a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows.”).
 
## Installation
 
Once the Windows 10 Download Tool has finished downloading, open it and begin walking through the installer. Before proceeding, make sure you have a USB stick with 3GB+ of storage space to install Windows 10 on and that any important data on that stick has been backed up, as it will be wiped in this process.
 
“Upgrade this PC now” will start a Windows 10 download and allow you to upgrade your current PC to Windows 10. If you want to create clean install media for this machine or another machine, select “Create installation media for another PC.”
 
Under “Language,” select your preferred Language.
 
“Edition” depends on a multitude of factors. If you’re running normal Windows, you should stick with Home. If you run Windows 7/8 Professional, however, select Windows 10 Pro. If this is for a completely new PC with no prior Windows installation, choose whichever edition you’re willing to pay for.
 
“Architecture” offers 32-bit, 64-bit or both. 32 and 64 bit require at least 3GB of storage on your USB drive, while having both versions on the stick will require at least 6GB. Choose this based on the architecture of the system you’ll be installing it on.
 
“USB flash drive” will install the appropriate files to a flash drive. Downloading an iso file will allow you to burn a system image to a DVD, but we’re not doing that in this guide. To learn how to burn ISO images to a disc, check out Tanmay’s guide here.
 
At this stage you’ll be selecting the USB drive you want to use for the install. Make sure you’re familiar with the drive letter/volume label of your USB stick, or simply consider removing the sticks you aren’t going to use during this installation to minimize the risk.
 
Now you will need to wait. Let the download and installer run on its own. Once it’s finished, you will have a Windows 10 boot disk from which you can use to install Windows 10!
