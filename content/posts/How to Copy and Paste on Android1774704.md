As a modern human being, the art of copy-pasting has become an integral part of our daily lives. Whether you are a student trying to complete a research paper, a professional trying to quickly send an email or simply a casual user trying to share funny memes with friends - copying and pasting saves us a lot of time and effort.

But, did you know there is a secret Android trick that can make you a copy-paste ninja in seconds?

Firstly, let's discuss the traditional method of copying and pasting on Android devices. You might know this already - we often have to select the text we want to copy, tap on “Copy” within the context menu, navigate to the desired location, tap on “Paste” and voila! We have successfully copied and pasted.

But what if we told you there is a simpler and quicker way to copy and paste text on Android?

Introducing “Smart Text Selection,” an incredible feature introduced in Android 8.0 Oreo that allows users to copy and paste text with just one tap.

Here’s how to use this feature:

Step 1: Double-tap on any word you want to copy or highlight any word and press and hold.

Step 2: Smart Text Selection will automatically select the relevant words, and present you with some quick actions like “Copy” and “Search” at the top of your screen.

Step 3: Simply tap on “Copy” and the text is now available to use elsewhere. It's that easy!

Using Smart Text Selection is incredibly convenient and efficient as it eliminates several steps in the traditional method of copying and pasting.

Apart from this trick, there are a few other helpful tips for copy-pasting on Android devices:

1. Quickly copying an entire paragraph is as simple as tapping the text twice, and from there, just click “Select All.”

2. Once you've copied a text, you can paste it in many other places by simply pressing the paste button and selecting the desired destination.

3. Lastly, try using other third-party apps like Gboard, which has built-in clipboard management.

In conclusion, copy-pasting text can be tedious and time-consuming, but with this secret Android trick, you can become a copy-pasting ninja in seconds! Give it a try and see how much time you can save.
