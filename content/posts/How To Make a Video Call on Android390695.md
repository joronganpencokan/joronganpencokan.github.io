Title: Unlock the Secret to Effortless Video Calls on Your Android Device - The Ultimate Guide!

Introduction:

Video calls have become an essential part of our daily lives, especially during the current times, where we need to stay connected with our colleagues, friends, and family members while being physically distant. However, many of us struggle with poor connectivity, awkward camera angles, and low-quality audio during video calls, which can ruin the entire experience.

If you're an Android user, you're in luck because this ultimate guide will help you unlock the secret to effortless video calls on your device.

Section 1: Ensure Stable Network Connectivity

The first and foremost thing you need to consider before making a video call is a stable network connection. Video calls require a robust and stable internet connection to stream audio and video seamlessly. Therefore, check your internet connection speed by using a speed test app and ensure it has a download and upload speed of at least 2 Mbps.

Also, ensure that you are in an area with a strong Wi-Fi signal or have a consistent cellular network signal. You can use a network signal booster app to enhance your smartphone's network reception.

Section 2: Optimize Your Camera and Audio Settings

The camera and audio settings play a crucial role in how you appear and sound during a video call. Start by finding a well-lit room with natural lighting and adjust your camera angle to be at eye level. This will create a more natural and relaxed appearance during a call.

Next, adjust your audio settings by turning off any unnecessary background noise, such as fans or music. You can also use a noise-canceling app to eliminate any background noise during the call.

Section 3: Use Video Conferencing Apps and Services

Android smartphones have numerous video conferencing apps and services available in the Google Play Store. However, not all of them provide the same quality and features. Therefore, it is essential to select the right app or service for your video call needs.

Some popular video conferencing apps for Android include Zoom, Google Meet, Skype, and Microsoft Teams. Ensure that you download and use the latest version of the app to have access to its latest features.

Conclusion:

Effortless video calls on your Android device are possible if you follow the above tips and recommendations. Ensuring stable network connectivity, optimizing your camera and audio settings, and using the right video conferencing apps can make a significant difference during your calls.

By following this ultimate guide, you can have productive and enjoyable video calls with your colleagues, friends, and family members without any hassle.

This article shows you how to make a video call on Android, including the built-in option, Google Meet, and third-party video chat apps.

 
### 
What To Know
 
- Built-in: Open the Phone app > select a contact, and tap the video icon underneath their name.
 - Google Meet: Select a contact and click the video icon. Meet sends them a live video feed, so they know who's calling.
 - If you don’t want to use Meet, there are many free video-calling apps available on Android.

 
##   How To Use Android’s Built-in Video Calling  
 

Depending on your device and carrier, it’s possible to make video calls from your phone app directly. 

 
- Open the Phone app.
 - Select the contact you wish to call.
 - Tap the video icon underneath the contact's name to begin a video call.
 - Wait for your contact to answer. If your contact’s phone doesn’t support video chat, you’ll automatically be switched to an audio call.

 

The only downside to Android’s built-in calling is that you’ll only be able to start a video call with someone who also has this functionality.

 

Open the Phone app.

 

Select the contact you wish to call.

 

Tap the video icon underneath the contact's name to begin a video call.

 

Wait for your contact to answer. If your contact’s phone doesn’t support video chat, you’ll automatically be switched to an audio call.

 
##   How To Make a Video Call With Google Meet  
 

Google’s video-calling app, Meet, is preinstalled on most Android phones. This app is fully integrated with first- and second-generation Pixel, Android One, and Nexus devices, which means you can use it right from your Phone and Contacts apps.

 

Meet isn’t built in with all Android devices, making it less seamless than Apple’s FaceTime, but it’s still easy to use even if you don’t have one of the devices mentioned above. Meet is also available in Apple's App Store, so you can use it to contact iPhone users, as well.

 
- If it's your first time using Google Meet, agree to the terms of service and give the app access to your microphone and camera. It will use your Google account to place calls.
 - Select a contact to call.
 - Tap the video call icon. Meet has a useful feature called Knock Knock that sends the person you’re trying to call a live video feed of you, so they know who they’re receiving a call from before picking up. The app also has a variety of filters and effects.
 - Invite contacts to connect. If a contact doesn’t have the app yet, you can tap Invite.

 
##   How To Video Chat on Android Using Third-Party Apps  
 

If you don’t want to use Google's option, there are many free video-calling apps available on Android. 

 

If it's your first time using Google Meet, agree to the terms of service and give the app access to your microphone and camera. It will use your Google account to place calls.

 

Select a contact to call.

 

Tap the video call icon. Meet has a useful feature called Knock Knock that sends the person you’re trying to call a live video feed of you, so they know who they’re receiving a call from before picking up. The app also has a variety of filters and effects.

 

Invite contacts to connect. If a contact doesn’t have the app yet, you can tap Invite.

 

Two of the best alternatives are Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, as you likely already have at least one of them as a text messaging app. 

 

Making a call with both apps is a nearly identical process. Find the person you want to talk to, select the video icon at the top of the screen, and your call should begin. For a group call, both Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp support video chats multiple people (Facebook Messenger up to 50, WhatsApp up to 8).

 

Alternatively, you can use video conferencing platforms like Zoom as a mobile video chat app. The one significant difference is that instead of directly calling someone, you’ll need to create a meeting and invite people. Zoom is a good option if you want to host a large gathering, as it supports up to 100 attendees.

 

To start a video call on Zoom for Android:

 
- Open the app and tap the New Meeting button.
 - On the next screen, tap Start a Meeting.
 - Select Participants at the bottom of the screen.
 - To begin inviting people to your meeting, tap Invite in the bottom left corner. You’ll be presented with a list of your email and messaging apps. Find the person(s) you want to invite from one of these, and Zoom will send an invitation link so they can join your meeting.

 

Open the app and tap the New Meeting button.

 

On the next screen, tap Start a Meeting.

 

Select Participants at the bottom of the screen.

 

To begin inviting people to your meeting, tap Invite in the bottom left corner. You’ll be presented with a list of your email and messaging apps. Find the person(s) you want to invite from one of these, and Zoom will send an invitation link so they can join your meeting.

 
No matter which video chat app you use, it’s best to connect to a Wi-Fi network, if you can. Video chats use a lot of data, so using a Wi-Fi connection won’t eat into your monthly data limit.
