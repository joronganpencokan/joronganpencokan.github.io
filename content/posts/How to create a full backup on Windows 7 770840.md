# Stop Losing Your Precious Files: Master the Art of Full Backup on Windows 7 Today!

Losing your files is a nightmare, especially if you have no backup. It can happen to anyone, at any time. Whether it is due to a system crash, malware attack, or accidental deletion, the consequences can be devastating. All the hard work, memories, and important documents gone in a flash. To prevent such a disaster, it is crucial to create full backups regularly. If you are using Windows 7, here is a step-by-step guide to mastering the art of full backup.

## Step 1. Choose Your Backup Destination

The first step is to choose where you want to save your backup. You can use an external hard drive, USB flash drive, network location, or DVD. Make sure that the destination has enough space to accommodate the backup files.

## Step 2. Open Backup and Restore

Click on the Start button, go to Control Panel, and select Backup and Restore. Alternatively, you can type "backup and restore" in the search box on the Start menu.

## Step 3. Select Backup Now

Click on the Backup Now button on the right-hand side of the window. You can also choose the "Set up backup" option to schedule automatic backups.

## Step 4. Choose What to Backup

You can either let Windows choose what to back up, or you can select individual folders and files manually. To do this, click on "Let me choose" and check the boxes next to the items you want to backup.

## Step 5. Configure Backup Settings

You can choose to create a system image, which is a complete copy of your Windows installation, along with your personal files. This is useful if you need to restore your entire system at once. You can also choose whether to encrypt your backup with a password, and whether to run the backup automatically on a schedule.

## Step 6. Start Backup

Once you have configured the backup settings, click on the Save settings and run backup button to start the backup process. This may take some time, depending on the size of the files and the speed of your computer.

## Step 7. Verify Backup Completion

Once the backup is complete, you should see a message confirming that the backup was successful. You can also click on "View Details" to see a log of the backup process. Make sure to check the backup destination to verify that all the files are there.

## Conclusion

Creating a full backup of your important files should be a part of your regular computer maintenance routine. Windows 7 makes it easy and convenient to do so, with the Backup and Restore feature. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can ensure that your files are safe and secure, and avoid the nightmare of losing them forever.

Microsoft has ended support for Windows 7 on January 14, 2020, which means that your device is no longer receiving security and maintenance updates, and there’s no more support from the company. 
 
If you are still using Windows 7, it’s now the time to upgrade to Windows 10, but before going through the process, it’s recommended to create a full backup with a copy of the installation as well as a copy of your settings, apps, and files, in case you need to roll back.
 
In the case that you are moving to a new clean installation of Windows 10, it’s also recommended to create a backup of your files stored on Windows 7, which you can then restore in the new installation.
 
In this guide, you’ll learn the steps to create a full backup and a file backup to protect your installation and files before upgrading to Windows 10. In addition, you will learn the steps to restore your computer if the upgrade presents any problems, and the steps to restore your files on Windows 7 on your new Windows 10 installation.
