On Windows 11, you can install network cameras in the same way as USB cameras through the Settings app.
 
Network cameras are devices that stream the data through the LAN (Local Area Network) using a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) configuration rather than transferring data through a USB cable. Usually the preferred choice of device for security and surveillance purposes.
 
Windows 11 supports discovery, pairing, configuring, and stream TCP/IP-enabled for major ONVIF Profile S-compliant camera brands. When you connect the new camera, the stream can be routed through the existing APIs to capture images, stream, or record videos using the default Camera or third-party application.
