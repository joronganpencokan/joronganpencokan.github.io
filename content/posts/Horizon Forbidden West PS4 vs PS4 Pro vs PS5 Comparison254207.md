Title: Top-notch graphics revealed: See the stunning differences between Horizon Forbidden West on PS4, PS4 Pro, and PS5!

Introduction:
One of the most eagerly anticipated games in recent memory, Horizon Forbidden West, is set to release on February 18, 2022. The sequel to the critically acclaimed Horizon Zero Dawn promises an immersive open-world experience set in a post-apocalyptic world filled with giant mechanical beasts. Fans of the series are eagerly awaiting the game's release, and the recent reveal of the differences between the graphics on the PS4, PS4 Pro, and PS5 has only heightened the excitement.

Section 1: PS4 Graphics

Horizon Forbidden West was originally planned to release on the PS4 and PS5, but due to the game's scale, the developers, Guerrilla Games, had to make some sacrifices in terms of graphics. While the graphics on the PS4 look good, they are not as detailed as those on the PS5. The texture quality is lower, and there are fewer environmental effects, such as volumetric lighting and reflection. However, the game still looks beautiful and has a lot of the same features as the PS5 version.

Section 2: PS4 Pro Graphics

The PS4 Pro version of Horizon Forbidden West is a step up in terms of graphics compared to its predecessor. The game's resolution is higher, and there are more detailed textures and environmental effects. The increased horsepower of the PS4 Pro allows for these improvements, but the game still falls short when compared to the PS5.

Section 3: PS5 Graphics

The PS5 version of Horizon Forbidden West is where the game truly shines. The graphics are stunning, with incredibly detailed textures and lifelike environmental effects. The level of detail in the game's foliage, water, and lighting is simply breathtaking. The game's resolution is also higher than the previous versions, allowing players to truly experience the vast open-world in all its glory. The PS5's SSD also helps to eliminate loading times, making the gaming experience seamless.

Conclusion:
Horizon Forbidden West promises to be one of the biggest games of 2022, and the differences between the graphics on the PS4, PS4 Pro, and PS5 showcase the evolution of gaming technology. While the game still looks good on the PS4 and PS4 Pro, the PS5 version truly stands out in terms of graphics. Fans of the series who have the PS5 will undoubtedly be treated to an unparalleled gaming experience that showcases the full potential of the console's capabilities.

Horizon Forbidden West is just around the corner and many people are wondering about the difference in performances in PS4, PS4 Pro, and PS5. And if you are planning to upgrade to PS5 this guide will help you whether it is worth the upgrade or if you should wait. So let us quickly check the performance comparison of PS4 vs PS4 Pro vs PS5 (Resolution mode) vs PS5 (Performance mode) for Horizon Forbidden West.
 
## Horizon Forbidden West PS4 Vs PS5 Comparison
 

 
- PS5 (Performance mode): This is the mode you should play if you love 60 FPS and high frame rates. Oh, and the Performance mode also has 4K just like the Resolution mode. While the resolution mode of this game may give crispier graphics, this mode is best suited to enjoy the high action. Not to mention this mode can come extremely handy if you like to play on a higher difficulty. That is because you can focus on your gameplay and won’t have to worry about any frame drops. And this is a completely subjective opinion but I highly doubt you will notice the slightly lower graphics when you have that high FPS.
 - PS5 (Resolution mode): Want to enjoy the vast wild world the Horizon Forbidden West has to offer? If yes then this mode is for you. You can run the game on 4K in this mode. The game offers almost cutscene quality graphics throughout your gameplay. It does come at a cost and that cost is 30 FPS. But it is not like the game is unplayable, if anything that is the furthest from the truth, as the game is equally enjoyable in the Resolution mode as it is in the Performance mode. It is just a matter of choice, if you want more frames in 4K go for the Performance mode. If you want the most visually appealing graphics and 4K then the Resolution mode is for you.
 - PS4 Pro: Horizon Forbidden West plays quite interestingly in PS4 Pro. And what we mean by that is it too lets you play at 4K with high-quality graphics just like the Resolution mode in PS5. Although it doesn’t perform the same as its PS5 counterpart. The graphics are still much better in PS5 as compared to PS4 Pro. But that difference is minor and you may only notice it when running the game side by side for comparison.
 - PS4: The base version of PS4 gets the job done right. You get to play the game in 30FPS at 1080p. While it may not sound that appealing when compared to the above performances, it isn’t that bad either. But Horizon Forbidden West is better optimized and can feel better than when you play Zero Dawn. The secret behind its performance in both the PS4 systems despite their power lies in checkerboard rendering.

 
That covers this performance comparison for how Horizon Forbidden west performs in PS4, PS4 Pro, and PS5. Don’t forget to check other our guides on whether you can download Horizon Forbidden West on Steam. And for more things gaming tune into Gamer Tweak.
