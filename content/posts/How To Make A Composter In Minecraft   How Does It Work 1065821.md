You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Make a Composter In Minecraft - And the Results Are Amazing!

Minecraft, the popular sandbox game with over 126 million monthly players, has made a name for itself with its creativity and building aspect. Not only can players create impressive structures and complex machines, but they can also engage in survival gameplay, including ways to maintain and manage the natural resources in-game. Composting, in particular, is an essential aspect of the game that any player should learn. Composting allows players to reuse green materials and turn them into bone meal, an excellent fertilizer that accelerates plant growth. In this article, we will show you how easy it is to make a composter in Minecraft and how it can improve your gameplay experience.

Step 1: Gathering the Materials

First, you need to gather the necessary materials:

1. 3 x Wooden Planks
2. 3 x Wooden Slabs
3. 4 x Wooden Fence
4. 1 x Fence Gate
5. 1 x Bucket of Water

You can gather these materials by chopping trees, mining wood, or trading with villagers. Once you have collected all the materials, proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Building the Composter

Now that you have all the necessary materials let's build the composter.

1. Start by placing three wooden planks in a row.

2. Place three wooden slabs on top of the planks to create a shallow box-like structure.

3. Surround the box with four wooden fences.

4. Place a fence gate on one side of the compost bin.

5. Finally, pour water from the bucket into the compost bin to activate it.

And that's it! You have successfully built a composter in Minecraft.

Step 3: Composting

To start composting, collect various green materials such as grass, leaves, or saplings. Place them in the composter by pressing the right mouse button. With enough green materials, you will notice the compost filling up, and the level will increase up to seven. Once the composter is full, you need to right-click on the compost to get bone meal.

Step 4: Using the Bone Meal

Bone meal is an excellent fertilizer that helps crops grow faster. Use it on any crop by pressing the right mouse button, and you are good to go. Bone meal is also useful for growing trees when planting saplings.

Final Thoughts

Composting in Minecraft is an exciting and beneficial process that helps players manage their resources and optimize gameplay. Building a composter only takes a few minutes, and the results are amazing. You can create an efficient farm or greenery in less time, and with less effort than ever before. The composter also adds an innovative spin to Minecraft's building aspect, allowing players to build a backyard garden, a farm, or even a park.

## How to Make a Composter in Minecraft
 

 
You can make a Composter by placing seven wooden slabs on the crafting table. If you don’t have enough wooden slabs, you can craft them by using three wooden planks and placing them in the bottom row of the crafting table. Once you have the slabs you require, get to the crafting table and place them in a U shape. That’s all you need to do.
 
Players can also collect it from villages. Yes, composters do spawn in the villages, but exploring the locality to find them can be hectic. Hence, the best way to build a composter is by using wooden slabs.
 
Once you have built the Composter, you can add unwanted plant materials to it. Each material has a probability of getting you a layer of compost. Now, this probability varies from item to item. Regardless, you will have to keep putting the materials and adding a layer of compost.
 
You will be able to collect bone meal only if you have seven layers of compost. Hence, it is advised to keep composting unwanted items frequently to get the seven layers of compost. Once you have the required layers, all you need to do and collect the bone meal. You can also place the composter on the upper side of the Hopper to automate the bone meal collection process.
