As the name suggests, The Recycler is a unique crafting hack that turns everyday recyclable materials into useful and sustainable additions to your rafting trip. All you need is some creativity and a commitment to reducing your environmental impact.

First, start by collecting your recyclables. Items such as plastic bottles, aluminum cans, and cardboard boxes make excellent building blocks for The Recycler. The possibilities are endless, so don't be afraid to get creative!

Now, it's time to put your crafting hat on. Start by cutting your recyclables into various shapes and sizes. Then, using hot glue or zip ties, begin piecing them together to form furniture, decorations, and even functional tools.

The Recycler is not only environmentally sustainable, but it also adds a unique touch to your rafting trip. Plus, it's a great way to involve your whole group in a fun crafting activity.

Not only will your Recycler creations create a memorable experience for your friends and family, but it will also help reduce the amount of waste left behind after your trip.
