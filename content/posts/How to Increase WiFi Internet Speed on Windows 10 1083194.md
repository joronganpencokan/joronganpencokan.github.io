Introduction

Are you tired of experiencing slow internet speeds on your Windows 10 computer? Do you struggle to enjoy online streaming, online gaming, or download large files due to weak WiFi signals? If so, then you have come to the right place. In this article, we'll reveal unbelievable ways to boost your WiFi internet speed on Windows 10, allowing you to get lightning-fast connections without any hassle.

Step 1: Choose the Right WiFi Channel

Did you know that the WiFi channel you use can affect your internet speed? By default, most routers use the same channel, which can lead to interference, resulting in slow internet speeds. Therefore, to boost your WiFi internet speed, you must select the right channel. 

To do this, press the Windows key + X and select "Command Prompt (Admin)." Then, type the command "netsh wlan show all" and press Enter. Look for the line "Radio types supported" and check if your router supports 2.4GHz or 5GHz. If your router supports 5GHz, switch to that channel as it has less interference. 

Step 2: Disable Background Apps

Windows 10 comes with many pre-installed apps that run in the background even when you aren't using them. These apps consume your computer's resources, including your WiFi bandwidth, resulting in slow internet speeds. To boost your WiFi internet speed, you must disable background apps.

To do this, open the Start menu and click "Settings" > "Privacy" > "Background Apps." Then, toggle off the apps that you don't need running in the background.

Step 3: Use a Quality Antivirus

While it's essential to have an antivirus installed on your Windows 10 computer, some antivirus programs can slow down your internet speed. Therefore, to boost your WiFi internet speed, use a quality antivirus program that doesn't consume too many resources.

Step 4: Update Your Network Driver

An outdated network driver can cause slow internet speeds. To boost your WiFi internet speed, you must update your network driver. To do this, go to the manufacturer's website and download the latest driver for your network adapter.

Step 5: Optimize Your WiFi Settings

Windows 10 uses specific settings that prioritize bandwidth for system updates and other Windows services, resulting in slow internet speeds. To boost your WiFi internet speed, you must optimize your WiFi settings. 

To do this, press the Windows key + R and type "gpedit.msc" and press Enter. Then, go to "Computer Configuration" > "Administrative Templates" > "Network" > "QoS Packet Scheduler" > "Limit reservable bandwidth." Double-click on "Limit reservable bandwidth," select "Enabled," and lower the bandwidth to 0-10%.

Conclusion

By using the above steps, you can boost your WiFi internet speed on Windows 10, allowing you to enjoy lightning-fast connections without lag or buffering. Remember, it's essential to keep your computer clean and up-to-date to maintain high-speed internet connectivity. So, go ahead and implement these steps, and start enjoying a faster browsing experience.

Accessing the Internet may not be a fundamental human right yet, but it does feel like an essential commodity since every part of the world is virtually connected to the rest via this complex web. Yet, the speed at which people are able to surf and browse varies from region to region. In the era of 5G networks, users have stopped thinking about the speed at which they browse the web. The internet speed is only given a thought when a video on YouTube starts buffering or when it takes two extra seconds for a website to load. Technically speaking, Internet speed refers to the speed at which data or content travels to and from the World Wide Web on your device, may it be a computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone. Internet speed is measured in terms of megabits per second (Mbps), which is calculated as the number of bytes per second of data that travels from the user’s device to the Internet viz upload speed and from the Internet to the device viz download speed. For the most part, you cannot change the speed you receive, but you can surely tweak your computer to optimize the available speed. So, how to increase internet speed on Windows? Well, there are a few different ways to maximize it, most of which revolve around changing your system configuration. Hence, we bring to you a perfect guide on how to increase WiFi internet speed on Windows 10.

### Method 8: Change Bandwidth Limit for Windows Update
 
Windows 10 gives you the option to set a limit for the amount of bandwidth to be used for Updates. This limit is applicable for both, updating applications and Windows operating systems.

Once the limits are changed, test your internet speed and look for changes.
 
### Method 9: Pause Windows Updates
 
Random and Automatic operating system updates are hated by all Windows users. Pausing these updates may seem drastic, at first but, every time Microsoft releases a new update, they are directly downloaded in the background. The downloading process consumes an alarming amount of data that is capable of reducing the internet speed. Luckily, you can easily pause these updates & increase WiFi internet speed in few easy steps:
 
1. Go to Settings > Update & Security, as earlier.
 
2. Click on Advanced Options.
 
3. Finally, in Pause updates section, choose any suitable day in the Select date dropdown list.
 
Note: You can pause updates from a minimum of 1 day to maximum period of 35 days.
