Horizon Zero Dawn 2 Goes Bigger & Better: Get Ready for Co-Op Play, Enormous Worlds & A Full Trilogy!

Are you ready to explore the vast expanses of the Horizon Zero Dawn universe once again? While the original game took us on a thrilling journey through a dystopian world overrun by robotic creatures, its upcoming sequel promises to take things to an entirely new level. Horizon Zero Dawn 2 is set to be bigger, better, and more expansive than its predecessor, packed with exciting features and gameplay mechanics that fans of the series are sure to love.

The first major addition that fans can look forward to in Horizon Zero Dawn 2 is co-op play. While the first game was a single-player experience, the sequel will allow players to team up with their friends and take on the robotic horde together. This collaborative gameplay is sure to add a whole new layer of excitement to the Horizon Zero Dawn universe and will undoubtedly be a hit with fans.

But co-op play is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Horizon Zero Dawn 2's new features. The game will also feature enormous worlds to explore, each filled with their own unique set of challenges and obstacles. From harsh environments to dangerous creatures, players will need to use all of their skills to survive in the world of Horizon Zero Dawn 2.

Another new feature that fans will love is the expanded crafting system. In the original game, players could craft items and weapons to help them on their journey. In the sequel, this system has been taken to a whole new level, with even more items to craft and new crafting mechanics to master. This will give players even more control over their gameplay experience, allowing them to tailor their characters to their unique playstyles.

Of course, to truly take advantage of all of these new features, players will need to sink some serious time into the game. That's why Horizon Zero Dawn 2 will be the first in a full trilogy of games. This will allow players to immerse themselves fully in the world created by developer Guerrilla Games, exploring every nook and cranny and experiencing the full scope of the game's story.

All of this adds up to an incredibly exciting prospect for fans of the series. With co-op play, enormous worlds, an expanded crafting system, and a full trilogy on the way, Horizon Zero Dawn 2 promises to be the most immersive and exciting game in the series yet. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer to the series, there's no doubt that Horizon Zero Dawn 2 is a game that you'll want to keep an eye on. So get ready, because the Horizon Zero Dawn universe is about to get a whole lot bigger and better!

Recently, there was a new job announcement related to Horizon Zero Dawn 2. Today, the sources of the VGC website went one step further. Sony Interactive Entertainment has ambitious plans for the post-apocalyptic open-world brand, whose first game came on the market in 2017 and was sold more than ten million times. Together with guerrilla games, the franchise is to become a trilogy.
 
It is reported that Hermen Hulst, a former guerrilla veteran and co-founder of the Dutch studio, took over the management of Sony Worldwide Studios, is likely to have a not so considerable influence, replacing Shuhei Yoshida. The website further reports that the development of Horizon Zero Dawn 2 began shortly after the first game was released. The original plan was to bring the sequel to PlayStation 4. It is now speculated that the developers will concentrate entirely to bring Horizon Zero Dawn 2 on PS5.
 
According to the website, the sequel should have a gigantic scope with a larger game world and at the same time offer the opportunity to explore this world more freely than after the predecessor. People allegedly involved also indicated that a co-op function was included. However, whether this supports the main story or is provided in a separate mode, is not confirmed.
 
It is also said that Guerilla Games is planning to release an independent co-op demo, with the option of transferring the progress to the later full version of Horizon Zero Dawn 2. The source is no longer sure whether this plan is still current. The co-op feature was originally planned for the first game. However, it was discarded so that the development team could focus on other areas of the title.
 
And the system architect of the PS5 even provided information on how the DualSense controller of the new hardware could affect the game. He emphasized that the adaptive triggers will help players to get a feel for a bow that shoots an arrow.
