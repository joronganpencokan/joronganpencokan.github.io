# 10 Surprising Hacks To Double Your Samsung Galaxy S10 Battery Life - It's Easier Than You Think!

Have you ever been frustrated with the battery life of your Samsung Galaxy S10? Do you find yourself constantly running out of juice before the end of the day? Well, fear not, as we have compiled a list of 10 surprising hacks that you can use to double your Samsung Galaxy S10 battery life. It's easier than you think!

## 1. Turn off unused features

The Samsung Galaxy S10 comes with a host of features, but we don't always need or use all of them. Turning off unused features can greatly improve battery life. This includes features like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, and even the GPS.

## 2. Lower screen brightness

One of the biggest drains on your battery is the screen. Therefore, lowering your screen brightness can have a huge impact on your battery life. Turning on the auto-brightness feature is also recommended as it adjusts the brightness according to the lighting conditions.

## 3. Enable power-saving mode

The Samsung Galaxy S10 comes with a power-saving mode that helps to extend battery life. This mode conserves power by reducing performance, restricting background data, and limiting animation.

## 4. Uninstall unused apps

Uninstalling apps that you don't use can also improve battery life. Many apps run in the background, consuming power even when you're not using them. Getting rid of them can free up resources and extend your battery life.

## 5. Use a black wallpaper

The Samsung Galaxy S10's display is made up of pixels that emit their own light. Therefore, using a black wallpaper means that fewer pixels are lit up, resulting in less battery consumption.

## 6. Turn off haptic feedback

Haptic feedback or vibrations can use up a lot of power, so turning it off can save you some battery life. You can turn it off by going to settings and selecting "sound and vibration."

## 7. Use battery-saving apps

There are many battery-saving apps that you can download from the app store. These apps help to optimize your device, reduce power consumption, and extend your battery life.

## 8. Disable "Always-on-display"

The "Always-on-display" feature is great for quickly checking the time and notifications, but it also uses a lot of power. Disabling this feature can save you some battery life.

## 9. Use a dark mode

Using a dark mode can also help to save battery life. Dark mode uses less power than the light mode, as fewer pixels are lit up.

## 10. Turn off automatic app updates

Automatic app updates can use up a lot of power, especially if you have several apps that need updating. Turning off automatic app updates means that you can update your apps manually at a time that's convenient for you.

These are just some of the many ways to double your Samsung Galaxy S10 battery life. By implementing these tips, you can enjoy a longer battery life and worry less about running out of juice before the end of the day.

## Make Samsung Galaxy S10 battery last longer
 
Battery life can be improved by the following steps as long as the battery itself is not damaged. If the problem is the battery itself, you have no other option but to replace it altogether. Of that is not the case, here are the steps you can do to make Samsung Galaxy S10 battery last longer.
 
Battery Usage: In most of the cases, the reason why the battery is draining so fast are the apps. There is an inbuilt tool you can use to check what apps are using how much battery and act accordingly. The apps you frequently use, especially the social media apps might be the culprits. Also, some apps are notorious for running in the background and draining the battery. So it is always a good idea to check the battery usage.
 

 
To do so;
 
- Open Settings.
 - Tap on Device Care.
 - Select Battery.
 - Tap on Battery Usage.

 
Restart: A simple restart can sometimes fix some common issues, including battery drainage. There may be some minor bugs that may be causing the battery life problems. A restart may be able to fix those bugs and eliminate battery problems. You can restart using the Power menu, or the better way is to press and hold the Volume Down button and the Power button at the same time to force a restart. Force restarting will act like removing the battery and putting it again.
 
It is recommended to reboot your Galaxy S10 once a week. You can schedule a restart from Settings > Device Care > tap on 3-dot menu > Select Auto Restart.
 
Clear Cache: A corrupted system cache can be the issue here. It may be time to clear the system cache partition. It is simple.
 
Follow the following steps;
 
- Turn off your phone.
 - Press and hold the Volume Up button, Bixby button, and Power button.
 - After the green Android logo appears, let go of all the buttons. You will get into recovery.
 - Use Volume buttons to navigate and select Wipe Cache Partition.
 - Press the Power button to select.
 - Highlight Yes using the volume buttons and press the power button to execute.
 - After some time, the cache will be wiped. Reboot the device by selecting Reboot system now.

 
Always-On Display: If you have enabled Always-On Display, that may be the reason for battery drainage. Although Samsung says only 5% of the battery is used by AoD, it could still be the culprit.
 
To disable AoD;
 
- Go to Settings.
 - Select the Lock Screen.
 - Disable Always-On display.

 
There are other factors that can affect battery life. Below is the list of all the probable reasons why the battery on your Samsung Galaxy S10 is draining fast.
 
- Unnecessary features such as Edge Panel, Edge Lightning, Gestures, Palm Swipes.
 - Colorful and bright wallpapers (use night mode or darker wallpaper)
 - Networking features such as GPS, Bluetooth, Mobile Data, WiFi (turn off when not in use)
 - Screen Brightness
 - Not enabling Power Saving Mode (Settings > Device Care > Battery > Power Mode)
 - Not updating system (updates may fix problems causing battery drainage)
