At the Made by Google event in New York City, the company unveiled its new lineup of devices for 2018, including its new flagship Pixel 3 phones, Pixel Slate hybrid tablet, and the Google Home Hub.
 
Here are the biggest announcements from Google:
 
## Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL
 
The biggest announcement at the Google event was, without a doubt, the unveiling of the new Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL phones.
 
If you’ve been following the leaks online, you already know pretty much everything that you’re getting with these new phones, including wireless charging Qi and a wide-angle front-facing camera.
 
These mobile devices have the same internals, such as a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and 4GB of memory.
 
The only real difference is the screen and battery size. The Pixel 3 features a 5.5-inch (2160 x 1080) display and a 2915 mAh battery, while the Pixel 3 XL sports a 6.3-inch (2960 x 1440) display with a gigantic notch and a 3430 mAh battery.
 
The smaller Pixel 3 and the bigger Pixel 3 XL will come with 64GB or 128GB of storage, and they’re expected to be available on October 18. Preorders are available immediately through the Google Store. Pricing starts at $799 for the smaller screen, while the bigger one will cost $899. They’ll be first available on Verizon network, but the company will be selling the phones unlocked as well.
 
## Google Home Hub
 
Google also introduced a new version of its Home speakers, which now includes a touch-enabled display. It’s like a tablet docked to some big speakers. The device has been designed to be the hub to control your smart devices around the house (for example, cameras, thermostats, and lights), and of course, to access all the services that the search engine offers.
 

 
The Google Home Hub will be available in four colors — Chalk, Charcoal, Aqua and Sand –, and you can preorder it now, and it’ll cost $149.

## Pixel Slate
 
Google is betting again on tablets with its new Pixel Slate 2-in-1 tablet, which also runs Chrome OS. Similar to Windows 10 running on a Microsoft Surface device, the operating system switches seamlessly between desktop and table modes, and you can run Android apps available from the Play Store.
 
The tablet also has a keyboard, which is a detachable folio with rounded keys and a trackpad. Again, similar to the Surface Type Cover, but with magnets that allow you to adjust the viewing angles, but it doesn’t offer lapability as the Microsoft devices offer.
 
The Pixel Slate comes in various hardware configurations from a Celeron processor to an Intel 8th generation Core i7 on the most expensive model. The pricing starts at $599, while the keyboard will be sold separately for $199, and the pen will cost you another $99.
 
Google Pixel Slate is expected to ship this year, and preorders are not yet available.
 
Alongside these new products, Google also introduces the Pixel Stand, which is just a wireless charger for its new phones and some extra features. In addition, the company announced a new improved Chromecast device with a performance boost of 15 percent bringing support for 1080p videos at 60fps.
