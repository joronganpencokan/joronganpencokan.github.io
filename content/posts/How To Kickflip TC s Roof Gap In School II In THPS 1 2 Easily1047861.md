If you are a big fan of skateboarding, then you must have played the classic skateboard video game, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (THPS). The game has been around for over two decades, and it has a massive following of players who still enjoy it till this day. One of the most exciting and challenging parts of the game is unlocking new areas and completing challenging tricks. One of the most complicated tricks to complete is the Kickflip TC's Roof Gap in School II. In this article, you will learn how to master this trick with an easy tutorial.

Before we dive into the tutorial, let's talk about the importance of the Kickflip TC's Roof Gap in School II trick. The trick is part of the School II level in THPS, and it is the final trick in the game. Completing this trick will unlock a new character, Officer Dick, who is one of the most unique characters in the game. Officer Dick can be used to complete other complex tricks that were previously impossible with the other characters.

Now, let's get started with the tutorial. First, you need to choose a character in THPS who has a high jump and speed. We recommend using Tony Hawk, Rodney Mullen, or Rune Glifberg. These characters have the best stats for completing the Kickflip TC's Roof Gap in School II trick.

Once you have selected your character, head to the School II level in THPS. From there, locate the ramp near the basketball court. The ramp should be on your right-hand side. Make sure that you have enough speed before heading towards the ramp. The speed should be around 40-50 mph.

As you approach the ramp, hold down the X button on PlayStation or A button on Xbox to build up speed. Then, jump off the ramp and press the B button on Xbox or the Circle button on PlayStation to initiate the Kickflip. Make sure you hold down the button for a sufficient amount of time to complete the Kickflip.

Now comes the tricky part. As you perform the Kickflip, you need to aim towards the roof gap on your right-hand side. Make sure you position your character correctly to land smoothly on the other side of the roof gap. Timing and accuracy are essential here.

As you land on the other side of the roof gap, hold down the X button on PlayStation or A button on Xbox to build up speed again. Make sure you have enough speed for the next jump.

Finally, make a right turn towards the fire escape stairs and jump towards the left to complete the final part of the trick. Once you have landed smoothly, you have successfully completed the Kickflip TC's Roof Gap in School II trick.

In conclusion, the Kickflip TC's Roof Gap in School II trick is one of the most challenging tricks to complete in THPS. However, with the right character and sufficient practice, you can unlock a new character and level up your gaming experience. We hope that this tutorial has been helpful and that you have learned a thing or two about mastering this incredible trick. Happy skating!
