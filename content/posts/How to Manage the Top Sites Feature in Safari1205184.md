# Unlock The Top Sites Power in Safari with These Genius Management Tips!

As an avid Safari user, you may be familiar with the Top Sites feature, which displays your most frequently visited sites in a highly visual layout. While this feature can be quite handy, it can also become cluttered and difficult to manage. Don't worry, though, because we're here to help unlock the full power of Top Sites in Safari with these genius tips for managing your favorites!

## Tip #1: Customize Your Top Sites

Did you know you can customize the sites that appear in your Top Sites section? Simply hover your mouse over a site thumbnail and click the Edit button that appears. From here, you can change the website's title or icon, move it to a different spot on your Top Sites page, or remove it altogether.

## Tip #2: Pin Important Sites

If there are certain sites you always want to appear at the top of your Top Sites page, consider "pinning" them. To do this, simply hover over a site thumbnail, click on the pushpin icon that appears, and voila! That site will always stay at the top of your Top Sites list.

## Tip #3: Clear Your History

If you notice that your Top Sites page is becoming cluttered with sites you no longer visit, it may be time to clear your history. To do this, click on the History menu in the menu bar, select Clear History, and choose how far back you want to delete your browsing history. Keep in mind that this will remove all sites from your Top Sites list as well, so be sure to pin any important sites before clearing your history.

## Tip #4: Use Private Browsing Mode

If you want to browse the web without leaving a trace in your browsing history or on your Top Sites page, consider using Private Browsing mode. This will prevent Safari from saving any information about the websites you visit, including in your Top Sites section.

## Tip #5: Organize Your Favorites

If you have a lot of sites in your Favorites bar and Top Sites section, it can be helpful to organize them into folders. To create a new folder, simply drag and drop one site thumbnail on top of another. You can then give the folder a name and add additional sites to it. This will help keep your Top Sites page clean and clutter-free.

In conclusion, Top Sites in Safari is a powerful tool for quickly accessing your favorite websites. By customizing, pinning, clearing your history, using private browsing mode, and organizing your favorites, you can make the most of this feature and stay on top of your browsing game. Give these tips a try and see how much more efficient your web browsing experience can be!
