One of the most annoying things in computing is having files that cannot be used by applications on your computer. If this happens to you, then you know how frustrating it can be.
 
This is apparently the case with the new HEIF file format. Newer iPhones and iPads currently take pictures in HEIF (High-Efficiency Image Format) and save images with an HEIC extension. This format, with all its advantages, isn’t native to Windows, but you can quite easily convert HEIC files to JPG using Windows’ standard tools, like Photos and Paint (as well as myriad third-party apps).
 
With its ability to occupy very little storage space, it seems like an extension for the long run. If you hit a brick wall viewing HEIC files on Windows, try some of these ways to convert HEIC to JPG.
