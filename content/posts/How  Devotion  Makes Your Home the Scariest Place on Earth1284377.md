Title: You'll Never Guess How This One Habit Turns Your Home Into a Terrifying Nightmare - Experts Are Shocked!

Subheading: The Surprising Consequences of Neglecting Your Home's Maintenance

Have you ever walked into someone's home and felt like you were in a horror movie set? The ambiance was creepy, the walls were peeling off, and there was an unusual musty smell that lingered in the air. Well, what you probably didn't know is that this terrifying nightmare could easily become a reality in your home if you don't take maintenance seriously.

Experts agree that neglecting your home's maintenance is a recipe for disaster, and the consequences can be nerve-racking. From causing severe damage to your property to putting your health and safety at risk, not taking care of your home can have dire consequences.

Here are some of the frightening consequences of neglecting your home's maintenance.

1. Pest Infestation

A cluttered and unkempt home is a perfect breeding ground for pests like cockroaches, rodents, and termites. These unwanted guests are known for carrying harmful bacteria and viruses that can cause diseases. And the worst part is, once an infestation starts, it can be challenging to get rid of them. You'll need to spend a fortune on pest control, and worse still, you'll have to deal with unpleasant smells and the sight of dead insects.

2. Structural Damage

Ignoring repairs for your home's foundation, roof, or walls can lead to severe damage. The structural integrity of your home can be compromised, resulting in cracks, leaks, and mold growth. Mold growth is a health hazard and can trigger allergies, asthma, and respiratory issues. The longer you wait to fix these issues, the more expensive and complex the repairs become.

3. Emergency Situations

A lack of maintenance can lead to emergency situations, such as fire outbreaks and flooding. Electrical faults, gas leaks, and burst pipes are some of the common causes of emergencies in homes. These incidents can cause significant damage to your property or even endanger your life.

4. Decreased Property Value

If you're planning to sell your home soon, neglecting maintenance is a big no-no. Prospective buyers will shy away from a property that looks worn out, outdated, and unappealing. Neglecting maintenance can decrease your property's value, which could result in a lower selling price and longer time on the market.

Conclusion

It's easy to overlook home maintenance when you're busy with work and family. However, neglecting your home can have serious implications that are not worth risking. By regularly maintaining your home, you'll avoid costly repairs, prevent pest infestations, and ensure the safety and comfort of your family. Don't let your home turn into a nightmare. Take maintenance seriously, and you'll eventually reap the rewards of a well-maintained property.

Devotion is an atmospheric, tense psychological thriller that's also one of the only games, if not the only game, ever effectively banned for political content.

 
### 
Key Takeaways
 
- Devotion is a creepy first-person experience that depends on mood and atmosphere for its scares. The game was controversial in China in 2019, but its actual content isn't particularly inflammatory.Set in 1980s Taipei, this is an interesting view into a place and time that video games rarely ever touch.

 

That description makes it sound like it'd be about politics, and that's what I was expecting when I bought Devotion. What I got instead was a portrait of the slow psychological decay of a small family, as told through a series of interactive nightmares.

 

It turns out that the problem with Devotion amounted to a single misplaced art asset, but that was enough to get Devotion pulled from the international market for over two years.

 

Now, Devotion has returned on the last digital storefront that's available to it: self-publishing via developer Red Candle Games' website. For under $20, you can download a DRM-free copy of a cool indie horror game that's also, quite by accident, one of the most controversial games of the 2010s.

 
##   A Ghost Story, But Youâ€™re the Ghost  
 

It's the late 1980s in Taipei, Taiwan. One evening, Du Feng Yu is watching TV in his apartment before dinner. He suddenly passes out, and when he wakes up, he's alone in an apartment that looks like it's been abandoned for years.

 

When Feng Yu tries to leave, the only working door in the exterior hallway leads him right back to his apartment. It's still empty, but now it's two years earlier, and everything is subtly wrong.

 

Devotion is a first-person adventure game in the spirit of "walking simulators" like Gone Home or What Remains of Edith Finch. Your first job, as Feng Yu, is to try and figure out what's going on; your second is to determine why. That involves exploration, searching for clues, and solving the occasional puzzle. There's no combat in Devotion, and I've yet to find a way to die, but every step forward comes with another plot twist.

 

What keeps the game moving is that it's got a very narrow focus. The further you get into Devotion, the more often you end up right back in Feng Yu's apartment, which is a little more twisted every time you visit.

 

While the game isn't afraid to go for the cheap thrills, like ghosts jumping out at you or creepy dolls, its biggest triumph as a horror game is how it manages to make this unexciting little nicotine-colored flat into a vortex of dread. Each time I visited Feng Yu's apartment, Devotion found a brand new way to get under my skin.

 
##   The Million-Pound Banhammer  
 

Devotion was made by Red Candle Games, an independent studio headquartered in Taipei. Like its previous title, Detention, Red Candle specifically set Devotion in Taiwan, drawing on local religion and folklore to sketch out the story. As it turned out, that was part of the problem.

 

After its original launch in February 2019, Devotion quickly became popular among players and streamers in China. That lasted for about a day, until one of them noticed a poster on a wall in the game that mocked Chinese President Xi Jinping.

 

Red Candle Games claimed that the poster was a placeholder asset left in by mistake, but a controversy had already begun. By the time the dust settled, Red Candle Games had lost its original publisher, and censors were scrubbing all mention of Devotion from Chinese social media.

 

I'd heard Devotion was good, but missed the two-day window to buy it back in 2019. Now, playing it via a direct download from Red Candle Games, I'm glad I got this second chance.

 

On its own merits, it's a well-made horror game, set in a part of the world that rarely gets any attention from the video game industry, and doesn't rely on gratuitous gore to freak you out.

 

In a perfect world, Devotion would've put Red Candle Games on the map, and it would be working on its next title by now. Instead, it's a historical curiosity, and I can only hope that it does well as a self-published title.
