# Discover the Shocking Truth Behind Making the Ultimate Chemfuel in Rimworld - Unleash Your Inner Mad Scientist!

Have you ever wondered what the ultimate chemfuel in Rimworld is? Are you curious about how to create this powerful resource to fuel your colonists' needs? Look no further, as we delve into the world of Rimworld's chemfuel production, uncovering the frightening secrets and challenges you may face along the way.

First, let's talk about what chemfuel is and why it is so essential in Rimworld. Chemfuel is a type of fuel that can power generators, transport vehicles, and fire-based weapons, making it an essential resource for any colony that wants to survive in the unforgiving world of Rimworld. Without it, you and your colonists will be left in the dark, vulnerable to the dangers that surround you at every turn.

So, how do you create this crucial resource? The answer may surprise you â€“ it's through the power of science! Specifically, through the use of the chemical refinery, which allows you to convert a variety of organic materials into chemfuel.

To make chemfuel, you will need to gather organic materials such as wood, animal corpses, or grass. These materials are then transported to the chemical refinery, where they are processed into the chemfuel. However, not all organic materials are created equal, and some are more efficient than others. For example, wood produces the most chemfuel per unit of space, while animal corpses produce more chemfuel than grass and other plant materials.

But creating chemfuel is not as easy as it sounds; it requires a considerable amount of energy and resources. You will need to build and power the chemical refinery machine, which requires a significant amount of electricity to run. You will also need to haul large amounts of organic material to and from the refinery to produce enough fuel for your colony's needs.

Additionally, the process of refining organic material into chemfuel releases toxic fumes, which can be dangerous to your colonists if they are not adequately protected. It is essential to keep the chemfuel refinery in a well-ventilated area and ensure that your colonists wear protective gear when handling the refined fuel.

Creating the ultimate chemfuel in Rimworld is a challenging task, but the rewards are immense. With enough chemfuel, you can power your colony's needs, from generators to transportation vehicles and even deadly weaponry. Plus, mastering the art of chemfuel production will make you the ultimate mad scientist in the Rimworld universe.

So, what are you waiting for? Unleash your inner mad scientist and start producing the ultimate chemfuel in Rimworld today! But remember, with great power comes great responsibility, so handle your new found power with care.

## How to Make Chemfuel in RimWorld
 

 
Chemfuel in RimWorld is a craftable & renewable fuel source. That means you can make it which is pretty easy to do. To make Chemfuel, all you need to do is burn Wood or any other Organic Matter in a Biofuel Refinery. For 70 Wood you will burn, you will get 35 Chemfuel. This is a pretty average way of getting Chemfuel. In this conversion, you lose about half of your resources & about 4 Silver worth of money.
 
The better way of getting Chemfuel is by taming up Boomalopes or by having an Infinite Chemreactor. Boomalopes are herbivores with a high hunger rate and are found in Temperate Forests, Temperate Swamps, Tropical Rainforests, Tropical Swamps, Arid Shrublands, & Deserts. If set up correctly, you can get 11 Chemfuel per day from one Boomalope. Get a few of them and you will have an infinite supply of Chemfuel. Infinite Chemreactor is also a good way to get Chemfuel but it requires you to power it with 300W of Energy. Plus it is a Quest Reward and not easily available as compared to the Boomalopes. You can breed a couple of Boomalopes to get more Boomalopes.
