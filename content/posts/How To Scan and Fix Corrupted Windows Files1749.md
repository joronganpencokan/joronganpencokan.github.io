Title: Unlock the Secret to a Faster, Error-Free PC – Learn How to Scan and Fix Corrupted Windows Files Today!

Are you dealing with a sluggish and error-prone computer? Do you see random pop-ups, crashes, and blue screen errors? If yes, you might have a problem with corrupted Windows files.

Over time, Windows files can get damaged or corrupted due to malware, hardware failure, power outage, or software conflicts. These corrupt files can cause a wide range of issues, from slow performance and freezing programs to BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) errors and system crashes.

Fortunately, you don't have to spend a fortune on a new PC or rely on a tech expert to fix the problem. You can use a built-in Windows tool called System File Checker (SFC) to scan and repair corrupted files quickly and easily.

In this article, we'll show you how to use SFC to troubleshoot and fix common Windows file problems.

What is System File Checker (SFC)?

SFC is a Windows utility that checks for corrupted or missing system files and replaces them with healthy versions. It's designed to maintain the stability and integrity of your operating system by identifying and repairing damaged files.

How to Use System File Checker (SFC)

Using SFC is a straightforward process. Here's how you can scan and repair corrupted Windows files using SFC:

Step 1: Open an elevated Command Prompt

Click the Start button and type "cmd" in the search box. Right-click on the Command Prompt option and select "Run as Administrator."

Step 2: Run SFC scan

In the Command Prompt window, type "sfc /scannow" without quotes and hit Enter. This will initiate the SFC scan and check for corrupt Windows files.

Step 3: Wait for the scan to complete

The SFC scan may take a few minutes to complete, depending on the size and complexity of your system files. Make sure not to interrupt the scan or shut down your computer during this process.

Step 4: Review the scan results

After the scan completes, SFC will display a report detailing any corrupted or missing files it found and repaired. If SFC found any errors, it will attempt to replace the damaged files with healthy ones. If it can't fix the problem, it will suggest alternate solutions.

Step 5: Restart your computer

After the repair process is complete, restart your computer and check if the Windows file issue is resolved. If the problem persists, you might need to try other troubleshooting methods.

In Summary

System File Checker (SFC) is a useful tool for maintaining and repairing corrupted Windows files. By using SFC, you can identify and fix common issues that cause slow performance, freezing, and errors on your PC. If you face any technical difficulties or still need help, seek out an expert in the field and have them fix it for you.

## Steps To Scan and Fix Corrupted Windows Files


Hence, we have shared a few simple methods to scan and fix corrupted windows files in this detailed guide. Doing this will rule out all errors and problems due to corrupted or missing system files. Let’s get started.
1. First, press the windows button and then type Powershell, and now it will display the Windows Powershell option, right-click on it and select Run as Administrator. 

2. Now, in PowerShell, enter the sfc /scannow command to scan all the corrupted files.
3. Now, you need to fix the files, and for that, you need to enter the below command in Powershell. Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

4. Now, windows will start fixing the files, and you should be patient in this process as it will take quite a time to complete.
5. Now, you need the actual ISO file to get the file recovered. For that, you need to download the Windows ISO file of your particular version.
6. When the file is downloaded, right-click on it and choose the option mount.
7. Now come back to the PowerShell window and enter the below command. Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:wim:X:\sources\install.wim:1
Note: Replace the letter “X” with the actual drive letter of your Windows installation media.

8. Now execute the below command in PowerShell sfc /scannow

That’s it! Now you will see the message that the windows file has been recovered successfully.

 
### Fix Windows Corrupted files if the SFC command failed to fix


Sometimes, the SFC command fails to fix the corrupt Windows files. It will show you a message like “Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but could not fix some of them”. So, if the SFC command fails to run or can’t replace the corrupted files, then the DISM command sometimes fix the underlying Windows system.
However, you shouldn’t normally have to run the DSIM command. Use it only if the SFC command fails to fix the underlying problems.
1. First of all, open Command Prompt with administrative rights. Now you need to enter the following commands.
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
2. The process can take between 10-15 minutes to complete. The process stuck at several percent, but there’s nothing to worry about.

After the scan process completes, it will show you the results of the DISM command. Restart your Windows Computer and then run the SFC command again. This time, your SFC command will run properly and fix corrupted files.

 
### Repairing system files when windows failed to boot


1. You need to have the Windows installation DVD; you can borrow one from a friend or use a Recovery drive created on any computer. Insert the Windows Installation DVD and boot it on your computer.
2. Once booted, you will see the windows installation option. One the first step, you will be asked to select the language and time format. Click on ‘Next‘ to continue.

3. Now, on the next page, you need to click on Repair Your Computer.

4. Now, you will be asked how you want to continue to repair your computer. Here you need to select the option ‘Troubleshoot‘

5. Now in the next step, you will be given two options; you need to select Advanced Option.

6. Now, under “Advanced Options,” select “Command Prompt“

7. Now, in the command prompt, you need to use the ‘dir’ command. The command will help you find your Windows partition’s drive letter. Like in the screenshot below. D:\ has the actual windows partition.

8. You need to run the ‘SFC’ command to repair the windows installation. It will fix all the corrupted files. , enter the command
sfc /scannow /offbootdir=D:\ /offwindir=D:\windows

Note: you can replace D:\ with your actual drive letter in the above command
Now, wait until the scan completes. Once completed, reboot the system and enjoy. This will fix the Windows corrupted files issue.

 
### System Restore and Reset


If the two methods fail to work, you must run the system restore tool to fix the issue. The system restore tool was included in Windows 10 and 8.1.
The tool restores your operating system files to a previous state, a time when the files were not corrupt. However, remember the name of the essential apps or backup your files onto the external hard drive or Pendrive because system restore will delete some of the apps installed on your computer.
1. First, in the Windows search bar, enter “System Restore” and then open the Create a Restore Point.

2. You need to click on the configure button.

3. You need to enable the “Turn on system protection“, make the Max Usage level 5-10%, and press Apply.
