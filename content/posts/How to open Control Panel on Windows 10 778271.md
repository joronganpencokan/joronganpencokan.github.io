Although the Settings app is the experience that replaces Control Panel in Windows 10, you still need to get to the old Control Panel as not every setting has been migrated to the new experience.
 
The only issue is that on the effort to get you used to use the new Settings app, Windows 10 has been removing ways to open Control Panel. However, it’s still possible to access this experience in a number of ways when you need to configure a feature on the OS that isn’t available in the Settings app.
 
In this guide, you’ll learn a number of ways to open the old Control Panel experience on Windows 10.
 
## How to open Control Panel
 
While there are still available a number of ways to open the old experience to change the settings on Windows 10, here a list with the most common steps to get to Control Panel.
 
### Using the Start menu
