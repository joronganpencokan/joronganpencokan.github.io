# Unlock the Ultimate Guide to Naming Your Valheim Pets and Changing Their Names Like a Pro!

Valheim, the Viking survival game, has captured the hearts of many gamers worldwide. From exploring new worlds to fighting off mythical beasts and creatures, the game has everything you need to get your adventure fix. A notable feature in Valheim is the ability to tame and name your pets, adding a fun and personalized touch to your gameplay. However, choosing the perfect name for your furry friend can be challenging. In this article, we'll provide you with some tips and tricks to help you choose the perfect name for your Valheim pet and change it like a pro. 

## Naming your Valheim pet

Naming your pet is a crucial aspect of your gameplay. Having a name for your pet makes your gameplay more personalized, making your pet feel like a real companion. Here are some tips to keep in mind when naming your pet:

### 1. Keep it short and sweet

When naming your pet, it's essential to keep the name short and easy to pronounce. This makes it easier for you to remember it and command your pet. It also reduces the chances of misspelling the name during gameplay.

### 2. Choose a name that suits your pet's personality

Consider your pet's personality when choosing their name. For example, if you have a fierce wolf, you could name it "Fenrir" after the Norse wolf that killed Odin. Alternatively, you could name your pet after your favorite Viking deity.

### 3. Incorporate the Norse culture

Valheim is a Viking-inspired game, making it a perfect opportunity to incorporate Norse mythology into your gameplay. Consider choosing a name that aligns with Norse culture or references a particular Viking legend or myth. For example, you could name your pet "Loki" after the mischievous Norse god.

## Changing your pet's name

Once you've named your pet, there might come a time where you want to change their name for personal reasons, or maybe you've found a better name. Fortunately, changing your pet's name is easy. Here's how you can change your pet's name like a pro.

### 1. Have the pet's command rod ready

To change your pet's name, you'll need to use the command rod. If you don't have the command rod, craft one at the stone cutter using ten wood and one core wood. Once you have the command rod, equip it, and aim at your pet.

### 2. Use the 'Rename' option

With the command rod equipped, interact with your pet by selecting the 'Interact' option. From the interaction menu, select the 'Rename' option, and a textbox will appear where you can type the new name of your pet. Once you've typed out the new name, hit enter, and your pet's name will be changed.

### 3. Choose wisely

Changing your pet's name is simple, but it's a decision that you should consider carefully. Ensure you've chosen a name that you'll be satisfied with, and it matches your pet's personality.

In conclusion, naming your pet adds a personalized and fun touch to your Valheim gameplay, making it essential to choose the perfect name. Remember to keep it simple, factor in your pet's personality, and incorporate the Norse culture. If you want to change your pet's name going forward, it's easy to do so. Remember to have the command rod ready, use the 'Rename' option, and choose a name wisely. With our tips and tricks, you're now equipped to choose and change your Valheim pet's name like a pro. Happy gaming!
