Unleash INSANE Combos with Guilty Gear Strive's Roman Cancel - Master the Technique NOW with this Must-Read Guide on Gamer Tweak!

Introduction:
Guilty Gear Strive, the latest addition to the popular fighting game franchise, has been a huge success since its release in early June 2021. Among the many exciting features of the game, one that stands out is the Roman Cancel technique. The Roman Cancel is a powerful move that can significantly enhance your combo game, and once you master it, you can take your gameplay to the next level. In this article, we'll explore what the Roman Cancel is and how you can use it to unleash insane combos.

Body:
The Roman Cancel is a technique that lets you cancel a move mid-animation and perform another move immediately after. This means that you can interrupt a move that would normally leave you vulnerable and follow up with a more potent attack or a combo before your opponent can react. The Roman Cancel is especially useful in Guilty Gear Strive because it allows you to perform long, intricate combos that deal massive damage.

To perform a Roman Cancel, you need to input a specific command during the animation of your current move. In Guilty Gear Strive, there are three types of Roman Cancels - Red, Yellow and Purple - each with its unique properties.

The Red Roman Cancel is the most basic and easy to execute. It consumes 50% of your Tension gauge, and when activated, it puts your opponent in a slowed-down state, giving you enough time to link more attacks and combine them into longer combos.

The Yellow Roman Cancel is more advanced and requires precise timing. It halts your move’s animation without slowing down your opponent, allowing you to create more pressure and catch them off guard.

The Purple Roman Cancel is the most advanced and difficult to perform. It consumes 50% of your Tension and requires precise timing and knowledge of your opponent's moves. It freezes your opponents briefly but puts you in a vulnerable position, so it's crucial to use it sparingly and only when you're confident of your timing.

To become a master of Roman Cancels and unleash insane combos, you need to practice and master the timing and spacing of each type of cancel. You should start with Red Cancel to get used to the concept and build up to Yellow and Purple.

With practice, you can also learn to perform Fake Roman Cancels, which are feints that can bait your opponent to make mistakes and open up opportunities for your combos.

Conclusion:
The Roman Cancel is one of the most powerful and exciting techniques in Guilty Gear Strive. Mastering it is essential if you want to take your gameplay to the next level and unleash insane combos on your opponents. With this guide, we hope you have a better understanding of what the Roman Cancel is and how you can use it to become a master of the game. So, get out there and start practicing!

Guilty Gear Strive has a mechanism called Roman Cancel, which, when used properly can be your greatest move. However, it is all about where, when, and how to use it in the game. So to execute a perfect RC in GGS, keep reading this guide.
 
## How To Roman Cancel (RC) In Guilty Gear Strive?
 

 
To Roman Cancel in Guilty Gear Strive, press 3 buttons simultaneously with none of them being the dust button. This will literally cancel your combo if you are in it midway and bring your character back into a neutral position. RC will help you start a new combo from scratch that will match the opponent’s move.
 
Remember, using it at the wrong time may just make you stand there in a match and take a higher amount of damage, so timing and speed are the keys to executing a perfect RC that would work in your favor.
 
### Types of RC in GGS
 
These are the types of RC that the players have at their disposal in GGS:
 
- Red RC– Red will cost you 50% of your tension meter and in return will cancel out your character’s animation into an optimal setup, combo extension, or a stray hit depending on what move set are you currently in.
 - Yellow RC– For 50% of your tension meter, you can replace your dead angle attack by generating a shockwave while blocking and attack and knocking back your enemy, slowing him down a little.
 - Purple RC– Again costing 50% of your tension meter, it will slow down your enemy. This roman cancel will occur right during the start of an attack or during the end of it provided the opponent is not in a hitstun or a blockstun.
 - Blue RC– In exchange for 50% of the tension meter, this RC can be applied when your character is in a neutral position and not attacking.

 
So that is all for our guide on how to Roman Cancel in Guilty Gear Strive. If you would like to know how to invite friends to the game, we have a guide on that too for you to check out.
