# Unlock The Secrets To Never Losing Your Snapchat Streaks Again With This One Simple List Hack!

Snapchat is one of the most popular social media platforms out there. It has managed to capture the attention of millions of users worldwide, thanks to its unique features, which include Snapchat streaks. These streaks are a way to show off how close you are to your friends by counting the number of consecutive days you have exchanged snaps with each other.

For many Snapchat users, maintaining streaks is a matter of pride. They put in a lot of effort to keep these streaks going, but sometimes, despite their best efforts, they end up losing them. Losing a streak can be an upsetting experience, but the good news is that you can prevent it from happening by using a simple list hack.

## What is the list hack?

The list hack is a simple way to keep track of all your Snapchat streaks so that you never forget to send a snap to any of your friends. With this hack, you can avoid the frustration and disappointment of losing a streak and instead focus on enjoying the experience of Snapchatting with your friends.

## How to use the list hack?

To use the list hack, create a list of all the friends you have ongoing streaks with. You can do this by either writing it down on a piece of paper or use a note-taking app. Make sure to update the list regularly and add new friends as you begin new streaks.

Once you have the list, use it as a reminder to snap your friends every day. You can use the list to keep track of the last time you snapped with a particular friend, as well as the number of days you have been exchanging snaps with them. This will help you avoid forgetting to send a snap to any of your friends and losing a streak as a result.

## Other tips to avoid losing streaks

Apart from using the list hack, there are other things you can do to avoid losing your Snapchat streaks. Here are some tips to help you maintain your streaks:

- Set a reminder on your phone to remind you to snap your friends every day.
- Make sure you sent a snap to your friend before midnight to avoid losing the streak.
- Consider having a backup plan in case you are unable to access Snapchat on a particular day. For example, you can ask your friend to send you a snap if you are unable to snap them.
- Communicate with your friends if you are going to be travelling or unable to access Snapchat for a particular day.

Snapchat streaks are an excellent way to show off your connections with your friends. With the list hack and these tips, you can ensure that you never lose your streaks again. So, keep snapping, keep your streaks going, and most importantly, have fun!

So, what are we waiting for? Let’s get started!
 
### Make a list on Snapchat for Streaks
 
Making a list on Snapchat for streaks is not as difficult as you might think. All you have to know is the name of the user that you’d like to maintain the streaks with. Once you have these users in mind, follow the given steps to make a list:
 
1. Swipe down the camera icon and open the “My Friends” list.
 
2. Tap on the “My Friends” icon. An entire list of your friends on Snapchat will now be displayed.
 
3. When you tap on the name of a user, a pop-up will appear.
 
4. Look for the Edit icon and tap on it then select “Edit Name”. You can now edit the name of this user.
 
5. There are several ways in which you can rename users for clubbing them together. The best way to do this is by using an emoji before their names.
 
6. Repeat the same steps with the rest of the users you would like to maintain the streak. Once you have renamed about 8+ users, scroll at the bottom of your list. You will see that all these users are clubbed together.
 
7. You can also use a character to rename these users. However, this is not very effective because you might get confused about the actual names. The good thing about using a character is that all of these will appear at the top of the list instead of at the bottom, as in the case of emojis.
 
Once you are done renaming, you have completed the major part of the process. The advantage of renaming Snapchat users is that these names will remain on the application itself, and it won’t have any effect on your contact list at all.

### How to send Snaps to these users for Streaks?
 
Now that you have renamed all these contacts, let us take a look at how you can regularly send your snaps to them to maintain streaks.
 
1. Record your snap as usual. This can be a photo or a video.
 
2. Once you’re done editing it, tap on the “Send” icon at the bottom. You will now be shown a list of your friends on Snapchat. If you had used emojis to rename your friends, scroll down to the bottom of the list. You will find all the previously renamed users here.
 
3. Now select individual users and send them your snap.
 
Wasn’t that easy?
 
Can you use the Best Friends feature to send Snaps?
 
The best friends feature is for those users with whom you interact the most. Yes, it can be used to send snaps to maintain streaks, but it will only work with eight users at a time. In order to maintain a high streak score with only eight users, you can utilize this feature as well. But in case the number of users is more than 8, using the Best Friends feature would be futile.
 
Can you use a Select All option to send snaps?
 
If you have been using Snapchat from the beginning, you must have seen and/or used the “Select all” option. However, this option has been discontinued and is not available in recent updates. Therefore, you have to take the longer route of selecting users individually when it comes to sending snaps.
 
Can you use third-party applications to send snaps?
 
Using third-party applications to reduce the burden of selecting users individually is too much of a risk to take. This is because of the following reasons:
 
- Third-party applications are notoriously known for stealing users’ information.
 - They do not take permissions; instead have hidden regulations. You might end up leaking your information to third-party authorities without being aware of it.
 - Apps like Snapchat have also banned users when they found out about their possible connections with third-party usage. Third-party apps may send additional advertisements along with your snaps, which are distasteful and unsolicited.

 
Therefore, using third-party applications is not a secure option to consider. To make a list on Snapchat for streaks and sending your snaps to users individually, can be time-consuming, yet seems to be the safest method to maintain your streaks.
 
Maintaining streaks with your close friends on Snapchat is one of the best ways in which the application invites user engagement. From the user’s point of view, it helps make regular Snapchatting enjoyable. Making a good list not only saves time but also the effort of selecting users from a lengthy friend list manually. This way, you can focus on sending snaps instead of worrying about selecting the right users to send those to.

Q1. How many Snaps do you need for a Streak?
 
The number of snaps that you need for a streak doesn’t matter. What matters is that you should be sending them regularly, at least once every 24 hours.
 
Q2. What is the longest Snapchat Streak in history?
 
According to records, the longest streak in the history of Snapchat is 1430 days.
 
Q3. Can you make streaks with a group on Snapchat?
 
Unfortunately, making streaks with a group is not permitted on Snapchat. In case you would like to maintain a streak, you would have to send the snaps individually to each user. You can rename them in such a way that they appear together in your contact list. This can be done by beginning the name with an emoji or a particular character.
