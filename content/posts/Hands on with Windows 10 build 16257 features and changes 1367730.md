However, this one has truly impressed me.

Utilizing Acrylic materials, this feature brings some beautiful visual enhancements across the operating system. This design element creates a beautiful, modern, and consistent experience that's sure to impress users.

2. Action Center

The Action Center now features a much cleaner design that's easy to read and navigate. The focus is on more natural ease of use and customization. For example, users can now hover over notifications to see more details, improving overall usability.

3. Edge Browser

Microsoft is claiming that Edge Browser in Windows 10 Build 16257 is its fastest yet. It also brings the ability to pin a website page to the taskbar so that it behaves like a standalone application, increasing ease of use. 

Not only that, but Edge is now the default PDF reader. So, every PDF you open will automatically open in the Edge Browser, getting rid of the need to install additional apps.

4. Emoji

If you're a fan of emoji, you'll love the new version of Windows 10. Build 16257 offers a much-expanded list of emojis and includes a new emoji picker that opens by pressing Windows + “ .”

One of the most significant changes to Cortana is a strong focus on making the digital assistant more useful in every area, from productivity to gaming or setting alarms. Cortana also now integrates with your calendar more efficiently, making it possible to create events completely with the use of voice commands.

6. Touch Keyboard

The touch keyboard in Windows 10 Build 16257 now allows you to use swipe gestures to type, meaning you can now slide your finger from one letter to another to spell out words, rather than tapping each letter individually that could be a game-changer for those main on a tablet.
