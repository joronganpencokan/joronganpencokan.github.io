Killing an enemy will offer you anywhere from 150 – 250 points but if you really want to make those points quickly simply focus on breaking enemy control over rings or claim them for your team which will grant you 300 points just to staying alive.
 
But if you are good enough and you can eliminate an opponent who has been guarding a ring and claim it all by yourself you stand to earn almost 750 – 850 points in the space of a minute or two, which will be huge towards leveling up.
 
So make sure that you keep focus and play smart.
