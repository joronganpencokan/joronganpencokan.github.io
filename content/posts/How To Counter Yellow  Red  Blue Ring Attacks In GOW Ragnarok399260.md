Unleash Your Inner Warrior: Defend Against the Most Devastating Ring Attacks in Gow Ragnarok with These Expert Tips!

Gow Ragnarok, one of the most popular mobile games in the world, is known for its challenging battles and exciting gameplay. As a player, you are tasked with building an army, forming alliances, and facing off against formidable enemies in fierce battles. One of the most crucial aspects of Gow Ragnarok is the ring, a powerful weapon that can turn the tide of any battle. However, using the ring effectively is not easy, and even the most experienced players can fall prey to devastating ring attacks. In this article, we'll share expert tips on how to defend against the most devastating ring attacks in Gow Ragnarok and unleash your inner warrior.

Understand the Different Types of Rings

Before we dive into the tips, let's take a moment to understand the different types of rings in Gow Ragnarok. There are four types of rings: Attack Ring, Defense Ring, Magic Ring, and Healing Ring. Each ring has unique properties and can be used in different ways. The Attack Ring is used to inflict damage on enemy troops, while the Defense Ring is used to protect your troops from enemy attacks. The Magic Ring is used to cast spells that can alter the course of battle, while the Healing Ring is used to restore the health of your troops. Understanding the different types of rings and their uses is crucial to effectively defend against ring attacks.

Maintain a Strong Defense

The best defense against ring attacks is a strong defense. Your army should be well-trained and equipped with the latest gear and weapons. Additionally, you should invest in building strong fortifications to protect your troops from enemy attacks. The more fortified your defenses, the harder it will be for your enemies to breach them and launch devastating ring attacks.

Know Your Enemy

Knowing your enemy is critical to defending against ring attacks. Research your opponent's strengths and weaknesses and prepare accordingly. If your opponent is known for using Attack Rings, focus on strengthening your defenses. If your opponent is known for using Magic Rings, focus on building a resistance to magic spells. Understanding your enemy's tactics and weaknesses will give you an edge in defending against ring attacks.

Deploy Anti-Ring Units

Deploying anti-ring units is a great way to defend against ring attacks. Anti-ring units are troops that are specifically designed to counter the different types of rings. For example, Anti-Magic units are resistant to Magic Ring spells, while Anti-Attack units can withstand attacks from Attack Rings. Deploying anti-ring units strategically can help you mitigate the damage from ring attacks and turn the tide of battle in your favor.

Use Ring-Based Strategies

Using ring-based strategies can be a useful way of defending against ring attacks. For example, one effective strategy is to use a combination of Attack Rings and Anti-Attack units. This strategy allows you to deal damage to your opponent's troops while also fending off their ring attacks. Another useful strategy is to use a Defense Ring on your most critical units, such as your commander or key defensive structures. This strategy can help protect your most important assets from devastating ring attacks.

In conclusion, defending against ring attacks is essential to succeeding in Gow Ragnarok. By understanding the different types of rings, maintaining a strong defense, knowing your enemy, deploying anti-ring units, and using ring-based strategies, you can unleash your inner warrior and triumph over even the most devastating ring attacks. With these expert tips, you are well on your way to becoming a formidable force in the world of Gow Ragnarok.

An important part of combat in God Of War Ragnarok is to focus on the colored rings before the enemy attacks. Knowing what to do at that moment (parry, block or evade) will ensure your survival, especially in higher difficulties. Here’s how to counter the enemy rings of different colors in God Of War Ragnarok.
 
## How to Counter Enemy Ring Colors in God Of War Ragnarok
 

 
Table of Contents
 
There are three colors of rings that you will encounter before enemy attacks – yellow, blue, and red. Each of them needs a different reaction from the character you are playing as (Kratos or Atreus).
 
### Yellow Rings
 
This enemy attack can be parried using a shield but if you don’t time it right, it can break your guard. Tap the L1 button at the right time to parry and then proceed with your immediate attacks.
 
The Dauntless shield will help you here because it can deal Stun to the attacker and empower your next Shield Bash. The catch is to time the parry perfectly to improve this effect. So, make sure to tap L1 right before getting hit. You can also try the Rond of Deflection shield to help you with parrying.
 
### Red Rings
 
The enemy attack cannot be blocked or parried. So you must dodge and evade it whenever it’s incoming. Press X while moving to Evade. Double tap X to dodge roll attacks.
 
### Double Blue Rings
 
Some special enemies will show a blue ring attack which means they are unblockable but they can be interrupted. Double tap the L1 button on your controller to counter it to land a shield strike which will interrupt them. After that, continue to land back-to-back attacks on the enemy.
 
Enemies with shields will block all attacks from the front. So you have to find an alternate angle of attack or you can quickly double-tap L1 to perform a shield block break. This will render your enemy vulnerable.
 
That’s everything you can do to counter enemy attacks in GOW Ragnarok. If you liked this guide, check out more guides on how to beat Vanadis Valkyrie, Light Elves, and more God of War Ragnarok Guides on our dedicated section right here on Gamer Tweak.
