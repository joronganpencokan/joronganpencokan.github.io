Title: Revamp Your Browsing Experience: Transform Your Boring Microsoft Edge with Chrome Themes

Microsoft Edge is a popular web browser that serves as the default browser on Windows 10. While Edge has many useful features, including Advanced Web Browsing, Reading View, and Cortana integration, it can still look a bit dull and boring. That’s where Google Chrome themes come in! These custom themes can give your Edge browser a fresh, new look that reflects your style and personality.

Here’s how you can transform your Microsoft Edge with Chrome themes and revamp your browsing experience:

Step 1: Download Microsoft Edge Chromium

If you have not already done so, download the new Microsoft Edge Chromium browser. The new version of Edge uses the open-source Chromium browser engine, the same platform on which Google Chrome is built. This means that Chrome themes can be easily applied to Edge.

Step 2: Go to the Chrome Web Store

Once you have installed the new Edge browser, go to the Chrome Web Store. You can access the Chrome Web Store from the Edge browser by typing “chrome://extensions” in the address bar and hitting Enter.

Step 3: Choose Your Theme

In the Chrome Web Store, you will find a wide range of themes to choose from. Themes are sorted into various categories, including Abstract, Nature, Animals, and more. Simply click on a theme you like and then click the “Add to Chrome” button to install it.

Step 4: Apply Your New Theme

Once you have installed a theme, it will automatically be applied to your Edge browser. If you wish to switch back to the default Edge theme, simply go to “Settings” > “Appearance” and click on “Reset to Default.”

Benefits of Using Chrome Themes in Edge

Customizing your Edge browser with a Chrome theme can make your browsing experience more enjoyable and personalized. Some benefits of using Chrome themes in Edge include:

- Unlimited Choice: The Chrome Web Store has a vast collection of themes to choose from, with new themes being added regularly.

- Easy to Install: Installing a Chrome theme in Edge is a simple process that can be completed in just a few clicks.

- Free of Charge: Most Chrome themes are available for free, so you don’t have to pay anything to give your Edge browser a new look.

Conclusion

If you’re looking to revamp your browsing experience and add a personal touch to your Edge browser, installing a Chrome theme is an excellent way to do so. With a wide range of themes to choose from and easy installation, you can have a fresh, new look for your Edge browser in no time. Try it out and see how it transforms your browsing experience!

Since the new version of Microsoft Edge is based on the Chromium project, the new default browser for Windows 10 shares many similarities to the Chrome browser, including the look and feel, support for extension, and now support for Chrome themes.
 
The ability to use Chrome themes from the Chrome Web Store with the Chromium version of Microsoft Edge has been available for a while, but it required to enable a specific flag from the advanced settings. However, the feature is now slowly being integrated into the browser, and now, you can start using Chrome themes in the Beta or Canary versions of Edge without the need to mess with the advanced flag settings.
 
In this guide, you’ll learn the steps to install and uninstall Chrome themes on the new version of Microsoft Edge.
 
- Install Chrome theme on Microsoft Edge

Once you complete the steps, the theme will apply the new visual changes. However, there is a caveat, because Chrome and Edge have their own new tab page, so the background for the theme won’t appear on Microsoft Edge. Instead, you’ll continue to see the image of the day from Bing.com.
