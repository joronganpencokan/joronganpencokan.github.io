Prior to the Windows 10 version 2004, you had to use the recovery console to rollback your system, which was cumbersome and time-consuming. But with the new Windows 10 release, Microsoft has made it radically simpler and faster to revert the changes.

Windows 10 introduces a new feature that helps you rollback an Insider Build with just a few clicks! Here's how you do it:

**Step 1:** Click on the 'Start' button and click on the 'Settings' icon (gear icon).

**Step 2:** Within the settings menu, click on the 'Update & Security' tab.

**Step 3:** On the Update & Security page, click on the 'Windows Insider Program' tab present on the left pane.

**Step 4:** On the Windows Insider Program page, scroll down till you find 'Release Preview Channel' and click on it.

**Step 5:** Within the Release Preview Channel page, click on the 'Get started' button.

Now, wait for the system to make the necessary configuration changes, and once it's done, you'll see the message 'Welcome to the Release Preview Channel' on the screen. This means that your system is ready to roll back to a stable release.

To rollback to a stable release, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Click on the 'Start' button and click on the 'Settings' icon.

**Step 2:** Within the settings menu, click on the 'Update & Security' tab.

**Step 3:** On the Update & Security page, click on the 'Recovery' tab present on the left pane.

**Step 5:** Windows will prompt you with a message, 'Why are you going back?'. Select an appropriate option and click on the 'Next' button.

**Step 6:** Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the rollback process.

That's it! This is the revolutionary trick that Microsoft has introduced in Windows 10 that simplifies your tech life.

The problem with Dev, Beta, and Release preview channel builds is that they are usually full of bugs. Most often or not, users face issues while using the operating system. What’s worst is that it’s not easy to get out of the Insider program once new builds start shipping.
Microsoft provides you a ten-day time frame to roll back to the previous update. If that period is gone, there’s no easy to uninstall the problematic update. So, if you are also experience issues with Windows 10 updates, you need to find and remove the problematic update. Or else, you can roll back to an older build.
So, in this article, we will share the best method to roll back Windows updates. The process is a little complicated, but it works. So, let’s check out.
