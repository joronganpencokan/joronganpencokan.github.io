While we have already covered the process of linking Battlenet to your Twitch account, you might also want to know how to link Youtube to Battlenet as well. This will help you get some Overwatch League perks, viewership rewards as well as obtain Youtube Drops for Hearthstone. Let’s look at the process to connect the accounts without issues.
 
## How to Link Youtube to Blizzard Battlenet Account (2022)
 
Follow these simple steps to connect your Youtube account to your Blizzard Battlenet account:
 
- Log into your YT account.
 - Click on the Menu button (3 horizontal lines) at the top left of the screen.

 

 
- Find the Settings option > head to Connected Apps.
 - This is where you can connect Youtube with other apps and get the associated rewards easily.
 - Click on Connect next to Battle.net and read the terms and conditions before hitting the blue Connect button.
 - Next, click on Continue.

 
- This will bring up a new window in your browser where you must log in to your existing Battlenet account. If you don’t have one, you can create it from the same window.
 - Once you have followed the instructions and connected your accounts, you can enter the official events or contests to win special prizes.
 - Note that the Battlenet account should be the same one that you wish to get your rewards on.

 
### Not Getting Rewards even after Linking Accounts?
 
There are some common issues that players face even after connecting their accounts.
 
- Make sure that you are logged in while watching an event for a reward. If you are not logged in, the watch time will not be counted and you won’t get the prize.
 - Check for browser plug-ins that are interfering with your Youtube viewing time/rewards and if there are any, disable them and try again.
 - Sometimes, there is a chance that you won’t see a notification for the reward you have earned on Youtube, but they will show up correctly in the game. So, don’t forget to check it there as soon as you have fulfilled the event conditions.
