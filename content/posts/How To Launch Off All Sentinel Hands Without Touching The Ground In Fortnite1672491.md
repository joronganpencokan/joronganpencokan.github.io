Unleash Your Inner Pro: Discover the Secret Trick to Launch Off All Sentinel Hands in Fortnite Without Touching the Ground!

Fortnite is a game of creativity, strategy, and most importantly, skill. With its constantly evolving battle royale gameplay, players are forced to adapt and hone their skills to stay ahead of the competition. One of the most sought-after abilities in Fortnite is the launch off all sentinel hands without touching the ground. It is a move that can give you a considerable advantage over your opponents, allowing you to maneuver through the map and reach inaccessible areas quickly. But how do you perform this move? Let's find out!

First, you will need to find sentinel hands to launch off. These rocks are available in various locations throughout the map, mainly in places that are difficult to reach. Once you locate them, you need to build an open structure around the sentinel hand to give yourself enough room to perform the launch.

Next, you will need to build a ramp leading up to the sentinel hand. Make sure that your structure is strong enough to support your weight and momentum, or you might end up collapsing the structure altogether.

Now, here comes the key to launching off all sentinel hands without touching the ground: Jump, hit the Sentinel hand with your pickaxe, and immediately place your mouse in the direction you want to go. Doing so will launch you off the Sentinel hand and send you flying towards the direction you pointed with your mouse.

It is a move that requires perfect timing and coordination, so don't be surprised if it takes a few attempts before you can master it. However, once you do, you will be able to zip across the map without worrying about the terrain or obstacles that stand in your way.

It is a trick that requires a bit of practice, but it is undoubtedly worth it. Not only will it give you an edge over your opponents, but it is also a lot of fun to perform. So next time you are in a Fortnite battle royale, don't forget to unleash your inner pro and launch off all sentinel hands without touching the ground!
