# Windows 11 users shocked as hidden 'drop shadow' feature found on desktop icons - Learn how to remove it now!

Users of Windows 11 were recently shocked to discover a hidden 'drop shadow' feature present on their desktop icons. The drop shadow is a subtle effect that makes the icons look like they are floating on the desktop. While some users may prefer this effect, there are others who find it distracting and want to remove it.

In this article, we will show you how to remove the drop shadow from your desktop icons in Windows 11.

## What is the 'drop shadow' effect?

The drop shadow effect is a shadow created under an object to give the impression that the object is floating above the surface it is sitting on. In the context of Windows 11, the drop shadow effect is applied to the desktop icons to make them stand out and also to give them a depth effect.

The drop shadow effect is not a new feature, as it has been around in previous versions of Windows. However, in Windows 11, the effect is more pronounced, which is why some users are finding it distracting.

## How to remove the drop shadow effect in Windows 11

If you are one of the users who find the drop shadow effect distracting and want to remove it, here are the steps to do so:

1. Right-click on the desktop and select 'Personalize'.

2. In the Personalization window, select 'Colors' in the left-hand menu.

3. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on 'Advanced display settings'.

4. In the Advanced display settings window, select 'Display adapter properties'.

5. In the Display properties window, click on the 'Troubleshoot' tab.

6. Click on the 'Change settings' button.

7. Move the 'Hardware acceleration' slider to the left, to disable the hardware acceleration.

8. Click on 'Apply' and then 'OK' to save the changes.

After following these steps, the drop shadow effect should be removed from your desktop icons. If you want to enable the drop shadow effect again, simply move the 'Hardware acceleration' slider back to the right to re-enable it.

## Conclusion

The drop shadow effect on desktop icons in Windows 11 is a subtle but divisive feature. Some users find it visually appealing while others find it distracting. If you fall into the latter category, you can follow the steps above to disable the effect, and if you prefer it, you can always enable the feature again.

Both Windows 10 and Windows 11 apply the drop shadow effect on desktop icons. The drop shadow effects are barely visible, mainly if you use a dark background image. However, if you use a lighter wallpaper, you can see the shadows underneath the desktop icon texts.
Drop shadow effect is applied to make the icon text more visible, but the same feature can make text difficult to read in a few displays and lighter wallpapers. You may find it very difficult to read the icon label at times, making the text appear blurry.
