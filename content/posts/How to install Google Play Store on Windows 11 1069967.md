On Windows 11, it’s now possible to install the Google Play Store in the Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) to download and install Android apps on your computer through a workaround that includes many steps. 
 
It was just a matter of time until someone figured it out. You can now install Android apps from the Play Store on Windows 11, but not officially. Instead, a person using the ADeltaX handle on Twitter crafted a procedure to get around the original Windows Subsystem for Android to install the Google Play Store app, giving you access to the entire catalog of Android apps.
 
Although this is a welcome discovery, since the process isn’t supported, it’s unclear how it will affect future updates. In other words, this workaround may only be a temporary fix because it is still not clear what will happen after WSA receives an update through the Microsoft Store. Probably, anyone using this approach will have to redo the entire process. Of course, that’s unless you disable automatic app updates through the Microsoft Store.
 
In this video tutorial, we will demonstrate the process of installing the Google Play Store app on WSA to install Android apps on a Windows 11 machine.
 
## Install Google Play Store on Windows 11
 
The Google Play Store installation process on the Windows Subsystem for Android to run Android apps on Windows 11 requires several steps, including downloading third-party tools, installing WSL, and running various commands using different tools.
 
Before processing, it’s important to uninstall any previous installation of the Windows Subsystem for Android. Otherwise, the instructions below won’t work.
 
### Step one: Create setup folders
 
The process will require four working folders in the root of the drive where Windows 11 is installed.
 
To create the WSA working folders, use these steps:
