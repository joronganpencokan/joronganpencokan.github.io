If you're an avid gamer, you must have heard of Spencer "Hiko" Martin, who is a renowned professional gamer in the Valorant gaming community. Many aspiring gamers admire him for his exceptional skills, strategies, and unmatched gameplay style.

The great news is that Hiko has recently shared his secret sensitivity and crosshair settings in Valorant 2022 to the public, which can help you unleash your inner pro-gamer and elevate your gameplay to the next level.

So, if you want to become a Valorant pro-gamer like Hiko, read on to get the inside scoop on his keybindings and take your game to new heights.

What is Sensitivity, and why is it Critical?

Sensitivity is one of the essential parameters that define how fast or slow your crosshair moves across the screen in response to your mouse movements. In other words, the sensitivity setting determines the ratio of real-world mouse movements and in-game crosshair movements.

Therefore, setting the correct sensitivity in Valorant is crucial for achieving precise aiming, flick shots, and reacting quickly to enemy movements. Moreover, it also helps in maintaining mouse control, which is crucial in fast-paced games like Valorant.

Hiko's Secret Sensitivity Settings

Hiko is known for his exceptional accuracy and precise aim, which is the result of his perfect sensitivity settings. According to Hiko, his current sensitivity settings are:

DPI - 400
In-Game Sensitivity - 0.36
Scoped Sensitivity - 1.00
The above settings are relatively lower than the average sensitivity settings used by most gamers. However, Hiko recommends them to improve your accuracy and aim.

It's essential to note that finding the perfect sensitivity levels is a process of trial and error. Therefore, Hiko suggests experimenting with different settings to find the best sensitivity that works for you.

What is Crosshair, and Why is it Important?

Crosshair is the visual indicator in the center of your screen that helps you aim and shoot at your enemies. Setting the right color, size, and style of crosshair can help you aim more accurately and efficiently.

Hiko's Secret Crosshair Settings

In addition to his sensitivity settings, Hiko has also shared his top-notch crosshair settings. According to Hiko, his crosshair setting is:

Color - Cyan
Outlines - Off
Center dot - Off
Inner line - 1
Outer line - 0
Thickness - 1
Length - 3
Dot size - 1

Hiko recommends this setting because the cyan color stands out in most in-game environments, and the thin lines aid in precision aiming.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Hiko's secret sensitivity and crosshair settings are a game-changer for aspiring Valorant pro-gamers. Setting the right sensitivity helps in achieving precise aim, and the right crosshair settings aids in efficient aiming.

Before you try Hiko's settings, it's crucial to understand that finding the right sensitivity and crosshair settings is subjective and a process of trial and error. Therefore, experiment with various settings to find what works best for you.

With Hiko's secret settings, you're on the path to unleashing your inner pro-gamer and taking your Valorant gameplay to new heights.
