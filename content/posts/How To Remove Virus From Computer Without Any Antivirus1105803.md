The program scans your computer before Windows starts up, making it difficult for viruses to hide or run in the background. This means that the Windows Defender Offline Scan can find and remove viruses that other antivirus software may miss.

## How to Use Windows Defender Offline Scan

Using the Windows Defender Offline Scan is easy. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open the Windows Security app on your Windows 10 computer.
2. Click on "Virus & threat protection."
3. Under "Current threats," click on "Scan options."

5. Click "Scan now" and follow the instructions to complete the scan.

The Windows Defender Offline Scan can take some time, depending on how much data is stored on your computer. Once the scan is complete, Windows Defender will list any harmful or suspicious files that have been detected. You can then choose to remove or quarantine these files.

## Conclusion

Removing viruses from your computer can be a frustrating process, and traditional antivirus software may not always be effective.
