# Unlock the Secret to Opening and Editing Pub Files on Your Mac – Everything you need to know!

If you’ve ever received a Pub file from a colleague or friend, you know how frustrating it can be not to be able to open and edit it on your Mac. Just when you thought you had all the right tools at your fingertips, this file format throws you a curveball. But fear not, as in this article, we’ll give you everything you need to know to unlock the secret to opening and editing Pub files on your Mac.

First things first, let’s start with some basics.

## What are Pub Files?

A Pub file is a file format that is primarily used by the desktop publishing software, Microsoft Publisher. It is a proprietary format that can contain text, images, and other objects that make up a document.

## Why Can’t Mac Users Open Pub Files?

Microsoft Publisher is only available on the Windows operating system. Hence, Mac users cannot open or edit Pub files using normal software. This is because macOS has never supported Microsoft Publisher, which means Mac users have to look for alternative solutions to open such files.

## What Are The Best Solutions To Open and Edit Pub Files on Mac?

There are several ways to open and edit Pub files on your Mac. Here are the most popular:

### Convert Pub Files to Other Formats

One way to open a Pub file on your Mac is to convert it to a more compatible format. For example, you can convert the Pub file to a PDF file format, which can be easily opened and viewed on a Mac. To do this, use online converters such as Pub to PDF.

### Use Microsoft Publisher on a Virtual Machine

Using a virtual machine is another way to open Pub files on your Mac. You need to install a Windows virtual machine, such as Parallels or VirtualBox, which can then run Publisher. You can also use boot camp, which allows you to install Windows on your Mac.

### Use Third-Party Software

Finally, the easiest and most efficient way to open and edit Pub files on your Mac is to use third-party software specifically designed for Mac users. Examples of these apps include:

- iStudio Publisher: A powerful desktop publishing software that is a perfect alternative to Microsoft Publisher.
- Adobe InDesign: Offers a range of features and tools for creating and publishing documents.
- Swift Publisher: A user-friendly desktop publishing app designed for Mac users.

## Conclusion

Opening and editing Pub files on a Mac might seem impossible at first, but with the right tools and solutions, it’s much easier than you think. From converting files to other formats, to using a virtual machine or installing third-party software, there are several ways to open and edit Pub files on your Mac. So, the next time you receive a Pub file, don’t panic, and try the solutions we’ve outlined here to access and edit your file with ease.

If you work with Windows users, or with Windows based systems at your job, you know that one of the most annoying things to deal with is the sharing of your incompatible files. Sure, the majority of your files will work well enough, if you deal primarily in jpegs and text documents. What about .Pub files? What can you do if you want to open them on your Mac and maybe make a few notes?
 
Well, we can use a simple tool to allow you to open them as a PDF. Then once they are readable we can make it up with Preview.

Let’s begin by opening that .pub file as a PDF. We will do that with the help of an online tool called Word to PDF. Don’t let its name fools you, it can convert a lot more than just .doc files.
 
### Converting to a .PDF
 
1. First head to the conversion site, www.pdfonline.com/convert-pdf, by tapping it into your browser.
 

 
2. Once the page loads, choose the file that you need by clicking on “Browse” in the step one box. Then choose an output name in the second box and put your email address into the third box. Then click on “Upload and convert to PDF”. This site will then convert the files and email it to your inbox.
 
3. Retrieve the file and save it to your desktop, or to some place where you will be able to find it easily for the second part of this procedure. Just be sure to open the document once to make sure that the original formatting stays the same.
 
### Marking Up Your PDF
 
Now, we can begin marking up that PDF with Preview. You will only be able to mark it up, and not make any major changes. If you need to send notes to a collaborator, or edits to a freelance professional you have hired, it will be enough. Let’s begin by making your marks:
 
1. Use your normal highlight tool to select your text.
 
2. Choose Tools from the menu at the top.
 
3. In the Tools menu choose Scroll down to “Annotate”. From here you will see a variety of annotation options. You will have a lot of different options. Some of them like strikethrough, underline and highlight you will be familiar with.
 
Or
 
You can add a note – they will give you a new bar on the left side with your notes. You can click on them and type whatever you need to say.
 
See, all of that, with no cost to you at all. Add text will allow you to add words to your project on the document. All you have to do is click on the spot that you want to add text to when the crosshairs appear. Just be aware, while you may be able to alter the size of the box, the text inside it will not change size. You can use this same technique for adding ovals and boxes to the PDF.
 
Now, you can go ahead and mark it up as you see fit. Then just save the file and you can send it wherever you need to.
