From here, you can select the image you want to upload. Evolution also allows you to take a new photo directly from the app if you prefer.

Step 3: Adjust the Size:

After you’ve uploaded your image, Evolution will automatically adjust the size to fit the conversation window. If you want to make the image larger or smaller, simply tap and hold the image and drag it to the desired size.

Step 4: Add a Caption:

Adding a caption to your image is a great way to provide additional context and add a personal touch to your message. To add a caption, simply tap the image and select ‘Add Caption’. Type in your caption, then tap ‘Done’ to save.

Step 5: Send Your Message:

Once you’ve loaded your image, adjusted the size, and added a caption, it’s time to send your message. Simply hit the ‘Send’ button, and your image will be sent to your recipient.

 - Select Allow remote content for [email address] from the menu that has appeared.​​Evolution lets you safelist entire domains as well as hosts from which content is downloaded as well; typically, it is best to stick to adding individual sender's addresses to this list, though.

##   A Nuisance and Necessity  
 

Images in emails can be a major nuisance (especially in spam), and a privacy problem, too (especially in spam). Evolution, wisely, can be configured to not load remote images.

 

There may be one or the other email (certainly not spam) where the image is crucial (uh... the daily Dilbert, for example). Fortunately, you can tell Evolution to load the images in the current message.
