With the premium or free version of Avast, you also get an extension called Avast SafePrice. In this article, we will discuss the Avast SafePrice and what it does. Let’s get started.

 
### What is Avast Safeprice?



Avast SafePrice is just a browser add-on that gets you a better deal. The free browser extension is designed to help you save money as you shop online and travel sites.
Avast SafePrice maintains its own database of trusted e-shops and displays them in the top right corner of your web browser.
So, when you visit an e-commerce website or shopping site, the Avast SafePrice extension checks for all available best offers, deals, and discount coupons.
If it finds any available coupon or offer, it lets you know. So, if you are an online shopper, you should take advantage of the Avast SafePrice Addon.

 
## How to Download & Install Avast SafePrice Browser Extension?


Well, it’s easy to download & install the Avast SafePrice browser extension and addon. Avast SafePrice is available for all major web browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.
To install & use Avast SafePrice, you must install the extension from the browser’s store. You can also download it from the official Avast Website. Here we have shared the example for the Google Chrome browser.
1. Open your Google Chrome web browser and visit the Avast SafePrice Chrome extension page.

2. When the page opens, add the extension to your Chrome web browser.

 
3. Once added, you will find the Avast SafePrice Chrome extension icon on the toolbar.

That’s it! Now, whenever you use a shopping site, the Avast SafePrice extension automatically checks for available coupons and deals.

 
### How to use Avast SafePrice?



It’s pretty easy to use the Avast SafePrice browser extension. Once installed and enabled, the extension runs automatically in the background all the time.
It effectively scans your shopping site to find all available coupons and deals. And if it finds any, Avast SafePrice shows pop-up notifications.
If a coupon code is available for the product you are viewing on the shopping site, you will have the option to Apply a Coupon directly on the notification pop-up.

 
### Is Avast SafePrice a Virus?



Well, if the Avast SafePrice extension suddenly appears in your web browser, even when you haven’t installed it, chances are that you have installed Avast Antivirus on your computer.
Avast SafePrice is also available as a component in Avast Antivirus. So, if you have just installed Avast Antivirus on your device, you will see the Avast SafePrice extension.
However, Avast SafePrice comes bundled with Avast Antivirus only in a few Windows build. For example, the Avast Antivirus installation file for Windows 11 doesn’t include the SafePrice extension.
Hence, if you install Avast Antivirus on Windows 11, you won’t see the Avast SafePrice extension. In that case, you need to install it on your web browser manually.
Now, as far as the question is concerned, ‘Is Avast SafePrice virus?’. No, it’s not. It’s a part of a security suite. Hence it’s not a virus or malware. You can use it without worrying about any privacy or security issue.

 
### Does Avast SafePrice Collect My Data?


This is one of the most important questions you should ask yourself before questioning anything. Avast SafePrice is meant to find the best prices and coupons from the database of trusted e-shops.
To display the offers, it first collects anonymous data about the pages and products you have visited before. Avast, on its official site, does mention that the data Avast SafePrice collects is not connected to your personal data.
