# Revolutionize Your Browsing Experience: Learn How to Install These Must-Have Extensions for Microsoft Edge!

Microsoft Edge has come a long way since it was first launched, and the new Chromium-based version of the browser has made it even better. With its features like improved speed, better privacy and security, and compatibility with Chrome extensions, Microsoft Edge is now a serious contender for the title of the best web browser. And if you want to make the most of your browsing experience, you need to install these must-have extensions for Microsoft Edge.

## LastPass

Password management is a vital part of online security, and LastPass makes it easy to keep all your passwords organized and secure. With a single master password, LastPass can generate strong, unique passwords for all your accounts, remember them, and even fill them in automatically when you browse. LastPass also has a built-in password generator, which can generate strong passwords on demand.

## Grammarly

If you're anything like most people, you probably make some typos and grammar mistakes when you write online. Grammarly is a great extension for Microsoft Edge that can help you catch these errors before you hit "send" or "publish." It uses advanced algorithms to detect over 250 types of grammar, punctuation, and spelling mistakes, and gives you suggestions to improve your writing.

## AdBlock

Ads are one of the biggest annoyances on the web, but AdBlock makes it easy to block them. This extension uses a combination of filters to block ads, pop-ups, and other unwanted content. You can also use AdBlock to whitelist sites you want to support, or disable it on specific sites if needed.

## OneNote Web Clipper

If you're looking for a way to save articles, recipes, or other web content to read later, OneNote Web Clipper is the extension for you. With a single click, you can save any webpage to OneNote, where you can organize and annotate it as needed. OneNote also has a great search function, which makes it easy to find the content you saved.

## Honey

Honey is a great extension for anyone who loves to shop online. It automatically searches for coupon codes and offers from thousands of retailers, and applies them at checkout. With Honey, you can save a lot of money on your online purchases without any effort.

## Pocket

Pocket is another great extension for saving web content to read later, but it has a different approach than OneNote. With Pocket, you can create a reading list of articles, videos, and other content that you want to read or watch later. Pocket also has a great feature that allows you to save an article in a simplified, ad-free format, which makes it easier to read on your phone or tablet.

## The Great Suspender

If you tend to have a lot of tabs open at once, The Great Suspender can help you save memory and improve performance. This extension automatically suspends tabs that you haven't used in a while, freeing up memory and reducing CPU usage. You can also whitelist sites that you don't want to suspend, or disable the extension on specific sites.

## Dark Reader

If you like to browse the web at night, you should definitely try Dark Reader. This extension can apply a dark mode to any website, making it easier on the eyes and more pleasant to use in low-light conditions. You can also adjust the brightness and contrast to your liking, and even whitelist sites that you want to keep in light mode.

In conclusion, these must-have extensions for Microsoft Edge will revolutionize your browsing experience and help you become more productive, secure, and efficient. Whether you're a student, a professional, or a casual user, these extensions have something for everyone. So go ahead and install them today, and enjoy the best browsing experience you've ever had!

The Edge browser is one of the best things about Windows 10. As Microsoft claims this is especially true if you are looking to improve the battery backup of your laptop or notebook.
 
That being said, after a long wait with the Anniversary update, Windows 10 users got the extension support for the Edge browser. Compared to the early insider builds, Microsoft made it easy to install extensions on the Edge browser directly from the Windows Store. As of now, the store has quite a few extensions to play with. Moreover, the extensions are close to Chrome extensions. This makes it easy for the developers to port their extensions to the Edge browser.
 
The following is how to install extensions on the Edge browser in Windows 10.
 
## Install Extensions from Windows Store
 
Installing extensions through the Windows store is the easiest way. To start, open the Edge browser and click on the Menu icon (three horizontal dots) appearing on the top-right corner. Now, select “Extensions” from the list of options.
 

 
The above action will show you all the installed extensions. As you can see, I’ve already installed LastPass. To install a new extension, click on the link “Get Extensions from the Store.”
 
As soon as you click on the link, the Windows Store will be opened automatically and shows you all the available extensions. Just click on the extension you want to install. In my case I’m selecting the OneNote web clipper.
 
Here in this window click on the “Free” button.
 
The above action will automatically download and install the Edge extension. After installing, the Edge browser will show you a prompt. Simply click on the “Turn it On” button to activate the installed extension.
 
That’s all there is to do. You’ve successfully installed the extension.
 
By default, the extensions are hidden from the address bar. If you want to show the extension in the address bar, simply right-click on the extension and select the option “Show next to address bar.”
 
## Install Extensions Manually
 
If you have extensions that are not available in the Windows Store, you can also install them manually. Before you can do that, you need to enable the Extension Developer Options.
 
To do that enter about:flags in the address bar and press the Enter button. In the Settings page select the “Enable extension developer features” checkbox, and close the page.
 
After enabling the extension developer options, download the extension you want to install manually, and extract the extension folder in it onto your desktop. In my case I’ve downloaded the Turn Off the Lights extension for Youtube.
 
Now, click on the Menu icon, select the “Extensions” option, and then click on the “Load extension” button.
 
The above action will open the “Select Folder” window. Here, browse to the location where you’ve extracted the extension folder, select it and then click on the “Select Folder” button.
 
That’s it, you’ve installed and activated the extension.
 
If you want to remove or turn off the extension, simply right-click on the extension and then select the appropriate option.
