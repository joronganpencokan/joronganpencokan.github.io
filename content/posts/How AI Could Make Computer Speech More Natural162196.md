Title: Is This The End of Robotic Voices? How AI is Revolutionizing the Way Computers Speak!

Introduction:
When we think of computer-generated speech, we often imagine robotic, monotonous voices that are easy to distinguish from human voices. However, with the advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), computers are now capable of producing more natural-sounding speech that can almost match the tone, inflection, and style of human speech. This has major implications for the future of voice assistants, virtual assistants, and customer service interactions. In this article, we will explore how AI is transforming the way computers speak.

Body:
1. The Evolution of AI in Speech Synthesis: AI technology has come a long way from the early days of computerized voices. Today, the most advanced speech synthesis systems use sophisticated neural networks and machine learning algorithms to produce audio that is almost identical to human speech. These algorithms can transform text into speech that is expressive and nuanced, with variations in tone and emphasis that can convey subtle shades of meaning.

2. Advancements in Natural Language Processing: Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows computers to understand and interpret human language. This technology is now being integrated with speech synthesis to create more natural and interactive interactions between humans and machines. Advanced NLP systems can recognize the meaning of phrases and sentences, identify the intent behind them, and respond appropriately.

3. The Rise of Voice Assistants and Virtual Assistants: With the availability of more advanced speech synthesis and natural language processing technologies, voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant have come a long way in recent years. These virtual assistants can understand the context of natural language conversation and respond appropriately. They can also recognize different voices, accents, and speech patterns and adjust their responses accordingly.

4. Improving Customer Service: AI-powered voice recognition and speech synthesis systems are transforming customer service interactions. With natural-sounding computer-generated voices, chatbots and virtual agents can better assist customers, handle their inquiries, and resolve their issues. These technologies eliminate the need for customers to wait on hold for long periods and allow businesses to handle a much higher volume of inquiries more efficiently.

Conclusion:
AI continues to revolutionize the way computers speak, creating more natural and expressive voices that can match human speech. This technology has the potential to transform the way we interact with machines, making it easier for people to communicate with technology and receive the help they need more efficiently. We are likely to witness more improvements and innovations in speech synthesis and natural language processing in the years to come, and it will be exciting to see how they will shape the future of human-computer interactions.

Computer-generated speech might soon sound a lot more human. 

 
### 
Key Takeaways
 
- Companies are racing to find ways to make computer-generated speech sound more realistic. NVIDIA recently unveiled tools that can capture the sound of natural speech by letting you train an AI with your own voice. Intonation, emotion, and musicality are the features that computer voices still lack, one expert says.

 

Computer parts maker NVIDIA recently unveiled tools that can capture the sound of natural speech by letting you train an AI with your voice. The software also can deliver one speaker’s words using another person’s voice. It’s part of a burgeoning push to make computer speech more realistic. 

 

"Advanced voice AI technology is allowing users to speak naturally, combining many inquiries into a single sentence and eliminating the need to repeat details from the original query constantly," Michael Zagorsek, the chief operating officer of speech recognition company SoundHound, told Lifewire in an email interview. 

 

"The addition of multiple languages, now available on most voice AI platforms, makes digital voice assistants accessible in more geographies and for more populations," he added. 

 
##   Robospeech Rising  
 

To make artificial speech sound more natural, NVIDIA’s text-to-speech research team developed a RAD-TTS model. The system allows individuals to teach a text-to-speech (TTS) model with their voice, including the pacing, tonality, timbre, and other factors. 

 

The company used its new model to build more conversational-sounding voice narration for its I Am AI video series. 

 

"With this interface, our video producer could record himself reading the video script and then use the AI model to convert his speech into the female narrator’s voice. Using this baseline narration, the producer could then direct the AI like a voice actor—tweaking the synthesized speech to emphasize specific words and modifying the pacing of the narration to better express the video’s tone," NVIDIA wrote on its website. 

 
##   Harder Than It Sounds  
 

Making computer-generated speech sound natural is a tricky problem, experts say. 

 

"You need to record hundreds of hours of someone’s voice to create a computer version of it," Nazim Ragimov, the CEO of the text to speech software company Kukarella, told Lifewire in an email interview. "And the recording must be of high quality, recorded in a professional studio. The more hours of quality speech loaded and processed, the better the result."

 

Intonation, emotion, and musicality are the features that computer voices still lack, Ragimov said.

 
Text-to-speech can be used in gaming, to aid individuals with vocal disabilities, or to help users translate between languages in their own voice.
 

If AI can add these missing links, computer-generated speech will be "indistinguishable from the voices of real actors," he added. "That’s a work in progress. Other voices will be able to compete with radio hosts. Soon you’ll see voices that can sing and read audiobooks."

 

Speech technology is becoming more popular in a wide range of businesses. 

 

"The auto industry has been a recent adopter of voice AI as a way to create safer and more connected driving experiences," Zagorsek said.

 

"Since then, voice assistants have become increasingly ubiquitous as brands are seeking ways to improve customer experiences and meet the demand for easier, safer, more convenient, efficient, and hygienic methods of interacting with their products and services."

 

Typically, voice AI converts queries to responses in a two-step process that begins by transcribing speech into text using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and then feeding that text into a natural language understanding (NLU) model.

 

SoundHound’s approach combines these two steps into one process to track speech in real-time. The company claims this technique allows voice assistants to understand the meaning of user queries, even before the person is finished speaking.

 

Future advancements in computer speech, including the availability of a variety of connectivity options from embedded-only (no cloud connection required) to hybrid (embedded plus cloud) and cloud-only "will give more choice to companies across industries in terms of cost, privacy, and availability of processing power," Zagoresk said. 

 

NVIDIA said its news AI models go beyond voiceover work. 

 

"Text-to-speech can be used in gaming, to aid individuals with vocal disabilities, or to help users translate between languages in their own voice," the company wrote. "It can even recreate the performances of iconic singers, matching not only the melody of a song but also the emotional expression behind the vocals."
