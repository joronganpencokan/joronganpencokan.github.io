# Google Photos Users Beware: You Might Be Running Out of Storage! Learn How to Check Your Remaining Space Now!

If you are an avid Google Photos user who loves to store thousands of photos and videos on the cloud, you may want to check how much space you have left in your account. Google announced that starting June 1, 2021, all new photos and videos uploaded to Google Photos will count towards the 15 GB of free storage that comes with every Google account. This means that if you have been using Google Photos for the past few years without any regard for your storage limit, you may be in for a rude awakening soon.

The good news is that there are ways to check how much storage you have left and take action to free up space or upgrade to a paid plan. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to check your remaining Google Photos storage:

1. Open the Google Photos app or go to photos.google.com on your computer.
2. Click on your profile picture or initials on the top right corner of the screen.
3. Select "Photos settings" from the drop-down menu.
4. Scroll down to "Account storage" to see how much storage you have used and how much is available.
5. If you are close to reaching your limit, you will see a message that says "Almost out of storage" with options to free up space, upgrade your storage plan, or ignore the message.

If you decide to free up space, Google Photos offers several options to help you do so. You can delete unwanted photos and videos, move them to your Google Drive, or use the suggestions feature that automatically detects and groups similar photos for easy deletion.

If you want to upgrade your Google Photos storage plan, there are three options to choose from: 100 GB for $1.99 per month, 200 GB for $2.99 per month, or 2 TB for $9.99 per month. These plans also come with additional Google One features like access to Google experts, extra member benefits, and family sharing.

In conclusion, it's essential for Google Photos users to be aware of their remaining storage and take action if necessary. With the changes in Google's storage policy, it's best to check your storage regularly and make adjustments as needed. By following the steps above, you can ensure that your precious photos and videos are safe and accessible for years to come.
