Understanding the Weapons in Hitman 3

Before we delve into the specifics of switching weapons, let's take a quick look at the types of weapons available in Hitman 3. The game offers a wide variety of weapons, including pistols, rifles, shotguns, and even blunt objects like hammers or fire extinguishers. Each weapon comes with its unique set of stats, making it essential to choose the right one for each mission.

In addition, Hitman 3 features different throwing items, such as coins, knives or bricks, which can be used for distraction or to take down enemies quietly.

Switching Weapons Like a Pro

Now, let's dive into how you can switch weapons effectively and quickly during gameplay. Follow these tips to make the most out of your gear in Hitman 3.

1. Pre-select your weapons: At the beginning of each level, take a few moments to pre-select your weapons. This way, you can easily switch between them without pausing the game or opening the inventory menu. To pre-select a weapon, open the menu and highlight the gear you want to use. Then, select "Set as loadout" to automatically equip the weapons when you start the level.

2. Use the Shortcut Wheel: Hitman 3 comes with a quick-select shortcut wheel that enables you to swap between weapons promptly. To open the wheel, hold down the F1 (PC), LB (Xbox), or L1 (PlayStation) button. This action opens a menu that allows you to select various weapons or items, making it faster than opening the inventory screen.

3. Customize the Shortcut Wheel: The game allows you to customize the Shortcut Wheel, enabling you to add or remove items. To customize the wheel, go to the game's settings, select "Accessibility," and click "Shortcut customization." You can then add or remove any item, making the wheel more convenient to use.

4. Take advantage of the Stash: As you go through different levels in Hitman 3, you'll come across weapons that you might not want to use right away. Instead of discarding these weapons or carrying them around, stash them. You can do this by placing them in boxes or suitcases found across the map, which allows you to swap between weapons quickly.

Conclusion

Switching weapons in Hitman 3 might seem like a small detail, but it can make a world of difference during gameplay. By pre-selecting your loadout, using the Shortcut Wheel, customizing it, and taking advantage of the stash, you can switch weapons faster and more efficiently.

With this ultimate weapon guide, you're now equipped with the knowledge and tools to revamp your game and become a more effective assassin. Now, go ahead and experiment with different weapons and strategies to take down your targets like a pro!
