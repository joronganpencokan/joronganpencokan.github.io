Title: Is Your Smart Home Tech Under Attack? Discover The Shocking Reason Why Malware is Targeting Your Devices

Introduction:
Smart homes have become increasingly popular over the last decade, with homeowners investing in various devices to make their homes safer and more convenient. However, these devices have been targeted in recent years, with hackers exploiting security weaknesses to infiltrate and control them. In this article, we will explore the reason why malware is targeting smart home devices and how you can protect yourself.

Body:
Smart home devices come in various forms, from smart thermostats to security cameras, and these devices are often linked together via a central hub. This hub serves as the main control center, allowing users to manage and control all their devices from a single app. While the convenience is undeniable, it also poses a significant risk - if a hacker gains access to the hub, they can potentially control all the devices linked to it.

One of the reasons why malware is targeting smart home devices is because of the lack of security protocols in most IoT (Internet of Things) devices. These devices often have weak passwords or none at all, making them easy targets for hackers using automated tools to scan for and exploit vulnerabilities. Once a device is compromised, it can be used to launch attacks on other devices connected to the same network.

Another reason why smart home devices are under attack is due to the value of the data they contain. Smart home devices can collect a vast amount of personal data, including our daily routines and habits. This data is valuable to advertisers, who can use it to target specific audiences with personalized ads. However, it's also valuable to hackers, who can use it for identity theft or to blackmail victims. For example, hackers can use footage from a compromised security camera to extort the homeowner.

Furthermore, smart home devices are often not updated regularly, leaving them vulnerable to known exploits. This is because many people assume that their devices are secure and do not need updates. However, without these updates, hackers can exploit known vulnerabilities to gain access to devices without the user's knowledge.

Conclusion:
Smart home devices are under attack from malware due to the lack of security protocols, the value of personal data, and the failure to update regularly. To protect yourself, ensure that all your devices have strong passwords, are updated regularly, and are isolated on separate networks where necessary. It's also crucial to be aware of potential security risks, such as suspicious account activity or strange device behavior. By taking these steps, you can enjoy the convenience of smart home devices without sacrificing your security.

The explosion of unmonitored plug-in-and-forget internet-connected smart devices doesn't just put their owners at risk but could also be used to bring down popular websites and services. 

 
- Security experts have discovered a new malware that attacks internet-connected devices like routers and security cameras to rope them into a botnet.Malware authors are always looking for ways to break into internet-exposed devices to use them for all kinds of nefarious purposes, warn experts.Experts suggest people can thwart such attacks by installing security patches without delay and using fully-updated antimalware products.

 

Researchers have recently discovered a new strain of malware that is attacking security vulnerabilities in several routers. Once infected, the compromised routers are roped inside malicious botnets that cybercriminals use to attack a website or online service with junk traffic and choke them out of service. This is known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack in cybersecurity parlance.

 

"Unfortunately, there are far too many poorly protected systems that can easily be co-opted into these attacks," Ryan Thomas, VP of Product Management at cybersecurity solutions provider LogicHub, told Lifewire over email. "The key for end-users is not to be one of these easy targets."

 
##   We Are the Borg  
 

Researchers at cybersecurity firm Fortinet ran across a new variant of a popular botnet-roping malware that had learned new tricks to assimilate consumer routers. According to their observations, the bad actors behind the Beastmode (aka B3astmode) botnet have "aggressively updated its arsenal of exploits," adding a total of five new exploits, with three of them attacking vulnerabilities in the Totolink routers.

 

Notably, this development came soon after Totolink had released firmware updates to fix the three critical-severity vulnerabilities. So, while the vulnerabilities have been patched, the attackers are betting on the fact that many users take time before updating the firmware on their devices, and some never do. 

 

The Beastmode botnet borrows its code from the very potent Mirai botnet. Before their arrest in 2018, the Mirai botnet operators had open sourced the code of their deadly botnet, enabling other cybercriminals like Beastmode to copy it and infuse new features to exploit more devices.

 

According to Fortinet, in addition to Totolink, the Beastmode malware also targets vulnerabilities in several D-Link routers, a TP-Link IP camera, network video recording devices from Nuuo, as well as Netgear's ReadyNAS Surveillance products. Worryingly, several targeted D-Link products have been discontinued and will not get a security update from the company, leaving them vulnerable.

 

"Once devices are infected by Beastmode, the botnet can be used by its operators to perform a variety of DDoS attacks commonly found in other Mirai-based botnets," wrote the researchers. 

 

Botnet operators make money by either hawking their botnet made up of several thousand compromised devices to other cybercriminals, or they can launch the DDoS attacks themselves, then demand a ransom from the victim to cease the attacks. According to Imperva, DDoS attacks potent enough to cripple a website for days can be bought for as little as $5/hour.

 
##   Routers and More  
 

While Fortinet suggests that people apply security updates to all their internet-connected devices without any delay, Thomas suggests that the threat isn't just restricted to devices like routers and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices like baby monitors and home security cameras.

 

"Malware is becoming more insidious and clever at roping end-user systems into becoming part of a botnet," pointed out Thomas. He suggested that all PC users should ensure their antimalware tools stay up-to-date. Furthermore, everyone should do everything they can to avoid suspicious sites, as well as phishing attacks.

 

According to TrendMicro, an uncharacteristically slow internet connection is one of the signs of a compromised router. Many botnets also change the login credentials of a compromised device, so if you are unable to log into your internet-connected device using existing credentials (and you're confident you're not keying in the wrong password), there's a high chance that malware has infiltrated your device, and altered its login details. 

 

When it comes to malware infecting computers, Thomas said consumers should make it a habit to monitor the CPU usage of their systems at regular intervals. This is because many botnets also include cryptomining malware that steals and hogs your computer's processor to mine cryptocurrencies. 

 

"If your system is running fast with no obvious connections, this could be a sign that it's part of a botnet," warned Thomas. "So when you're not using your laptop, shut it down completely."
