# Discover the Secret Technique for Creating Multiple Gmail Aliases - Save Time and Boost Your Productivity Today!

As a busy professional, you probably have multiple email accounts that you use for different purposes. You may have one for work, one for personal use, and maybe even one for online shopping. But, did you know that you can create multiple Gmail aliases that can help you streamline your email management? In this article, we’ll show you how to discover the secret technique for creating multiple Gmail aliases and how it can save you time and boost your productivity today!

## What are Gmail Aliases?

Before we dive into the technique for creating multiple Gmail aliases, let’s first define what they are. Simply put, a Gmail alias is an alternative address that you can use to receive emails without having to create a separate email account. When you set up an alias, any emails that are sent to that address will still go to your primary Gmail inbox.

## The Benefits of Using Multiple Gmail Aliases

There are several benefits to using multiple Gmail aliases. First and foremost, it helps you to categorize and organize your emails better. When you have multiple aliases, you can filter and sort your emails based on their purpose. This can help you to prioritize your email management and respond to important messages faster.

Additionally, using multiple Gmail aliases can help to protect your privacy. If you’re someone who receives a lot of spam or promotional emails, you can create a separate alias for those messages that you don’t want cluttering up your primary inbox. This way, you can access those emails when you need to, without having to sift through irrelevant messages.

## How to Create Multiple Gmail Aliases

Now that we’ve covered the benefits of using multiple Gmail aliases, let’s dive into the technique for creating them. Follow these steps to create your first alias:

1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Click on the gear icon on the top right of your screen and select ‘Settings.’
3. Click on the ‘Accounts and Import’ tab.
4. Scroll down to the ‘Send mail as’ section and click on ‘Add another email address.’
5. Enter the desired name and email address for your alias and click ‘Next.’
6. In the next screen, select ‘Send through Gmail (easier to set up)’ and click ‘Next.’
7. Confirm the email address and click ‘Send Verification.’

Once you’ve completed these steps, Gmail will send a verification email to the email address that you’ve provided. Simply click the verification link in that email to confirm your alias.

## Tips for Using Multiple Gmail Aliases

Now that you know how to create multiple Gmail aliases, here are some tips for using them effectively:

- Create aliases for different purposes, like work, personal, and shopping.
- Use filters and labels to sort your emails based on their purpose.
- Set up automatic responses for certain aliases if you receive a lot of similar emails.
- Use your aliases consistently to avoid confusion for your contacts.

## Conclusion

Creating multiple Gmail aliases is a simple yet effective technique that can help you save time and boost your productivity. By organizing your emails based on their purpose, you can prioritize your email management and respond to important messages faster. Plus, using aliases can help to protect your privacy and keep your inbox clutter-free. So, what are you waiting for? Give it a try today and see how it can improve your email management!

This article explains how to create a Gmail alias, whether you want a temporary alias or a permanent one.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Temporary: Add one or more special characters to your main email address.Permanent: Set Gmail to direct mail from another address to your primary address.Either method allows you to use more than one address within the same Gmail account.

 
##   How to Add a Temporary Alias to Gmail  
 

When signing up with a new website or online service, insert a period somewhere in your normal Gmail address. For example, if your address is "johndoe@gmail.com," typing "john.doe@gmail.com" creates an instant alias. Insert the period anywhere you like, and insert as many as you like. For instance, "j.o.h.n.d.o.e@gmail.com" works just fine.

 

As strange as such aliases look to the casual observer, Gmail treats them as identical to your original address. Anything sent to "j.o.h.n.d.o.e@gmail.com" will actually be sent to “johndoe@gmail.com."

 

You also can create a temporary alias using a plus sign at the end of the address. For example, "johndoe+@gmail.com" is a temporary alias, although "john+doe@gmail" isn't (messages sent to such an address will fail). You can type any gobbledegook after the plus sign, such as "johndoe+fsnsfsfwwgnj@gmail.com," and mail sent to this still goes to your address.

 

Of course, you might wonder what the point of this is. One useful trick involving temporary aliases is to create filters that put emails sent to one email address, such as, "john.doe@gmail.com," in a folder other than your inbox. This way, you can prevent your inbox from buckling under the weight of too many promotional emails.

 

To create a filter for a temporary alias:

 
- Navigate to Gmail in a web browser and select the Search options icon on the search bar.
 - Click the triangular Search options icon on the right-hand side of the search bar.
 - In the dropdown menu that appears, type the temporary alias' address into the To field.
 - Click Create filter.
 - Scroll down and select the Choose category dropdown submenu. Click the category to which you'd like the emails to be sent, such as Promotions.
 - Click Create filter.

 
##   How to Permanently Add an Alias to Gmail  
 

The other way of creating a Gmail alias is useful if you already have multiple email addresses and would like a time-saving way of checking all your mail in one place.

 

Navigate to Gmail in a web browser and select the Search options icon on the search bar.

 

Click the triangular Search options icon on the right-hand side of the search bar.

 

In the dropdown menu that appears, type the temporary alias' address into the To field.

 

Click Create filter.

 

Scroll down and select the Choose category dropdown submenu. Click the category to which you'd like the emails to be sent, such as Promotions.

 

In this example, suppose you have two email addresses, "johndoe@gmail.com" and "janedoe@gmail.com." Here's how to add the latter as a permanent alias of the former, so that mail sent to "janedoe@gmail.com" is also sent to "johndoe@gmail.com."

 
- In Gmail, click the Settings cogwheel in the top-right corner of the screen.
 - Click See all settings.
 - Click the Accounts and Import tab.

 - Enter the email address you'd like to add as an alias (e.g. "janedoe@gmail.com").
 - Click Next.
 - Click Next.
 - Enter the password for the address you'd like to add (this is the password you use to login to that address and its account), and click Add Account.
