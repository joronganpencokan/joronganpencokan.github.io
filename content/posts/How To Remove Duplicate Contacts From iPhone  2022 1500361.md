Say Goodbye to iPhone Overload in 2022: Remove Duplicate Contacts in One Easy Step!

If you are someone who owns an iPhone, chances are, you have experienced the frustration that comes with having duplicate contacts on your device. Having multiple entries of the same person can make searching for contacts and messaging a difficulty, at times even causing the phone to crash or freeze up.

However, the good news is that you can say goodbye to iPhone overload in 2022 with one easy step- removing duplicate contacts. Here's how:

Step 1: Backup your contacts

Before initiating the process, start by creating a backup of your iPhone contacts. This is essential to ensure that you do not lose any precious data during the deleting process. One of the most convenient ways to back up your contacts is through iCloud. Simply go to Settings > [your name] > iCloud > iCloud Backup > Backup Now.

Step 2: Use a third-party app

Using a third-party app is one of the easiest and quickest ways to remove duplicate contacts. There are numerous options available in the App Store that can help. These apps scan your device for duplicate contacts and remove them automatically. Some of the popular apps include Simpler Merge and Contacts+.

Step 3: Check for duplicates manually

If you don't want to use a third-party app, you can also remove duplicates manually. Start by launching the Contacts app on your iPhone, and then select "All Contacts." Scroll through your contacts list and look for any duplicate entries.

Once you find a duplicate entry, click on it, and select "Edit." Scroll down to the bottom of the screen and click on "Delete Contact." Repeat this process for all duplicate contacts.

Step 4: Merge contacts

If you come across contacts that have similar information, instead of deleting them, it's best to merge them. To do this, choose one of the contacts and select "Edit." Scroll down to the bottom and click on "Link Contacts." Then select the contact you want to merge with and click on "Link."

In conclusion, removing duplicate contacts is an easy and effective way to declutter your iPhone and reduce the risk of it crashing. Use a third-party app or remove duplicates manually, back up your contacts, and merge any similar contacts. With these simple steps, you can say goodbye to iPhone overload in 2022!
