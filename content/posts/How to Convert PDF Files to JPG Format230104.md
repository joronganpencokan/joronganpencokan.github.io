# Unlock the Secret to Easy PDF to JPG Conversion with These Mind-Blowing Tips!

Whether you’re a student, an office worker, or just someone who works with documents on a regular basis, chances are you’ve had to convert a PDF file to a JPG image at some point. And if you’ve done it before, you know how frustrating it can be when the images come out blurry, the colors look washed-out, or the file size is too big. But fear not, because we’ve compiled a list of mind-blowing tips that will help you unlock the secret to easy PDF to JPG conversion. 

## Tip #1: Use Online Conversion Tools

The easiest and most convenient way to convert a PDF file to a JPG image is to use an online conversion tool. There are plenty of free online tools available that can convert your PDF files into JPG images in just a few seconds. Some popular online conversion tools include Smallpdf, Convertio, and Zamzar. These tools are easy to use and usually offer a wide range of options when it comes to file types and sizes. 

## Tip #2: Use Adobe Acrobat

If you have Adobe Acrobat installed on your computer, you can use it to convert your PDF files to JPG images. This method is particularly useful if you need to convert multiple files at once or if you want more control over the conversion process. To convert a PDF file to a JPG image using Adobe Acrobat, simply open the PDF file, select “Save As Other” from the “File” menu, and choose “Image” as the file type. From there, you can select “JPEG” as the image format and customize the image quality and resolution settings to your liking. 

## Tip #3: Adjust the Image Quality Settings

One of the most common problems people encounter when converting PDF files to JPG images is that the images come out blurry or pixelated. This is usually because the image quality settings weren’t adjusted correctly. To avoid this problem, make sure to adjust the image quality settings before converting your PDF file to a JPG image. If you’re using an online conversion tool, look for options to adjust the image resolution or quality. If you’re using Adobe Acrobat, you can adjust the image quality settings in the “Save As Image” dialog box. 

## Tip #4: Compress the Images

Converting a PDF file to a JPG image can result in a large file size, which can be a problem if you’re working with limited storage space. One way to reduce the file size is to compress the images. Many online conversion tools and image editing software (such as Adobe Photoshop) offer options to compress images without significantly reducing the quality. Compressing the images can help you save storage space and make it easier to share the files with others. 

## Tip #5: Check the DPI

Finally, make sure to check the DPI (dots per inch) of your images before converting the PDF file to a JPG image. DPI refers to the number of dots per inch in an image and is a measure of the image’s resolution. The higher the DPI, the higher the resolution (and the larger the file size). In most cases, a resolution of 300 DPI is sufficient for most applications. However, if you’re printing the image or need a higher resolution for other reasons, you may need to increase the DPI. 

In conclusion, converting a PDF file to a JPG image can be easier than you think if you follow these mind-blowing tips. Using online conversion tools, adjusting the image quality settings, compressing the images, checking the DPI, and using Adobe Acrobat can all help you achieve the results you want. So the next time you need to convert a PDF file to a JPG image, remember these tips and make the process a breeze!

This article explains how to convert a PDF to a JPG file. When you save a PDF to the JPG format, the document no longer needs to be opened with a PDF reader and can instead be viewed with most image viewers.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Use a free online convertor like PDFtoJPG.net or Pixillion, or download PDF to JPEG for Windows.
 - On Mac, open the PDF to launch Preview and select File > Export > JPG.
 - To extract pictures from a PDF and convert them to JPG, use I Love PDF. To merge PDF pages into one large JPG, use Filesmerge.com.

 
##   PDF-to-JPG Conversion Tools  
 

There are several ways to save whole pages from a PDF to the JPG format. The method you choose to use should depend primarily on the operating system you’re using and whether you already have the converter on your computer.

 
###   PDFtoJPG.net  
 

PDFtoJPG.net is one of the easiest places to convert each page of the PDF to a separate image in the JPG format. This PDF converter works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and any other operating system that supports a browser. Just upload the PDF to that website, choose the JPG quality, wait for the conversion to JPG, and then download any of the pages as JPG, or download a ZIP of all the converted pages.

 
###   Pixillion  
 

Pixillion is a free image file converter for Windows and macOS that lets you load a PDF into the program and then convert it to JPG. You can also adjust the resolution, scale the images, flip the pages, rotate the pages, add a watermark to the images, and more. Each page in the PDF will save as a separate JPG file.

 
PDFtoJPG.me is similar but accepts larger PDFs and lets you pick a range of pages to convert.
 
###   PDF to JPEG Windows App  
 

If you have at least Windows 8, you might prefer to use the PDF to JPEG Windows app. Just open the PDF in that program, pick a folder, and then hit the Convert button to make a JPG for each page of the PDF.

 
###   PDF to JPG Mac App  
 

macOS users are best off using the built-in PDF tool to convert PDF to JPG. Open the PDF to launch Preview (or open Preview first and go to File > Open… if it doesn’t start automatically), and then pick JPG through the File > Export… menu option. You can also right-click any of the pages from the left pane to export the PDF page to JPG.

 
###   Photoshop  
 

If you have Adobe Photoshop already on your computer, you can use it to convert a PDF page to JPG. Just open the PDF like you would any image, pick the Pages option, and then use the File > Save As... menu option to save the page as a JPG image file.

 
###   Adobe Acrobat  
 

Adobe Acrobat is similar to Photoshop: it’s not free but if you have it, it’s perfect for converting PDF to JPG. Open the PDF and then go to File > Export To > Image > JPEG to convert all the PDF pages to JPG files.

 

There is, however, a free version of the converter function that you can access on Adobe's Convert PDF to JPG web page. You can pick from several image quality levels, and there are three export formats: JPG, PNG, and TIFF. You'll need to sign in to your Adobe account to get the download link, but making an account is free.

 
###   Other Tools  
 

Some other PDF to JPG converters, some of which support batch conversions, include PDFNob, PDFMate PDF Converter, UniPDF, DocuFreezer, Boxoft PDF to JPG, LightPDF, Icecream PDF Converter, and UnitePDF. Some PDF splitters can also perform this task.

 
##   Merge JPG Pages Into One File  
 

If you don’t want the converted PDF pages to be separate, individual JPGs but instead just one large JPG file with all the pages merged together, you have to use an entirely different tool. Filesmerge.com is one example of a website that can merge all the JPG pages into one file, either horizontally or vertically, which might be easier to send or store rather than keeping all of the pages as separate files.

 
DocuFreezer produces a watermark on all the converted pages if you use the free version, and PDFNob, LightPDF, and UnitePDF are the only ones from that list that work online; the others are programs you install to your computer.
 
##   Convert PDF Images to JPGs  
 

Another way to convert a PDF to JPG is if you want to save the images from the PDF to the JPG format. In other words, you can extract all the pictures from a PDF and convert each of them to JPG.

 

One way to do this from any operating system is with an online PDF to JPG converter. I Love PDF is one of the better ways to do this because you can load the PDF from (and save the JPGs to) your computer, your Google Drive account, or Dropbox. If multiple JPGs are extracted, you’ll get them in a ZIP file.

 
##   PDF-to-JPG Conversions  
 

A PDF-to-JPG conversion is often useful when sharing a PDF because you don’t have to worry about the other person having a PDF viewer or plug-in on their computer, or a PDF opener on their phone. However, there are some disadvantages to doing this, which you should consider before making the conversion.

 
You can also get JPG images from a PDF using Photoshop (pick the Images option after choosing the PDF to open) or Adobe Acrobat (Tools > Export PDF > Image > Export all images).
 

Another way to save a PDF as a JPEG file is to use a special converter that only converts the images from the PDF. You might use this type of converter if you only want the pictures from the PDF; the converter will extract the PDF’s images and save each of them to the JPG format.

 
##   Should You Do It?  
 

While there are benefits to saving a PDF to JPG, it’s important to know what actually happens when you do the conversion. Since a PDF is a document, and a JPG an image, two completely different types of files, you can't convert without losing some aspects of the PDF.

 

For example, if you ever want to edit the text within the PDF, you might consider keeping it in the PDF format (or at least not deleting the original after the conversion). While most PDFs can be edited using a PDF editor, most of them probably can’t do the same to a JPG, and you'll likely have a hard time finding a good JPG to text converter.

 

Another issue with these converters is that during the conversion, any embedded content like bookmarks or audio are lost and unusable in the JPG. Unless you keep the original PDF to access those things, you can never get them back, since you can’t convert JPG to PDF and expect to retrieve those embeddable objects.
