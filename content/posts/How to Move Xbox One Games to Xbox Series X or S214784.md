Connect your external hard drive to your Xbox One using a USB cable. Once your Xbox One recognizes your external hard drive, it will ask you to format your external hard drive. Choose "Format Storage Device" to format your external hard drive.

Step 4: Transfer Your Xbox One Games

After formatting your external hard drive, you can now start transferring your Xbox One games. Go to My Games and Apps, and then choose "Manage Game." From there, choose "Move all games to external storage." This process may take a while depending on how many games you have.

Step 5: Connect Your External Hard Drive to Your Next-Gen Xbox Series X or S

Finally, after transferring your Xbox One games to your external hard drive, you can now connect your external hard drive to your next-gen Xbox Series X or S. Simply plug in your external hard drive to your new console, and you are good to go! All your Xbox One games are now available on your new console.
