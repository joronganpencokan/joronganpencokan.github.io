# Revolutionize Your Excel Skills: Learn How To Easily Insert Checkboxes to Streamline Your Work!

Are you tired of manually checking multiple cells in your Excel spreadsheets? Do you wish there was an easier way to track completed tasks or select multiple options from a list? Look no further than the humble checkbox! By incorporating checkboxes into your Excel workflow, you can streamline your work and make your spreadsheets more user-friendly.

## How to Insert Checkboxes in Excel

To insert a checkbox in Excel, you'll first need to activate the Developer tab on your ribbon. To do this, head to File > Options > Customize Ribbon and check the box next to "Developer" under "Main Tabs." Once you've done that, you can follow these simple steps:

1. Click on the Developer tab in your ribbon.
2. Click the "Insert" dropdown menu and select "Checkbox (Form Control)" or "Checkbox (ActiveX Control)" depending on your needs.
3. Click and drag to create a checkbox in your desired location on the spreadsheet.

That's it – you've just inserted a checkbox in Excel! To customize the checkbox, right-click on it and select "Format Control" from the dropdown menu. From there, you can change the checkbox alignment, size, and other properties.

## How to Use Checkboxes in Excel

So, now that you've inserted a checkbox, how do you actually use it? There are a number of different ways to incorporate checkboxes into your Excel workflow, depending on your needs. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

- Track completed tasks: Insert a checkbox next to each task in a to-do list. Whenever you finish a task, simply check the corresponding box to mark it as completed. This will make it easy to track your progress and ensure you don't overlook any important items.
- Select multiple options: Create a list of options (e.g. product features, menu items, etc.) and insert a checkbox next to each one. Users can then select multiple options by checking the corresponding boxes. This is a great way to streamline data entry and ensure accuracy.
- Filter a table: If you have a table with multiple columns, you can insert checkboxes in a "Filter" column to quickly and easily filter the table based on certain criteria. For example, if you have a table of customer orders, you could insert checkboxes next to each product type (e.g. "Apparel", "Accessories", etc.) and use them to filter the table based on the selected product types.

## Conclusion

Incorporating checkboxes into your Excel workflow is a simple but effective way to streamline your work and make your spreadsheets more user-friendly. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily insert checkboxes in Excel and use them to track tasks, select options, and filter tables. So why not give it a try and see how much time and effort it can save you?

This article explains how to add the Developer tab to the ribbon, how to add single or multiple checkboxes, and how to delete a checkbox. Instructions apply to Excel 2019, Excel 2016, Excel 2013, Excel 2010, Excel 2007, Excel for Microsoft 365, and Excel for the web.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- You need to have the Developer tab in the ribbon. From there, select Insert > checkbox icon and place the box where desired.
 - If you need a lot of checkboxes, the quickest method is to create the first one and then copy/paste the rest as needed.

 
##   How to Insert a Checkbox in Excel  
 

Here's how to add a checkbox in Excel. (It's very similar to the way checkboxes are inserted in Microsoft Word.)

 
- Make sure you have the Developer tab in your ribbon. If you don't see it, you can add it by going to File > Options > Customize Ribbon and selecting the Developer checkbox. Click OK.
 - If you have Excel 2007, click the Microsoft Office and select Excel Options > Popular > Show Developer tab in the Ribbon.
 - In the Developer tab, select Insert, then select the Checkbox icon under Form Controls.
 - In the spreadsheet, click where you want to place the checkbox. You can immediately begin typing to edit the default text after the checkbox appears, or you can right-click on the checkbox to edit other characteristics.
 - Options for the checkbox formatting include fill color, text color, borders, and other options. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting Format Control.

 
##   How to Create Multiple Checkboxes in Excel  
 

The Checkbox function in the Developer tab only allows you to add a single checkbox at a time. However, once you have a few on your page you can select multiple checkboxes and use copy/paste to add more items to your spreadsheet quickly. Doing this is a little tricky since left-clicking on a checkbox just checks/unchecks the box itself.

 
Excel Online does not support the checkbox function.
 

Make sure you have the Developer tab in your ribbon. If you don't see it, you can add it by going to File > Options > Customize Ribbon and selecting the Developer checkbox. Click OK.

 

If you have Excel 2007, click the Microsoft Office and select Excel Options > Popular > Show Developer tab in the Ribbon.

 

In the Developer tab, select Insert, then select the Checkbox icon under Form Controls.

 

In the spreadsheet, click where you want to place the checkbox. You can immediately begin typing to edit the default text after the checkbox appears, or you can right-click on the checkbox to edit other characteristics.

 

Options for the checkbox formatting include fill color, text color, borders, and other options. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting Format Control.

 
Any edits to the checkbox must be done using a right-click; a left-click will check or uncheck the box.
 

To copy/paste a checkbox, use right-click and select Copy. Then, right-click where you want the new checkbox to go and select Paste. You can then right-click on the checkbox again if you want to edit the text or formatting.

 
##   How to Delete a Checkbox in Excel  
 

Have a checkbox you don't want to check anymore? How to delete a checkbox isn't immediately obvious, since regular clicks just toggle the check on and off. To get rid of a checkbox, right-click on it and select Cut. That's it! Just don't paste it anywhere and the checkbox is now safely out of your spreadsheet.

 
You may find it easier to enter your line items in regular cells on the Excel sheet and then add a checkbox without using the checkbox text. When you click to place your checkbox, just click and highlight the text, and press the Delete key. Using Copy/Paste to duplicate checkboxes is a lot more efficient this way, and it makes editing the text easier as well.
