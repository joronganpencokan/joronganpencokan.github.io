# Unlock The Excel Secret: Learn How To Control Your Spreadsheet Cells Like A Pro In 2023!

Are you tired of struggling with Excel spreadsheets? Do you wish you could control your cells like a pro? Well, 2023 is the year for you! It's time to unlock the Excel secret and take control of your spreadsheet once and for all.

As we move into an era where data is king, being able to manipulate and analyze it all within a spreadsheet is becoming increasingly important. However, Excel can be a tricky program to master. That's why it's important to turn to the top experts and resources to help you develop your skills.

One of the best ways to learn Excel is to start with the basics. Understanding how formulas work, how to format cells, and how to use functions are all fundamental skills that can help you control your spreadsheet with ease. There are many online courses and tutorials available for free or at a low cost that can teach you the basics.

Once you have a strong foundation, it's time to move on to more advanced techniques. For example, you can use Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to automate some of your spreadsheet tasks. This programming language can help you create macros, which are sets of instructions that run automatically. With macros, you can save time and reduce human error in your spreadsheet.

Another way to take your Excel skills to the next level is to learn pivots. Pivot tables are a powerful tool for summarizing large amounts of data quickly and easily. They allow you to see patterns, trends, and outliers in your data that would be difficult to spot otherwise.

Finally, consider learning about add-ins. These are programs that can enhance the capabilities of Excel. For example, the Solver add-in can help you find the optimal solution to a problem, while the Analysis ToolPak can perform complex statistical analysis.

In conclusion, if you want to control your spreadsheet like a pro in 2023, it's important to start with the basics and then move on to more advanced techniques. Take advantage of online courses and tutorials, learn VBA, master pivots, and explore add-ins. With persistence and dedication, you can unlock the Excel secret and become a data master in no time.

Sometimes you don’t want some cells in your excel sheets to be altered. You can do so by learning how to lock or unlock cells in excel. 
 
Microsoft Excel provides us with an excellent way to store our data in a tabulated and organized form. But this data can be altered when shared among other people. If you want to protect your data from deliberate changes, then you can protect your Excel sheets by locking them. But, this is an extreme step that may not be preferable. Instead, you can lock particular cells, rows, and columns too. For instance, you can allow users to enter specific data but lock the cells with important information. In this article, we’ll see different ways to lock or unlock cells in Excel.

4. If you choose to enter the password, a ‘confirm password’ dialogue box will appear. Type your password again to finish the process.

### How to Unlock Particular Cells in a Protected Sheet?
 
Sometimes you may want to edit specific cells in your Protected Excel sheet. By using this method, you can unlock individual cells on your sheet using a password:
 
1. Select the cells or ranges that you need to unlock in a protected sheet by a password.
 
2. In the ‘Review’ tab, click on the ‘Allow users to edit Ranges’ option. You need to unlock your sheet first to access the option.
 
3. The ‘Allow users to Edit Ranges’ dialogue box appears. Click on the ‘New’ option. 
 
4. A ‘New Range’ dialogue box appears with Title, Refers to cells, and Range password field.
 
5. In the Title field, give a name to your range. In the ‘Refers to cell’ field, type the range of cells. It already has the selected cells range by default.
 
6. Type the password in the Password field and click on OK.
 
7. Type the password again in the ‘confirm password’ dialogue box and click OK. 
 
8. A new range will be added. You can follow the steps again to create more ranges.
 
9. Click on the ‘Protect Sheet’ button.
 
10. Type a password in the ’Protect Sheet’ window for the entire sheet and choose the actions you want to allow. Click OK.
 
11. Type the password again in the confirmation window, and your work is done.  
 
Now, even though your sheet is protected, some of the protected cells will have an extra protection level and would be unlocked only with a password. You can also give access to the ranges without having to enter a password every time:
 
1. When you made the range, click on the ‘Permissions’ option first.
 
2. Click on Add button in the window. Enter the name of the users in the ‘Enter the object names to select’ box. You can type the user name of the person as stored in your domain. Click on OK.
 
3. Now specify the permission for each user under ‘Group or user names’ and check the Allow option. Click on OK, and your work is done.
