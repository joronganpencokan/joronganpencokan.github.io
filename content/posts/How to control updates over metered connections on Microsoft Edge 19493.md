# Stop Wasting Money on Data Charges! Learn How to Control Microsoft Edge Updates on Metered Connections NOW!

Are you tired of receiving high data charges every time you update your Microsoft Edge browser? If so, you are not alone. Many people struggle to manage their internet usage and end up paying hefty fees for their data consumption. However, there is a way to control Microsoft Edge updates on metered connections without compromising your browsing experience. In this article, we will explore some tips and tricks to help you save money on data charges.

## What are Metered Connections?

Before we delve into the details, let us first define what metered connections are. In simple terms, a metered connection is any type of internet connection with a cap on data usage. This can include mobile data plans, Wi-Fi hotspots or any other connection where data usage is limited by the service provider. Therefore, if you are using a metered connection, you need to be more cautious about your data usage than if you were on an unlimited plan.

## Why You Should Control Microsoft Edge Updates on Metered Connections

If you are on a metered connection and your Microsoft Edge browser is set to automatically update, you risk consuming a large amount of data without even realizing it. Each time an update is released, it may download in the background, eating up your data plan. Normally, these updates might be minor and unnoticeable. However, there are instances where Microsoft Edge updates can be large, taking up several hundred megabytes that you did not plan for.

## How to Control Microsoft Edge Updates on Metered Connections

The good news is that you can control Microsoft Edge updates on metered connections. Here are some tips you can follow:

### 1. Switch Off Automatic Updates

The first and most obvious solution is to disable automatic updates. To do this, open your Microsoft Edge browser and click on the three horizontal dots at the top right corner of the screen. From there, click on "Settings" > "About this app" and turn off the toggle switch next to "Update this app automatically." This will ensure that updates are not downloaded automatically, giving you control over when to use your data plan.

### 2. Set Updates to Only Occur on Wi-Fi

Microsoft Edge has an option that allows you to choose whether you want to download updates over Wi-Fi only. This means that even if automatic updates are enabled, they will only take place when you are connected to a Wi-Fi network. To set this up, go to "Settings" > "About this app" and turn on the toggle switch next to "Download updates over Wi-Fi only."

### 3. Meter Your Internet Connection

If you are not sure whether you are on a metered connection, you can easily check by going to "Settings" > "Network & Internet" > "Data Usage." From there, you can view your data usage and check whether you have set your connection as metered. If it is currently not set as metered, you can easily do so by turning on the toggle switch next to "Set as metered connection."

## Conclusion

In conclusion, controlling Microsoft Edge updates on metered connections is essential if you want to save money on data charges. You can either switch off automatic updates, set updates to only occur on Wi-Fi or meter your internet connection. By following these tips, you will gain greater control over your data usage and enjoy browsing the internet without worrying about data charges.

An example of this type of connection are cellular data or services that offer a set amount of data during a certain period.
