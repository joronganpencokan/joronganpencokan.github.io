Title: Unlock the Most Powerful Moves in Final Fantasy VII: Learn How to Obtain Limit Breaks Now!

Introduction:

Final Fantasy VII is a classic role-playing game that has been enjoyed by millions of players around the globe. It offers a vast world with memorable characters, an engaging narrative, and an intricate battle system. One of the game's challenging battle mechanics is obtaining Limit Breaks, which are the characters' most powerful moves. In this article, we will explore how to obtain Limit Breaks and help you understand their importance in unleashing the ultimate firepower in the game.

Understanding Limit Breaks:

Limit Breaks are the most powerful moves that characters can execute in Final Fantasy VII. They deal substantial damage and can turn the tide of any battle. The Limit Breaks are unique to each character, and they vary in strength and effect. To obtain a character's Limit Breaks, players must fill up the character's Limit Break gauge meter during battles. The meter fills up as the character receives damage, deals damage, or takes certain actions in combat. Once the gauge is full, the character can unleash their Limit Break move.

How to Obtain Limit Breaks:

1. Use the character's regular attacks:
One of the ways to fill up the Limit Break gauge is to use the character's regular attacks. Each character's standard attack will fill up the gauge differently, so it's worth experimenting with each character to see what works best.

2. Take damage:
Characters also receive damage, which fills up the Limit Break gauge. However, this method requires the character to survive long enough for the gauge to fill up, so it's best to use it sparingly.

3. Deal damage:
Similar to taking damage, dealing damage also fills up the Limit Break gauge. It's worth noting that some enemies are more vulnerable to certain types of attacks, so it's vital to exploit their weakness to fill up the gauge quicker.

4. Perform certain actions:
Finally, some Limit Breaks require specific actions to be performed. For example, Tifa's Limit Break requires the player to input a specific button combination. Aeris's Limit Break requires her to use her healing spells a specific number of times.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, Limit Breaks are critical to Final Fantasy VII's gameplay mechanics, and mastering them will undoubtedly make battles easier. Understanding how to obtain them is only half the battle. Players must also experiment with each character's Limit Breaks to find their strengths and weaknesses. With the right strategy and plenty of practice, players can unlock the most potent moves in Final Fantasy VII and conquer the game's toughest challenges.

Final Fantasy VII introduced the concept of Limit Breaks, special attacks that characters can use when they've sustained a certain amount of damage. Here's how they work and how to get Final Fantasy VII Limit Breaks for every party member.

 
##   The Basics of Limit Breaks  
 

During battle, you’ll notice a gauge labeled Limit. To trigger a Limit Break attack, that gauge must be full. Every time a character takes damage from an enemy, the Limit Gauge fills a little bit. Get hit enough and, eventually, you’ll get a Limit Break.

 
Instructions in this article apply to Final Fantasy VII for the original PlayStation and the re-release for Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC.
 
##   Advanced Strategy for Building Up the Limit Break Gauge  
 

Just because you get a Limit Break doesn’t mean you have to use it. The gauge doesn't deplete between battles, so if you get a Limit Break during one battle, you can carry it into another. Since Limit Breaks are among the most powerful attacks in the game, filling your gauge before a boss battle can be a huge part of your strategy.

 

If you want to build a character's Limit Break gauge faster, try placing them in the front row. Enemies attack characters up front much more frequently. To facilitate the process even further, equip the character with the Cover Materia, which lets the character take blows meant for other party members. Additionally, the Hyper status causes the Limit Gauge to fill at twice the normal rate at the expense of attack accuracy. It’s worth it to make the character whose Limit Break you’re attempting to trigger Hyper and, when you’re finished, cure the Hyper status with a Tranquilizer.

 
##   How To Get More Limit Breaks  
 

Unlocking Limit Breaks works the same way for most characters in the game. There are four levels of Limit Breaks. Each character starts with a Level 1 Break. To unlock the second, they have to use the first one a certain number of times. To unlock the first Level 2 Limit Break, a character has to kill a certain number of enemies. Then, the process repeats to obtain the next Limit Breaks.

 

Once you collect six Limit Breaks for a character, you will meet the requirements to unlock their Level 4 Limit Break. Unlike the previous ones, Level 4 Limit Breaks must be unlocked by questing for an item. Use the item on the character to unlock their final Limit Break.

 
##   Limit Breaks By Character  
 

Here is the full list of Limit Breaks for all of Final Fantasy VII's characters, along with instructions on how to unlock them.

 
##   Cloud Strife  
 

For his Limit Breaks, Cloud unleashes powerful sword attacks.

 
##   Aeris Gainsborough  
 

Aeris's Limit Breaks all focus on healing and status buffs.

 
##   Tifa Lockhart  
 

Tifa’s Limit Breaks have the added element of a reel that can allow for extra damage if you land on a “Yeah!” space. However, if you land on a “Miss!” space, that attack won’t cause damage to the enemy. You don’t have to stop the reels, and often it’s not worth the risk to try. Also, each of her Limit Breaks combines with the last, so by the time you get her Level 4 Limit Break, she’ll do a seven-move combo.

 
##   Barret Wallace  
 

Barret uses powerful gun attacks for his Limit Breaks.

 
##   Red XIII  
 

Red XII has a mix of offense and defensive Limit Breaks.

 
##   Cait Sith  
 

Cait Sith only has two Limit Breaks, but they can be very powerful.

 
##   Cid Highwind  
 

Cid can perform attacks with assistance from his airship.

 
##   Yuffie Kigaragi  
 

Yuffie is an optional character who uses mostly offense Limit Breaks.

 
##   Vincent Valentine  
 

Vincent Valentine only has one Limit Break per level, as he transforms into a unique creature for the rest of the battle.

 
- How do I remove a character's Limit Break?
 - Open the Main Menu and select Limit, choose the character to change, then set the Limit Break to a different level, if available. This will change the assigned Limit Break and will also reset the gauge back to zero.
 - How do I stop Vincent's Limit Break?
 - There are only two ways to put a stop to Vincent's limit break once he gets going: He gets knocked out or the battle ends. If you want to stop him before the battle is over (if, for example, his magic attacks are healing the enemy), you'll need to knock him out yourself.
 - How do I start Yuffie's ultimate Limit Break quest?
 - First, complete the Wutai Materia Hunter side quest, then return to Wutai with Yuffie in your party. At the end of the path outside of Godo's house, find and enter the Pagoda—then talk to each floor's boss to start a one-on-one battle. Win all battles and defeat Godo to earn Yuffie's final Limit Break.
 - Why won't Barret use his final Limit Break?
 - If Barret refuses to use his final limit break in battle, you've probably skipped one of his lower-level techniques. Open the main menu and select Limit, then check Barret's available Limit Breaks. If there's a number missing, you'll need to make sure he learns it before his Catastrophe will be available to use.
