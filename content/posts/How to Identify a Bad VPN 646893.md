# Don't Fall Prey to Scamming VPNs - Here's How to Spot the Ones You Should Dump ASAP!

Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, are a popular tool used to maintain online privacy and security. However, not all VPN service providers are created equal, and some can even be detrimental to your cybersecurity. Scamming VPNs can result in data breaches, identity theft, and financial loss. Thus, it is essential to know how to spot them and promptly dump them. Here's how:

## Too Good to Be True Prices

One of the tell-tale signs of a scamming VPN is the price. If a VPN service provider offers an unusually low price compared to its competitors, it might mean insufficient revenue to maintain the service. Consequently, the VPN provider may resort to shady practices to keep the service running, such as logging and monetizing user data, selling bandwidth to third-party users, and displaying unwelcome ads. 

## Untraceable Owners and Locations

Secrecy and lack of transparency are other red flags. Legitimate VPN providers typically provide detailed information about their company, contact details, support systems, and physical locations. If, on the other hand, you can't trace the registration, ownership, location, or jurisdiction of a VPN provider, it's safer to avoid it. 

## Limited Availability of VPN Protocols

Another critical factor to look out for when choosing a dependable VNP provider is the kind of protocols they offer. A trustworthy VPN provider should offer several protocols to choose from, depending on your device and preferences, such as OpenVPN, IKEv2, and L2TP/IPSec. Scamming VPNs usually only offer a single protocol, which may not even be secure, such as the outdated PPTP.

## Vague Policies and Inconsistent Terms of Service

Scrutinizing the policies and terms of service (ToS) of a VPN provider is crucial. These documents outline the rules and regulations of using the service and how the VPN provider handles user data. Nevertheless, some scamming VPNs take advantage of their vague and inconsistent policies to cover up their lack of transparency, underhanded tactics, and questionable practices. 

## Sketchy User Reviews and Ratings

User ratings and reviews can be a powerful tool to gauge the quality and legitimacy of a VPN provider. However, scamming VPNs often trade in fake reviews, ratings, and testimonials to create a false sense of popularity and reliability. Additionally, some VPN providers retaliate against negative reviews or rate themselves highly using multiple accounts.

## Conclusion

Be wary of scamming VPN providers by being vigilant and doing thorough research before committing to one. Always look for VPN service providers that offer reasonable and consistent prices, have identifiable owners and locations, and are transparent about their protocols, policies, and ToS. Ultimately, using a reputable VPN service provider can enhance your online privacy, security, and overall browsing experience. So, don't fall prey to scamming VPNs – spot and dump them ASAP!

You may use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) because it offers enhanced security features or because it can give you access to sites that would usually be blocked. Whatever your reason, use a VPN because it offers you a variety of useful options.
 
Sure, you may suspect that it could have its drawbacks, but you might not think that it’s something to worry about. Actually, if you’re not careful and choose the wrong VPN, you could be sharing more information than you’d like. Discover how you can spot a bad VPN and stay safe online.

## Promises that Are Too Good to Be True
 
Every VPN will brag about everything it has to offer its users, but if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. A VPN could be the world’s fastest in some areas, so that could be true in a way.
 
When a VPN claims that it can unblock every site it comes across, or it uses logos of known streaming services making you think you can easily access it when it doesn’t clearly state it, you know you have to be careful. Take note if you come across a VPN that claims that it can protect you from all kinds of online threats or that it can make your Internet connection four times faster.
 
## It’s Not Changing Your IP Address
 
The idea behind a VPN is for you to feel secure and give you another IP address. A bad VPN won’t change your IP and will also be leaking your information to the world as well.
 
To see if your VPN is working properly, go to What Is My IP Address and take note of what your IP address is without the VPN on. Once you have your IP address, turn on the VPN and refresh the IP address site. If you see the IP address you wrote down without the VPN on, then it’s time to get rid of that VPN.
 
## Vague Details on the Company Who Created the VPN
 
A company that has nothing to hide will give you as much information about themselves as possible. A site that has a VPN you can trust will have a dedicated page where you can read up on at least the basic information about the company.
 
A bad VPN will have very little or no information on the creators of the VPN. A red flag will be that they won’t even have a site so you can get customer support. You also won’t be able to count on any info that will help you fix any issues you might be having with the VPN.
 
## Keep These Red Flags in Mind
 
If you see that a VPN is asking for way too much information to sign up, it’s best to find another one. The less info you have to give about yourself the better.
 
A lousy VPN will also have a short or very hard to follow Privacy Policy. A bad VPN will obviously not care about keeping your information safe and might even leak your real IP. With these types of VPNs, you are most likely to not see any kind of protection from IP leaks. It’s a good idea to make sure this is a feature they mention on their spec list.
 
If the VPN you’re using doesn’t have a kill switch, then it’s time to uninstall it. You should be in control of when you use the VPN and when you don’t.
 
A bad VPN will only have universal benefits and won’t even give any info on the countries it covers or the protocols it supports. A reliable VPN will bombard you with all the great features it has to offer.
 
## Conclusion
 
Just because you found the VPN in a Google search doesn’t mean that you should blindly install it without doing your homework. Do as much research as you can on the VPN you’re thinking of using to stay safe and always read what others who have used it have to say about it. What do you look for in a VPN?
