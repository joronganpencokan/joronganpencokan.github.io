Revolutionary Hack: Install Duplicate Apps on iPhone Without Using Parallel Space!

Are you tired of juggling between multiple social media accounts on your iPhone? Do you wish to use two WhatsApp, Instagram or Facebook accounts simultaneously, but don't want to switch back and forth between them? Well, there's a solution, and it doesn't require you to use a third-party app like Parallel Space.

For iPhone users, Apple's strict policies make it impossible to install multiple versions of the same app. This meant that if you wanted to use two different accounts, you previously had to switch the existing account and log in with the new one. But with this revolutionary hack, you can install duplicate apps on your iPhone without jailbreaking your device.

The trick involves using Apple's Test Flight app; an app used by developers to test their applications before they're released to the public. Now, don't worry, you don't need to be a developer to use Test Flight. Follow the below instructions, and you'll be able to install duplicate apps on your iPhone in no time.

Step 1: Download Test Flight from the App Store.

Step 2: Look for the app you want to duplicate on the App Store (e.g., WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook).

Step 3: Scroll down to the bottom of the app listing and look for "Developer," and click on it.

Step 4: Now, click on the invitation link to join the app's beta program.

Step 5: You'll be taken to Test Flight, where you'll be asked to download the app. Click on the "Install" button and wait for the app to be installed.

Step 6: Once the app is installed, you'll be able to open the app from the Test Flight app. You'll have a duplicate app with a different icon, which you can log in with a different account.

That's it! You now have two instances of the same app on your iPhone without having to switch between the accounts. You can use this hack to install duplicate versions of almost any app that supports the beta program.

It's important to note that installing apps via Test Flight has its limitations. You'll need to join the app's beta program, and not all apps are available for testing through Test Flight. Additionally, beta versions may have glitches or stability issues.

In conclusion, this revolutionary hack for installing duplicate apps on your iPhone is a game-changer for anyone who needs multiple accounts on popular social media apps like WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook. It's easy to use and doesn't require you to jailbreak your device or install any third-party apps. Give it a try, and you'll see just how helpful it can be!

#### Method 2: Use Third Party iOS Applications
 
Note: We do not endorse any such apps that offer content from paid subscription services due to copyright infringement issues. So, use these services at your discretion.
 
Third-Party App Stores are online marketplaces that offer apps for iOS devices, in addition to the official App Store provided by Apple. These App Stores may offer apps that are not available in the official App Store, such as apps that have been rejected by Apple for various reasons, or apps that are only available in certain countries. Third-party App Stores may also offer modified versions of apps, known as cracked apps, which allow users to access paid features for free. Using these types of App Stores is generally considered to be a violation of Apple’s terms of service, and can also be a security risk, as the apps may have been modified to include malicious software or other vulnerabilities.
 
However, there are several apps that allow you to create a duplicate of an existing app on your device. These apps create a new, standalone version of the app that you can use alongside the original. Some popular duplication apps to install same app twice without Parallel Space on iPhone include:
 
- Dual Space Lite
 - 2Accounts – Dual Apps Space
 - Multi Parallel: Space Lite

 
Keep in mind that some duplication apps may require a premium version to unlock all features and that not all apps may be compatible with the duplication process.

Cydia is an app that allows users to install software packages on jailbroken iOS devices. It is another method to install same app twice without Parallel Space on iPhone.
 
A jailbroken device has been modified to allow the installation of apps that are unavailable in the App Store. Cydia acts as an alternative app store for these devices, providing a variety of apps, tweaks, and customization options. However, Cydia can only be used on jailbroken devices because it requires access to parts of the operating system that are restricted to non-jailbroken devices.
 
To install Cydia, you will need to jailbreak your iOS device by using specialized software on a computer to modify the device’s firmware. This process can be risky and may void your device’s warranty, so it is important to only use trusted jailbreak software. Here is a general overview of the process:
 
1. Download and install the Jailbreak software on your computer.
 
2. Connect your iPhone/iPad to the computer with a cable.
 
3. Follow the onscreen instructions to put your device into jailbreak mode.
 
Note: This may involve placing the device into recovery mode or DFU mode, depending on the jailbreak method you are using.
 
4. Run the jailbreak software and follow the onscreen instructions to jailbreak your device. This process may take several minutes to complete.
 
5. When the jailbreak process is finished, your device will be jailbroken. Install Cydia on the iOS device.
