# Say Goodbye To Yahoo Mail - Learn The Ultimate Hack to Migrate Your Emails and Contacts to Gmail Now!

Yahoo Mail has been a popular email service for many years, but it's no secret that the platform has experienced a decline in recent years. If you're still using Yahoo Mail and are considering switching to another email service, then you might want to consider Gmail, one of the most widely used and trusted email services out there. The process of migrating your emails and contacts from Yahoo Mail to Gmail can be a little daunting, but we’ve got you covered with the ultimate hack to do so. 

## Step-by-Step Guide to Migrate Your Emails and Contacts from Yahoo Mail to Gmail

### Step 1: Sign up for a new Gmail Account

If you don't already have a Gmail account, then you'll need to create one before you can start migrating your emails and contacts. Head to the Gmail homepage and click on the "Create Account" button. You will need to fill in all the required fields, including your first name, last name, and desired username. Once you’ve created your account, log in to your Gmail account.

### Step 2: Import Your Yahoo Mail Contacts into Gmail

In your Yahoo Mail account, click on the Contacts icon. When the contacts page opens, select the "Actions" drop-down menu, then select "Export." Choose the "Yahoo CSV" format for the exported file and save it to your computer. 

Next, go to your Gmail account and click on the "Mail" button at the top left corner of the page. Click on "Contacts" from the drop-down menu to open the contacts page. Select the "Import" button, which you'll see at the bottom of the page, then upload the CSV file you just saved from Yahoo Mail. Your contacts will now be imported to your Gmail account.

### Step 3: Adjust Your Gmail Settings

Before you start migrating your emails, make sure that your Gmail settings are correctly configured for the migration process. Go to the "Settings" icon on the top right corner of the Gmail inbox screen and choose "Settings" in the drop-down menu. Click on the "Accounts and Import" tab, then select "Import Mail and Contacts." Enter your Yahoo Mail login details, and Google will automatically prepare the import process.

### Step 4: Migrate Yahoo Mail Emails to Gmail

Now that your settings are adjusted, you can start migrating your emails. Head to the "Accounts and Import" tab in your Gmail settings and click on the "Import Mail and Contacts" button. A popup window will appear, prompting you to enter your Yahoo Mail login details again. Once you enter your information, you'll have the option to select which emails you want to import. If you want to import everything, leave the boxes checked, and click on the "Start Import" button.

Note that the time it takes for the import process to complete will depend on the number of emails you're importing. If you have a large number of emails, the process might take several hours.

### Step 5: Verify Your Migration

Once the migration process is complete, you'll need to verify that all your emails and contacts are correctly transferred to your Gmail account. Check both your inbox and outbox folders to see that all content has been moved. In case of missing data, re-do the process using the same steps.

## Conclusion

Migrating your emails and contacts from Yahoo Mail to Gmail might seem like a daunting task, but by following these simple steps, you can make the process seamless and stress-free. Not only can you migrate your data with ease, but Gmail is also a reliable and secure email service that offers many features you won't find in Yahoo Mail. Say goodbye to Yahoo Mail, and hello to Gmail, a more modern and efficient email service.
