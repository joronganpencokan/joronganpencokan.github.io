# Never Have Dirty Controllers Again: The Ultimate Guide to Keeping Your Gaming Gear Spotless!

Gaming consoles have revolutionized the way people enjoy video games. Whether you own a Playstation, Xbox, or Nintendo, you know how important it is to have clean and spotless controllers. Dirty controllers not only spoil the gaming experience but can also damage your equipment in the long run. If you are tired of having grimy and greasy controllers, read on for the ultimate guide on keeping your gaming gear spotless!

## Step 1: Get the Right Cleaning Tools

This may seem obvious, but not all cleaning products are created equal. Using the wrong cleaning agent can not only fail to take away dirt and oil but also damage the controller's surfaces. Avoid using bleaches, ammonia-based cleaners or anything containing alcohol, as they could cause the buttons to stick or cause the plastic to discolor or crack.

Instead, opt for safe and mild cleaning solutions recommended by the console manufacturer. Some of the recommended cleaning products include electronic wipes, microfiber cloths, or an all-purpose cleaner diluted with water.

## Step 2: Take your Controllers Apart

Disassembling your controllers gives you the chance to deep clean both the controller's contact points and the plastic casing separately. To do this, you’ll need a set of small screwdrivers that fit the controller's screws. While taking the controller apart, be sure to keep track of the screws and the parts you remove to avoid losing any small pieces. You can lay out the pieces on a clean surface such as a towel or a piece of cardboard.

## Step 3: Clean the Controller Parts

Now that you've disassembled your controllers, it's time to move on to cleaning the parts. The plastic casing and buttons can typically be cleaned using a damp cloth or a soft brush with warm water and soap. Be sure to dry them thoroughly before reassembling the controller.

Removing dirt and oil that has accumulated in the crevices of the controller can be tricky. Using a toothbrush dipped in alcohol or a cleaning solution can help clean the contact points where the controller's buttons meet the board. Be sure to remove any excess cleaning solution or water by dabbing it with a lint-free cloth.

## Step 4: Reassemble the Controller

Once you've cleaned the individual parts of the controller, put them back together carefully. Reattach the faceplate and buttons, making sure everything is in its correct place before proceeding. This step is much easier than it sounds and should only take a few minutes.

## Step 5: Storage and Maintenance

Keeping your controllers clean doesn't just end with cleaning them; you also need to maintain cleanliness regularly. Store your controllers in a clean and dry location where they are protected from dust and moisture. You can reduce dirt build-up by regularly wiping them down with a microfiber cloth. Also, avoid eating and drinking while playing or using the controller, as this can leave residues and cause damage.

In conclusion, cleaning your gaming equipment frequently ensures they last longer and enhances your gaming experience. Regular maintenance and proper storage of controllers will prevent dirt or moisture from causing unwanted glitches or sudden failure. The steps we have provided are simple yet effective ways to keep your controllers spotless and in excellent condition. Next time your controllers begin to feel grubby, use this guide to restore them to their former glory!

This article offers tips on cleaning your video game controllers, which tend to attract unsightly patches of grime and dirt.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Keep disinfecting wipes or hand sanitizing wipes near. Every once in a while, give your controllers a little scrub.You can clean the crease on the side of your controller with a small screwdriver or something similar.For PS2 and Xbox owners, consider using GlovesPlay Controller Covers. Also, wash your hands and ask your friends to wash theirs when playing.

 
##   What Causes the Dirt?  
 

We like to think that we are clean people, but no matter what we do, after a week of heavy use there is dirt on our controllers. It seems like it is caused by sweaty palms combining with the dust and dirt in the air (unless you have a HEPA air filter, you have dirt in your house) which forms some nasty looking gunk. It is usually located in a line around where we grip the controllers as well as on the triggers and shoulder buttons. Grime also collects in the crease where the two halves of the controller meet.

 
##   What Do You Do About It?  
 
- Have disinfecting wipes or hand sanitizing wipes around. You don't have to clean your controllers every day, but every once in a while give them a little scrub.You can clean the crease on the side of your controller with a small screwdriver or anything else that can get in there. You'll be surprised how much junk will come out.For PS2 and Xbox owners, we suggest using GlovesPlay Controller Covers, but they are very hard to find now. You can still get them for PS2 at Wal-Mart.com or eBay, but the Xbox version seems completely out of stock. The company that made them, TruGamerz, also seems to be out of business as their website hasn't been updated since September 2005. The GlovesPlay covers can absorb sweat and dirt and can be washed in a washing machine. If you can find them, get them.

 
- You could also ask your friends to wash their grubby mitts before they play with your controllers, but that would be rude. At the very least, follow step 1 after your gaming session is over, just to make sure.

 
##   Bottom Line  
 

These tips aren't really anything new or different, but if you haven't cleaned your controllers in a while you will be very surprised by how dirty they can get.

 
In 2015 these are basically impossible to find. There are vinyl covers you can put on your controllers, but they don't really do the same thing. A shame, too, because we really liked them (and still use them on our PS2 and OG Xbox).
 
Did you know that you can use your PS4 Controller to play PC games? You can.
