When I got my iPhone, I had to go to one of cafes in our place just to use their WiFi connection. I spent hours and hours of looking, downloading and installing Cydia apps. That’s really one of the biggest problems when you don’t have Internet connection at home. And one of the questions I’ve been asking my friends who also have iPhones is how to install Cydia apps even without WiFi connection.
 
Months later I learned that there is a way to install your favorite Cydia Apps in the absence of WiFi. I discovered that there is this little application called “Cyder” which serves as file manager for your iPhone and uses USB to transfer files to/from your iPhone. Cyder is for Windows only and it is free. Alright, here’s how to install those apps using this application
