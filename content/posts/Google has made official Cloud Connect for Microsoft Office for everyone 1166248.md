# Revolutionary Partnership: Google and Microsoft Finally Collaborate to Change the Way You Use Office!

In a move that few saw coming, tech giants Google and Microsoft have announced a partnership that aims to revolutionize the way people use Office. The collaboration will integrate Google Workspace and Microsoft Office, allowing users to seamlessly switch between the two platforms and access a range of new features and tools in the process.

The announcement comes as a surprise to many, given that Google and Microsoft have traditionally been fierce competitors in the office productivity space. Google Workspace, previously known as G Suite, has long been the go-to choice for businesses and teams looking for a cloud-based suite of productivity tools, while Microsoft Office has remained the desktop software of choice for many.

However, with the rise of remote work and the increasing need for collaboration, both companies have recognized the need to work together to provide users with a more seamless and integrated experience. The partnership means that users will be able to access the best of both worlds, leveraging the powerful cloud-based capabilities of Google Workspace and the familiar desktop environment of Microsoft Office.

So what can users expect from this revolutionary partnership? Here are some of the key features and benefits that will be available:

## Seamless Integration

One of the major benefits of this partnership is the seamless integration of Google Workspace and Microsoft Office. Users will be able to access both platforms from a single interface, without having to switch between different apps or sign in to different accounts. This means that productivity will be much faster and more efficient, as users can work on documents, spreadsheets, and presentations without interruptions.

## Enhanced Collaboration

Collaboration is key to modern-day productivity, and the partnership between Google and Microsoft aims to make it easier than ever. Users will be able to collaborate in real-time on documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, regardless of whether they are using Google Workspace or Microsoft Office. This means that teams can now collaborate seamlessly, regardless of their preferred platform.

## More Features and Tools

The partnership between Google and Microsoft will also bring a range of new features and tools to the table. For example, users will be able to use Google Meet directly from Microsoft Outlook, making it easier to schedule and join meetings. Similarly, Google Drive will be integrated directly into the Microsoft Office interface, making it easier to access and save files.

## Enhanced Mobility

Finally, this partnership will make it easier to work on the go. Users will be able to access both Google Workspace and Microsoft Office from their mobile devices, allowing them to work from anywhere at any time. This means that working remotely will be much more convenient and productive, as users can now seamlessly switch between their desktops and mobile devices without any friction.

In conclusion, the partnership between Google and Microsoft is a truly revolutionary move that will change the way we use Office forever. By integrating Google Workspace and Microsoft Office, users will be able to leverage the best of both worlds and access a range of new features and tools. This is great news for businesses, teams, and individuals alike, as it means that productivity will be faster, collaboration will be easier, and mobility will be enhanced. We can't wait to see what this partnership brings in the future!

Today Google made officially available for everyone the Cloud Connect plugin for Microsoft Office, which was only available for selected number of users back in November; now everybody can work and collaborate with other people in a much easier way. The Google Cloud Connect for Microsoft plugin is live now and you can easily get it here!
 
Cloud Connect is a free plugin from Google that will add a new toolbar at the top of the Office application and it will allow you to share and collaborate Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents with any person you choose by just sending an email with the unique link address that is given to the file, and can be accessed from anywhere, then the recipient can just click the link and open the Office document into Google Docs — as you can see, you don’t even need have Microsoft Office to collaborate –, at which point the person can also download the file and open it with the corresponding Office application.
 
The benefits using Cloud Connect are great, for example: When collaborating you shouldn’t worry about overlapping edits, because all the changes are kept, the only thing that you need to do if that happens, is to choose which change you want to keep in that particular section of the document. Documents that you modify are sync automatically to the cloud, they are always backed up and you can roll-back to previous version at any time. You can also work offline and the next time there is an available internet connection Cloud Connect will sync the file automatically. Another feature that is pretty handy is that if you need to show a document to someone but you don’t want that person to edit the file, you can easily send an View Only link.
 
The bottom line is that with Google Cloud Connect for Microsoft Office you are going to gain a lot of new features, you will be more productive, no more sending attachments back and forth or spending time trying to keep track which is the latest document version, no upgrades to your current software setup needed anymore, and best of all you won’t have to spend any money in new software. Cloud Connect works in Microsoft Office 2003, 2007 & 2010.
 
Here is a YouTube video showing how all this works.
