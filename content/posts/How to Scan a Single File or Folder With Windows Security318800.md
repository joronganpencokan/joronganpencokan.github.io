Many users believe that Windows security is not as reliable as the third-party security programs, but it’s a myth. Microsoft’s Windows Security application is pretty powerful and reliable as the third-party option. It can protect your computer from malware and viruses and provide your PC with a solid defense against rising ransomware attacks.
Other than that, Windows security offers additional features such as periodic scanning, controlled folder access, tamper protection, isolated browsing, and more. One feature of Windows security that often goes unnoticed is the ability to scan a single file or folder stored on the HDD/SSD.
If you suspect that a single file or a folder has a virus or malware, instead of scanning your entire system, you can force Windows Security to scan only the selected particular file/folder. Hence, if you are looking for ways to scan a single file or folder with Windows Security, you have landed on the right page.
