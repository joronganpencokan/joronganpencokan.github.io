Samsung has been at the forefront of cutting-edge TV technology, and its latest offering is no exception. The Samsung 85 inch 8K Smart TV is a game-changer in terms of picture quality, resolution, and features. The TV boasts four times more pixels than a conventional 4K TV, meaning you'll enjoy an incredibly sharp and detailed picture that's second to none.

But you're probably aware that owning an 85 inch 8K TV doesn't come cheap. With the average price at around $10,000, it's understandable why many people hesitate to take the plunge. But don't worry, there's a way to enjoy this high-end technology at a significantly lower price!

The secret lies in shopping smart. If you're savvy and know where to look, you can find great deals on the Samsung 85 inch 8K Smart TV that can save you thousands of dollars. Here are some tips to get you started:

## Shop Online

The first place to look when shopping for a TV is online. Online retailers don't have the overhead costs of traditional stores, which means they can offer lower prices on many products, including the Samsung 85 inch 8K Smart TV.

One of the best online retailers to shop for Samsung TVs is Amazon. With its vast inventory, competitive pricing, and free shipping, Amazon is a fantastic place to start. You can also check out other online retailers such as Best Buy, Walmart, and Newegg.

## Look for Sales

Another secret to saving on the Samsung 85 inch 8K Smart TV is to keep an eye out for sales. Retailers often offer promotions and sales during holidays, special events, and discount days. These sales can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

Make sure to sign up for retailers' email newsletters or follow them on social media to stay updated on upcoming sales. You can also check out deal websites such as Slickdeals and TechBargains, which will notify you of the biggest discounts on Samsung TVs.

## Consider Refurbished

Refurbished products are those that have been returned to the manufacturer, tested, and repaired if necessary. These products are often sold at a discounted price but still function as new.

Samsung offers certified refurbished products on its website, including the 85 inch 8K Smart TV. These products come with a one-year warranty and are backed by Samsung's quality assurance. You can also check out retailers such as Newegg and Best Buy for refurbished Samsung TVs.

## Final Thoughts

This 2022 85-inch QLED display comes with an Infinity Screen and an almost invisible bezel, and is imbued with Samsung's Quantum Matrix Technology Pro, a grid of specialized LEDs to display a billion colors with precision, improving colors and contrast. The tech giant has also implemented an AI-backed processor, managing 20 neural networks, to develop a display far more immersive than 4K builds.
Display sizes range from 65-inches to a massive 85-inches -- with prices to match. While an 85" television is likely overkill for many of us, and 4K is currently the typical resolution new smart TVs are offered with, 8K is the future of television. 8K TVs feature crisp, vibrant colors, clarity, and improved depth. While they are, indeed, expensive, with the upscaling millions of pixels offers, a purchase now will future-proof your viewing for years to come.Â 
This TV is arguably one of the best TVs on the market right now -- and was our top pick for our list of best 8K TVs. Not only did we take into account its surround-sound, room-filling Dolby Atmos software integration, but we also really liked the 144Hz refresh rate for gaming and streaming.
If this sounds like the TV for you, be sure to add it to your cart today. We can't guarantee that this sale will last for very long, as $2,000 in savings is a great deal for one of the best TVs out there right now.
