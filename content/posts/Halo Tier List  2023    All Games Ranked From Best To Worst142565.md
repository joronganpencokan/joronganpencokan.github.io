Unveiling the Ultimate Halo Tier List 2023: Find out which game reigns supreme and which one is an absolute trainwreck

The Halo franchise is a staple in the gaming industry, with its sci-fi universe and beloved characters. With each new release, fans have eagerly awaited the launch of the latest and greatest in the series. But with so many Halo games, it's tough to determine which ones are worth playing and which ones you should avoid like the Plague. Here, we present the ultimate Halo tier list, taking into account gameplay, graphics, storyline, and multiplayer.

S Tier: Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3

Let's just cut to the chase; the first three installments in the Halo series are S Tier. They define classic Halo gameplay and lay the foundation for the series. The original Halo: Combat Evolved was a revolutionary first-person shooter and still stands the test of time with its seamless blend of single-player and multiplayer modes. Halo 2's release marked the debut of online multiplayer, take your first step into matchmaking, and the introduction of the game's iconic dual-wielding system. Halo 3 brings the original trilogy to a satisfying close, and its multiplayer remains one of the highlights of the entire series.

A Tier: Halo: Reach, Halo 4

Halo: Reach takes place before the events of Halo: Combat Evolved, chronicling the story of Noble Squad. While it's not as revered as the original trilogy, its solid gameplay and improved graphics earned it a place in the A Tier. Halo 4 marks the beginning of a new trilogy, with 343 Industries taking the reins from Bungie to continue Master Chief's story. It's a strong entry with its graphics and polished gameplay, but it falls short in terms of storytelling and multiplayer.

B Tier: Halo Wars, Halo 5: Guardians

Halo Wars stepped away from the first-person shooter format to explore the world of real-time strategy games. It's a unique entry in the series, but its narrow gameplay limits its appeal. Halo 5: Guardians attempts to introduce new mechanics and a new plot, but it falls flat with lackluster storytelling and a confusing campaign. Its multiplayer has improved since launch, but it still feels like a letdown compared to previous entries in the series.

C Tier: Halo: Spartan Assault, Halo: Spartan Strike

Halo: Spartan Assault and Halo: Spartan Strike are mobile spin-offs of the series, and while they're enjoyable in short spurts, they don't hold a candle to the main entries. Their repetitive, simplistic gameplay makes them feel more like distractions than meaningful additions to the Halo universe.

D Tier: Halo: Fireteam Raven, Halo: Spartan Strike

Halo: Fireteam Raven is an arcade game that tries to capture the essence of the Halo experience, and it fails miserably. With its unresponsive controls and shallow gameplay, Fireteam Raven is just a bad game, plain and simple.

Final Thoughts

The Halo franchise has seen its share of highs and lows over the years, but at its core, it remains an integral part of gaming history. Classic titles like Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, and Halo 3 remain at the top of the heap, while newer entries like Halo 5: Guardians and Halo: Fireteam Raven fall far short. 

In conclusion, if you're looking for a quality Halo title, start with the original trilogy or Halo: Reach. If you're looking for something different, give Halo Wars a try. But if you're looking for a trainwreck, you might want to check out Halo: Fireteam Raven.


Halo games are generation-defining first-person shooters way before Call of Duty or Battlefield became the norm. Halo games shaped how we play and expect from FPS games to date. Many Xbox players like me have a close connection with these games and it’s usually a conversation starter when we meet another Xbox fan. But now with Halo Infinite multiplayer pursuing a free-to-play model, many new players are being introduced into the series and are able to experience the action and fluidity in the motions that these games offered and made better each generation of consoles. And many of these new players experiencing Master Chief for the first time through the paid single-player campaign are planning to play the old games. But with so many games including the original trilogy still available for grabs, many are confused about where to start. So, here’s my ranking of the best Halo games in this tier list.
 
## Halo Tier List – All Halo Games Ranked (2023)
 

 
Note that this ranking will be purely based on single-player campaigns of the game considering many factors. So with that in mind, here are all the best Halo Games Ranked in our Tier List:
 
The original trilogy is by far the best collection of games in the series and even though the anniversary versions give upgraded graphics with the push of a button, we ranked the OG games higher due to how close everyone here holds them to their heart. And top our list is the Halo MCC, which if a perfect pick who someone new to experience all the originals in order and in their glory. And rest of the games follows closely with the public opinions of the Redditors and our staff here. Halo Wars are also included in this list. And in the lowest end, we kept Halo Recruit and Halo Fireteam Raven. That’s because Halo Recruit requires a Windows MR headset to play and it doesn’t add much to the Halo experience. And Halo Fireteam Raven, being an arcade game, does not focus much on the story in the grand scheme of things.
 
So, that’s my ranking of all Halo games that have released till now. If you would like to check out more of our Tier Lists, be sure to explore the rankings section on Gamer Tweak.
