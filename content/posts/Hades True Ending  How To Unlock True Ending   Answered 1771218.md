Are you a fan of Hades? Have you beaten the game but feel like something is missing? Perhaps you've heard rumors of a secret ending that few have unlocked? Well, fear not because we're here to unveil Hades' true ending and show you how to unlock this ultimate conclusion now.

First, let's recap the story of Hades. The game follows Zagreus, the son of Hades, on his journey to escape the underworld and reach the surface world, all while fighting various enemies and bosses. Along the way, he discovers secrets about his family, friends, and the gods of Olympus.

But did you know there is a secret ending to the game? Unlike the normal ending, which sees Zagreus escaping to the surface world, the true ending offers a new level of depth to the game's narrative.

To unlock the true ending, you need to have beaten the game at least ten times, at which point you'll be given a new objective to complete.

Once this is done, you need to encounter a new NPC called "Hypnos." After talking to him, you will be given a new quest to complete. This quest requires you to collect a series of items called "Remnants," which are scattered throughout the game.

To collect these Remnants, you will need to revisit various boss fights and interact with objects in the environments. It can be challenging and will require a keen eye, but the reward is worth it.

After collecting all the Remnants, you need to return them to Hypnos, who will provide you with a new key. This key will unlock a new door located in the final area of the game.

Once you enter through the door, you will be faced with a challenging new environment and a series of daunting boss battles. But push through, and you'll be rewarded with Hades' true ending, which will offer you a whole new perspective on the game's story.

So what makes this ending so special? Well, without giving away the plot, we can say it adds significant depth to the game's narrative and offers resolutions to various plot threads left hanging in the standard ending.

Overall, unlocking Hades' true ending is no small feat, but for fans of the game, it's well worth the effort. Not only will it provide a satisfying conclusion to the story, but it will give you a new level of appreciation for the game's world and lore.

So, if you've beaten Hades multiple times and are hungry for more, go out and collect those Remnants, unlock that door, and discover the secret to unlocking the ultimate conclusion now!
