Title: Unleash Your Inner Ninja: Learn How to Craft Epic Weapons In Ninjala Now!

Are you ready to become an unstoppable ninja warrior in the world of Ninjala? It's time to learn how to craft epic weapons! With this guide, you will learn everything you need to know to create the ultimate tools of the ninja trade.

First, let's talk about the weapon crafting system in Ninjala. Unlike most fighting games, weapons in Ninjala aren't premade. Instead, players must craft their own weapons using "gum". Gum is a sticky and stretchy substance that can be found throughout the game. Players can collect it from balloons, enemies, and other sources.

Once you have a sufficient amount of gum, it's time to head to the weapon crafting section. Here, you have access to a variety of weapon shapes that you can use to create your own unique weapons. You will need to use your imagination to come up with the perfect weapon design for your play style.

There are several types of weapons to choose from, including hammers, yo-yos, swords, and drills. Each weapon has its own unique properties, so it's essential to experiment with different shapes and gum colors to find the right combination for you.

The next step in crafting your epic weapon is to add a "gum shoot". This is a special attack that can be used in battle. Gum shoots come in a variety of different types, including stunning, trapping, and healing. Again, it's essential to experiment with different gum shoots to find the right combination for your weapon.

Once you have created your weapon, it's time to take it to battle! Ninjala features various game modes, including battle royale and team battles. Whether you prefer playing solo or with friends, there is a game mode for you.

In conclusion, crafting epic weapons in Ninjala is an essential part of becoming a ninja warrior. With the right combination of gum, weapon shapes, and gum shoots, you can create a weapon that suits your play style perfectly. So what are you waiting for? It's time to unleash your inner ninja and create the ultimate weapon!

Ninjala is all about some intense melee based combat and the right use of bubble gum. The Ninjas in this game like to keep things fun and wacky and that’s what makes Ninjala stand out. Of course, weapons are one of the most important things in this game and Ninjala gives you the ability to craft them. Let’s take a look at the weapon types and how to craft weapons in Ninjala.
 
## How to Get Big Weapons in Ninjala
 
There are different classes of gum weapons including Katana blades, Hammer and Yo-yo. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages. The yo-yo is good for attacking from a distance and to get some sneaky movements, the Katana is ideal for mobility and rushing power and the Hammer is most effective for countering special moves.
 
To craft weapons in Ninjala, you have to blow bubbles with Ninja-Gum. Keep an eye on your S-Energy (Shinobi Energy) gauge because if it is at level 8 or even higher, you can craft big weapons. With them, you will get an advantage in the game because they provide high damage. That’s not all – you will get higher scores and this will also let you use their secondary ability. This is crucial because getting the highest scores is your ultimate goal in Ninjala.
 
Another great thing about big weapons is that if you have one in a Parry situation, you can easily defeat your opponent. Take a look at our guide on how to Parry in Ninjala for more in-depth information on the Parry system.
 
Remember that destroying drones will enhance your S-energy gauge. More S-energy will make your gum grow stronger which will in turn enable you to craft bigger weapons, as we mentioned before. This shows that defeating the Drones is very essential, so make sure to do that at any chance you get.
 
To blow a gum bubble you will need to press the ZL button. After that, when you press the A button, you will be able to craft a weapon. Note that gum weapons aren’t unbreakable, so if your weapon breaks, you need to craft another one.
 
This is basically everything on how to craft weapons in Ninjala. Keep reading our other Ninjala guides to stay ahead of others.
