Are you tired of losing every game you play online? Have you tried every possible trick to improve your gaming skills, but nothing seems to work? Don't worry, we have the ultimate secret that can instantly boost your gaming skills.

The secret lies in understanding and minimizing network latency, the delay between your game's servers and your device. Latency can affect your gaming experience in several ways, including slower reaction time, connection drops, and lag.

Here's how you can use network latency to your advantage and instantly boost your gaming skills.

Choose a Fast and Stable Internet Connection

The first step to minimizing network latency is to have a fast and stable internet connection. Make sure you have a reliable internet service provider that offers high-speed internet with low-latency rates.

Another crucial factor is to use a wired connection. Wi-fi may be convenient, but it is not the most reliable connection for real-time online games. A wired connection provides a more stable and faster connection with lower latency rates.

Use a Gaming VPN

A Gaming VPN, such as ExitLag, is the ultimate solution to reduce network latency. This software optimizes your internet connection by finding the shortest path between your device and the game server.

ExitLag examines the route that your data travels on the internet and finds the fastest path for it to reach the game server. This reduces the number of hops between your device and the server, reducing latency and improving your gaming experience.

Configure Your Game Settings

Another way to improve your gaming experience and reduce latency is to optimize your game settings. Adjusting your graphics and audio settings can significantly reduce the data your device has to transfer to the server, reducing latency.

Lowering your in-game settings can reduce the load on your network infrastructure and free up bandwidth. This reduction in data usage helps decrease latency and can give you an edge in real-time games.

Conclusion

In conclusion, network latency is a critical factor when it comes to online gaming performance. A low-latency connection is the key to faster reaction times, reduced lag, and fewer connection drops. By following the tips above and using a gaming VPN, you can reduce network latency and instantly boost your gaming skills, giving you an edge over your opponents.

Latency, in the simplest terms, is the delay between sending a message and receiving the message. We measure the latency of a first-class letter in days. We measure the latency of internet packets in thousandths of a second, or milliseconds. Some latency is impossible to avoid: if nothing else limits latency, the speed of light represents a final speed limit. While we can never eliminate latency completely, we can often improve network latency with the methods mentioned below.
 
Latency is introduced through the hardware used to transmit packets, the software used to direct those packets, and the destination receiving the packets. Network issues like packet loss, overwhelmed hardware, or insufficient bandwidth will also increase latency.
 
## How to Reduce Latency
 
The first and best way to avoid latency is to work with a reliable internet service provider. Your ISP sets the minimum latency you can achieve. Even if you remove every microsecond of latency from your home network, you won’t be able to communicate with external servers any faster than your ISP’s hardware can communicate. So, if you absolutely must have the lowest ping and the fastest communication time, work with an ISP that will make your connection’s speed their priority. However, in many countries around the world — the United States first among them, you’re stuck with whatever your city’s dated communication infrastructure can provide, regardless of what you’re willing to pay.
 
But if you’re having latency issues, they’re likely compounded by your home network setup. To reduce latency on your home network, there’s a variety of best practices you’ll want to follow.
 
## 1. Use Ethernet
 
Just like cable internet is faster than satellite internet, ethernet is faster than Wi-Fi. The current optimal standard is Cat-6e. For low latency, your first choice should always be cabled connections, even when difficult or inconvenient. If it’s truly impossible to use a wired connection, get closer to the router. Remove or evade any obstacles between the computer and the router’s antennas. If you can see the router’s antennas from your computer’s antennas, you’re good. Position external Wi-Fi antennas perpendicularly for the best transmission.
 
## 2. Avoid Interference
 
Objects between your computer and your router can degrade the signal dramatically, which is why we remove them. But invisible electronic interference can also play its part, especially on the crowded 2.4 GHz band. Provided you’re well positioned, it’s better to use the less-popular 5 GHz band. You’ll also want to choose the emptiest Wi-Fi channel you can find in your router’s configuration settings, which will vary depending on the settings of nearby routers.
 
## 3. Limit Network Traffic
 
Imagine you’re at a crowded party. Everyone is talking, laughing, having a good time. The environment is great, but it’s hard to have a long discussion. Why? All the overlapping conversations make it harder to hear the conversation. The same analogy applies to home networks. The more devices communicating simultaneously — the more people talking at once — the harder it is to get your message through correctly. Reduce communication by other devices as much as possible. While you can kick devices off your network, most routers provide Quality of Services (QoS) tools that you can apply to limit communication overlap based on device and application. For example, you might set a QoS rule that always gives your gaming desktop maximum speed, reducing the speed allocated to other devices if necessary.
 
## 4. Appropriate Bandwidth & Hardware
 
A low-latency network needs high quality hardware. Most consumer routers won’t get you the greatest latency numbers, but the more expensive models perform well. If you want the absolutely lowest home network latency, you’ll need to use commercial switching and routing hardware. Make sure you’re getting hardware that provides the newest connectivity standard supported by your devices.
 
Your router and internet connection also need to provide the appropriate bandwidth for your use case. If you have three kids all streaming YouTube simultaneously while you try to play Overwatch on a 25 Mbps connection, you’re gonna have a bad time. Pay for the highest speed you can reasonably afford. When packets don’t need to wait for available bandwidth to leave your network, your latency will drop significantly.
 
## 5. Eliminate Proxies and VPNs
 
The single longest step in any communications process is the time it takes for the signal to travel between nodes over cables. The more nodes you send the message to, the longer the trip will take. This is true even if the nodes are in the same room. While the latency is lower, the time it takes to “bounce” a message from one node to another is somewhat irreducible. To remove this delay, you need to remove the intervening nodes. Remove any proxies or VPNs in your communications chain.
 
The above tips should help you improve the network latency and improve your gaming experience. What other tips have we missed out?
