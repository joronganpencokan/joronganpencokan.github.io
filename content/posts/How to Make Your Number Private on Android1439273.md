If so, then you have come to the right place as we reveal the secret to total privacy on your Android device. Continue reading to learn how to make your number private and safeguard your privacy like a pro.

## The Risks of Sharing Your Mobile Number

Sharing your mobile number leaves you vulnerable to various risks, such as identity theft, data breaches, and other malicious activities. Hackers and scammers can use your mobile number to gain access to your personal information, bank accounts, and social media profiles. They can also use your number for impersonation and social engineering attacks, making you a prime target for fraud and cybercrime.

Moreover, third-party companies and service providers often collect and sell your mobile number and contact information to marketers, advertisers, and other data brokers without your explicit consent. This exposes you to unwanted advertising, sales pitches, and unsolicited calls and messages that can disrupt your personal and professional life.

## Why You Need to Make Your Number Private

Making your number private helps you protect your privacy, prevent unsolicited calls and messages, and avoid any potential scams or frauds. It also helps you maintain a professional image and control who and when someone can reach you. Here are some of the main reasons why you need to make your number private:

- **Say goodbye to spam calls and messages:** By hiding your number, you can avoid telemarketers, robocalls, and other automated messages that waste your time and energy.

- **Protect yourself from identity theft:** Concealing your number makes it harder for hackers, scammers, and other cybercriminals to steal your personal information or use it for illegitimate purposes.

- **Keep your personal contacts confidential:** You don't want everyone to know who you talk to, especially if you have some sensitive or confidential discussions with your family, friends, or business partners.

### Method 1: Use Your Phone Settings

5. Tap on the edit button and delete the number.
6. Reboot your phone and check if the number is hidden.

2. Tap on the keypad icon to reveal the dialer.
3. Enter the code #31# followed by the phone number you want to call.
4. Press the call button, and your number will be hidden from the recipient's phone.
5. Note that this only applies to the current call and does not hide your number for future calls.

### Method 3: Contact Your Carrier

1. Call or visit your mobile carrier's customer service.
2. Ask them to enable the "Caller ID Blocking" or "Anonymous Call Rejection" feature for your number.
3. Follow the instructions to activate the feature on your phone.

This article walks you through a few different ways to make your number private so that when you call someone, your phone number isn't displayed on their caller ID.

 
### 
What to know
 
- You can always use *67 to block your number, but there are other ways.Most carriers have a Hide Number setting you can enable in their app.If all else fails, call your carrier and ask them to hide your number.

 
##   A Quick No Caller ID Trick: *67  
 

One of the quickest and easiest ways to hide your number from the person you're calling is to use the *67 trick when you're dialing. That will make your number register as 'Private' to the person you call. You'll have to do it for every call you want to make with a hidden number, but if you only need to hide your number now and then, this is a good option for keeping your number private.

 
##   Use the Hide Number No Caller ID Trick  
 

Almost all Android devices on most mobile carriers offer the option of hiding your number by default, making it unnecessary to input *67 every time you call. Here's how to block your cell phone number using your phone's built-in Hide Number feature.

 
- Select the Phone (or Telephone) icon in your app menu or at the bottom of your device's home screen.
 - Select the three-dot menu icon in the top-right of the window.
 - Select Settings.
 - Select Calls.
 - Select Additional settings (It could also be Supplementary settings).
 - When it's finished loading, select Caller ID.
 - Select Hide Number from the pop-up menu.

 

This no caller ID trick will make it so that your number never shows up when you ring someone. Instead, it will display as Blocked, Private, or No Caller ID. If you want your number to display again temporarily, you can preface the number you're calling with *82. Alternatively, if you want to turn off your number block, repeat the steps above, and at the last one, select Network Default or ShowNumber.

 
If you don't have the option to Hide Number after following the steps below, it's possible your carrier or device doesn't support it.
 

Select the Phone (or Telephone) icon in your app menu or at the bottom of your device's home screen.

 

Select the three-dot menu icon in the top-right of the window.

 

Select Settings.

 

Select Calls.

 

Select Additional settings (It could also be Supplementary settings).

 

When it's finished loading, select Caller ID.

 

Select Hide Number from the pop-up menu.

 
###   Ask Your Carrier To Block Your Number Directly  
 

If your device doesn't have the option to block your number directly, then you may need to ask your carrier to do it for you. Sometimes this can be completed with the official application.

 
- Verizon App: Instructions for how to block your cell phone number on Verizon.
 - AT&T App: Details on how to make your number unknown on AT&T.
 - Sprint App: A guide on how to call someone without showing your number on Sprint.
 - T-Mobile App: Information on how to call someone anonymously on T-Mobile.

 

If the above call blocking services don't support your device within the official apps, try contacting your carrier directly. They can usually block your ID for you.

 
###   Use a Burner Number  
 

If none of the above no caller ID tricks work, you can buy a prepaid phone, often referred to as a burner or disposable number. Many paid-for services let you route your calls, texts, and picture messages through a temporary number.

 
##   Limitations to Hiding Your Phone Number  
 

There are some calls that you can't hide your number from. Toll-free services and 911 emergency services will always be able to see your number, whatever you do. Some third-party applications can allow someone to get around any number obfuscation you put in place, so none of these methods are guaranteed.
