# Unlock the Hidden Power of Windows 10 - Learn How to Create A Guest User Account in Just a Few Simple Steps!

Have you ever needed to share your computer with someone else, but were hesitant to let them use your personal account? Or perhaps you have children who need access to certain programs but you don't want them to have access to your entire computer? Fear not, because Windows 10 has a solution for you - guest user accounts!

A guest user account is a temporary account with limited access to your computer. It allows someone to use your computer without having full access to your personal files, settings, and programs. Here are the steps to create your own guest user account:

1. Go to the Start menu and click on the Settings icon.
2. Click on Accounts.
3. Under Family & other users, click on Add someone else to this PC.
4. Click on I don't have this person's sign-in information.
5. Click on Add a user without a Microsoft account.
6. Enter a name for the account, such as "guest."
7. Choose a password for the account if desired (this is not required).
8. Click on Next.

That's it! You now have a guest user account on your computer. To switch to the guest account, simply click on the Start menu, click on your account name, and select the guest account. Here are some things to keep in mind when using a guest account:

- The guest account does not have access to your personal files or settings.
- The guest account cannot install new software or make any changes to the system.
- Any changes the guest account makes to the computer will be erased when they log out.

Using a guest account is a great way to keep your personal information safe while still allowing others to use your computer. It's also a handy feature for parents who want to give their children limited access to the computer. And best of all, it's easy to set up and use!

In conclusion, creating a guest user account is a simple way to unlock the hidden power of Windows 10. It's a great tool for sharing your computer with others without compromising your personal information. So don't be afraid to try it out - you might just love the convenience it provides!

The user accounts feature in Windows allows you to create multiple accounts for different users on your system. These accounts let you control what those users can and cannot do while still letting them have their own settings. Broadly, Windows has three different types of accounts: Administrator account that let you do almost anything, Standard account that has no admin privileges, and Guest account which is well below the standard user account with even more restrictions.
 
The guest account is very useful when you want to temporarily lend your system to others. Due to the restrictions placed on this account, the user won’t be able to install/uninstall any applications or be able to make significant changes to the system.
 
As good as it is, the default guest account in Windows 10 is completely disabled, and you cannot turn it on like you can in Windows 7. Moreover, Windows won’t allow you to create a guest account as you would a standard account. However, here is how you can create your own guest user account in Windows 10 by converting a current local standard user account to a guest account.
 
## Create Guest User Account in Windows 10
 
Creating a guest user account in Windows 10 isn’t hard – you just need to hop around some settings. That is, you first need to create a standard user account and then change it into a guest account.
 
To start, search for “User Accounts” in the Start menu and open it.
 

 
The above action will take you to your user account page. Click on the link “Manage another account.”
 
In the window you will see all the accounts on your system. To create a new account, click on the link “Add a user account” appearing at the bottom of the window.
 
If you are connected to the Internet, Windows 10 will ask you to create a new user account with a Microsoft account. Since we just want to create a guest account, click on the link “Sign in without a Microsoft account” appearing at the bottom of the window.
 
Now, Windows will tell you the difference between a local account and the Microsoft account. Just click on the button “Local account” to continue.
 
Here, enter the guest account username, password, and password hint, and then click on the “Next” button. Do note that you cannot use the username “guest,” as it is reserved for the system. So, in my case, I’m using “temp” as my username.
 
That’s it, you’ve created a standard user account. Click on the “Finish” button to close the wizard.
 
Now we need to convert this account to the guest account. To do that, press “Win + R,” type netplwiz and press the Enter button.
 
The above action will open the Advanced User Account window. Here, select the newly created user from the list under “Users for this computer” section, and then click on the “Properties” button.
 
In the user account properties window, select the account type as “Other,” and then select the user group as “Guest” from the drop-down menu. Once you are done, click on the “OK” button to save the changes.
 
That’s all there is to do. You’ve successfully created your own guest user account. In fact, if you open the User Accounts from the start menu, you will see the reflected changes.
 
When you want to lend your system to someone, just share the password, and you are good to go. Since you are the one who has created the account, you can easily delete the account. To do that, click on the account in the User Accounts window and then click on the “Delete Account” button.
