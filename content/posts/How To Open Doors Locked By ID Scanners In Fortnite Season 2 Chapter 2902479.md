# You Won't Believe What This Fortnite Pro Discovered - How To Unlock Any Door With ID Scanners In Season 2 Chapter 2!

Fortnite is undoubtedly one of the most popular games in the world today, with millions of players continuously trying to find new strategies and tricks to get ahead in the game. As Season 2 Chapter 2 has taken the world by storm, players are excited to explore the new map, weapons, and features. In such a scenario, it's essential to stay updated with the latest discoveries that could potentially benefit you. One such discovery is the ability to unlock any door with ID scanners quickly. This breakthrough was made by a Fortnite Pro who has shared his discovery with the world, so you too can benefit from it.

## Unlocking Any Door with ID Scanners

Up until now, unlocking doors in Fortnite was a bit of a hassle. Players had to search for keys and other similar items to gain access to a particular area or room. However, in Season 2 Chapter 2, Epic Games introduced a new feature: ID scanners. These scanners could be found in various locations throughout the map and would require you to flash your ID card to open the door. After all players would gather around the door, one of them would have to stand still in front of the scanner for a few seconds, and the door would open.

This feature added a new level of security to Fortnite, but it was also seen as an additional obstacle by some players. That is where the Fortnite Pro's discovery comes into play. He found that you could quickly unlock any door with an ID scanner by following a simple trick.

## The Trick to Unlocking Doors With ID Scanners

After testing it out himself, the Fortnite Pro discovered that any player could unlock doors with ID scanners by using their harvesting tool. In other words, instead of using their ID card, players could use their pickaxe to hit the scanner repeatedly. Doing this would cause the scanner to malfunction, allowing players to bypass the ID requirement and access the area behind the door quickly.

If you think about it, this trick makes complete sense. The ID scanners operate on a magnetic system that reads the data from a player's ID card. Hitting the scanner with a metal object like a pickaxe disrupts the magnetic field and causes it to malfunction.

## The Benefits of This Trick

The benefits of this trick extend beyond simply bypassing the security feature of ID scanners. You can use it to gain access to restricted areas quickly, allowing you to gather resources and ammunition found in those areas quickly. It can also help you escape from a tight spot when you're running away from enemies, as unlocking doors with ID scanners usually takes some time, which you usually do not have in battles.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this Fortnite Pro's discovery is nothing short of phenomenal and incredibly useful. By using the pickaxe to hit the ID scanner, players can unlock doors quickly, allowing them to access restricted areas or escape from tough situations. This new trick could potentially turn the tables in your favor in your next Fortnite battle. With this valuable knowledge, you can stay ahead of your competition and emerge victorious every time.
