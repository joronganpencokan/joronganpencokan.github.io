Unlock Insane Strategies to Boost Your Card Catalog in Lost Ark - Start Dominating Today!

Lost Ark is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that has been attracting millions of players globally since its launch in 2018. Among the game’s features is a unique card system that players collect and use to upgrade their character.

The card system is a crucial aspect of the game, and having a comprehensive card catalog will significantly boost your character's abilities, making them more powerful. To help you improve your card catalog, here are some insane strategies that you can implement to start dominating today!

1. Discover Rare Cards

One of the significant aspects of the card system is discovering rare cards that come with various bonuses that can significantly improve your character's statistics. To discover rare cards, you can complete daily and weekly quests, participate in raids and dungeon runs, and explore new areas in the game. 

These cards will provide unique abilities to your character, enabling you to conquer even the strongest opponents. So keep exploring and keep an eye out for rare cards to add to your catalog.

2. Combine Cards

You can combine cards of the same rarity and level to create a more powerful card. The new card will inherit both the attributes of the original cards, resulting in a stronger card with impressive abilities. 

Ensure that the cards you combine are complementary and work well together, ensuring that the new card created is beneficial to your character. By combining cards, you can create unique card sets that provide your character with an array of bonuses, making them a formidable opponent.

3. Upgrade Your Cards

Upgrading your cards is another strategy that can boost your card catalog. To upgrade your cards, you will require resources that you can collect by completing quests, participating in raids, and opening treasure chests. 

When upgrading your cards, make sure to prioritize essential cards like those that provide bonuses to your character's stats. Upgrading cards will enhance the card's abilities, making them more powerful and beneficial to your character.

4. Trade Cards

Trading cards with other players is another effective strategy that can help improve your card catalog. You can trade cards with other players that have cards that you need for your card sets. 

Before trading, make sure to negotiate the best deal possible to ensure that you’re not losing out on the trade. Trading can also help you discover new cards that you didn't previously know existed, giving you the chance to add them to your catalog.

In conclusion, having a comprehensive card catalog is crucial to succeeding in Lost Ark. These strategies will help you acquire rare cards, combine them to create stronger cards, upgrade them, trade them, and ultimately create a powerful card set to dominate in the game. Start implementing them today and watch your character become unstoppable!

Lost Ark is one of the best recent top-down fantasy massively multiplayer online action role-playing games on Steam and a trending game among gamers. It was the second most played game within twenty-four hours after its release. Lost Ark game mechanics have the potential to rival quite a few other games in this genre. The game has impressed players in its ability to keep them engaged with multiple items and resources to unlock. While you upgrade your character skills, there are quite a lot of things you must do. A Card Catalog is something that helps with skill upgrades in a character. Since there is a limit of 120 in the Card Catalog in Lost Ark, this guide will show you how to increase it.
 
## How to Increase Card Catalog in Lost Ark
 

 
Card Catalog is something that players often miss when upgrading skills. A deck of six cards is used with the character to get small special effects. Although there is a cap of 120 at the start, players can increase the size of the Card Catalog in the game. Here’s what you need to do:
 
- Open your Cards tab by pressing Alt + C.
 - On the top-left of the screen, navigate to the Enhance tab.
 - Once the tab is open, scroll down to Expand Catalog Slots section.
 - As you click it you will get a pop-up window from which you can purchase the Card Catalog for 30 Crystals.

 
While this does increase the capacity by ten more cards, you can always purchase more if this falls short. Additionally, if you need space but cannot purchase more slots, you can always delete cards that you do not use. The option is located right next to the card search option.
 
That’s all you need from this guide on how to increase card catalog in Lost Ark. While you are here, make sure you check out our other Lost Ark guides, tips, and tricks with Gamer Tweak.
