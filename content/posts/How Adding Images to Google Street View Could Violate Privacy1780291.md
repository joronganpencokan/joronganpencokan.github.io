Introduction

Google Street View is a feature of Google Maps that allows users to explore and navigate various cities and roads around the world in a virtual environment. While this feature has undoubtedly revolutionized the way people access and explore information about different parts of the world, there have been concerns about its impact on people's privacy. In recent years, experts have warned that adding further images to Google Street View could be the final straw that crosses the line in terms of invading people's privacy. In this article, we will explore the issue of Google Street View and its impact on privacy.

What is Google Street View?

Google Street View is an online platform that allows users to view a three-dimensional, panoramic image of streets, landscapes, and buildings across the world. It was launched in May 2007 and has since covered more than 10 million miles of roads in over 85 countries. The images captured by Google Street View cars that are equipped with 360-degree cameras are uploaded to Google Maps, where users can explore different parts of the world from the comfort of their homes.

The Positive Aspects of Google Street View

Google Street View has several positive aspects. Firstly, it enables people to explore different parts of the world without leaving their homes. This is particularly useful for people who are unable to travel due to various reasons such as disabilities, financial constraints, or travel restrictions. Secondly, Google Street View is an excellent tool for research and education. It can be used to study streets, buildings, landmarks, and other features of different parts of the world. It can also be used to explore geographic areas and landscapes, which can be beneficial for students and researchers.

The Negative Impact of Google Street View on Privacy

Despite the many benefits of Google Street View, there have been concerns about its impact on privacy. Google Street View images capture the streets, buildings, vehicles, and people that are visible from public roads. However, some people argue that it goes beyond what is reasonable and invades people's privacy. For example, Google Street View images have captured people in private moments, such as coming out of their homes, sunbathing, or engaging in other private activities. This has caused concern among people who value their privacy.

In addition, some people argue that Google Street View images can be used for nefarious purposes by criminals, stalkers, or other individuals with malicious intent. The images can be used to plan burglaries, stalk people, or engage in other criminal activities. Moreover, Google Street View can also be used to conduct surveillance of public areas, which may be a violation of civil liberties.

Experts Warn that Adding More Images to Google Street View Could be the Final Straw

In recent years, experts have warned that adding further images to Google Street View could be the final straw that crosses the line in terms of invading people's privacy. Google has already received several complaints and lawsuits related to privacy violations stemming from Google Street View. Adding more images to the platform could further exacerbate these issues and could lead to more legal challenges.

Conclusion

Google Street View is an innovative tool that has transformed the way people access information about different parts of the world. However, people's privacy must be protected at all times. While Google Street View has many positive aspects, it also has the potential to invade people's privacy. Experts have warned that adding further images to the platform could be the final straw that crosses the line. It is essential that Google takes the necessary measures to protect people's privacy while continuing to offer valuable information and services through Google Street View.

Google now lets you take your own photos and upload them to Street View, either filling in the gaps in Google’s photographic mosaic of the world, or updating old pictures. 

 
### 
Key Takeaways
 
- Android users can use augmented reality to upload images from the Street View app.Not all countries love Street View—some places have banned it, others have censored it.Street View currently has 170 billion images covering 10 million miles.

 

Using the updated Street View app on an Android phone, you can just hold up your phone, walk down a street, and take photos. Behind the scenes, Google uses augmented reality, and the positioning data from your phone, to automatically line up all the images with the existing Street View images. 

 

"Now that anyone can create their own connected Street View photos, we can bring better maps to more people around the world, capturing places that aren’t on Google Maps or that have seen rapid change," writes Stafford Marquardt, a Street View product manager. "All you need is a smartphone—no fancy equipment required."

 
##   Wait, There Are Places Not On Google Maps?  
 

In a world where you can climb Yosemite’s El Capitan on Street View, it seems that the only places not covered by Google’s all-encompassing photo project would be ultra-remote, uninhabited territories. But sometimes the locals just don’t want it. The English Channel island of Guernsey, an English-speaking territory off the coast of France, refuses to let Street View go live. Back in 2010 and '11, locals vandalized Google’s Street View camera cars, and local authorities ended up blocking publication. To this day, there is no Street View in the island.

 

"It’s a question of culture," Peter Harris, the former data protection commissioner of Guernsey, told the BBC at the time. "I mean Google comes from the USA where perhaps views on privacy are different from those in Western Europe."

 

Last year, Apple arrived in the Bailiwick with plans to record its own Look Around footage, but that hasn’t appeared yet, either. 

 

Germany has also objected to ubiquitous Street View, although in a typically pragmatic way. While most of the country is covered, many properties are blurred. This gives people the utility of Street View, while affording privacy to those who want it. It’s kind of like delisting your number from the phone book.

 
##   Business Bonus  
 

Businesses stand to benefit from these new Street View tools. You could generate your own walk through of your property, for example, and "connect" them to the existing street view of your building’s frontage.

 

When people upload their own Street View imagery, it will be shown as an alternative to the official imagery. However, if it is added in a place that doesn’t yet have any official Google pictures, it will appear on the map as a dotted blue line, and can be viewed like official solid-line imagery. 

 

It’s possible that individuals could try to circumvent the blocks put on Street View by local authorities, but that should be easy to take care of. Crowdsourcing Android phone users, though, could also prove quite powerful, bringing street-level imagery to places that may never otherwise be visited by Street View. And that could be a big deal.
