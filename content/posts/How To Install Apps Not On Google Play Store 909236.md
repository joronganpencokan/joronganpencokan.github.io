# SECRET METHOD REVEALED: Install Apps BANNED from Google Play Store in JUST 3 STEPS!

Are you tired of not being able to access certain apps on the Google Play Store? Are you frustrated with the limitations placed on you by Google's policies? Well, worry no more! We have a secret method that will allow you to install apps that are banned from the Google Play Store in just three easy steps!

Before we reveal the method, it's important to note that not all banned apps are safe or legal. Therefore, we advise that you only install apps that are reputable and have been vetted by experts. With that said, let's reveal the secret method!

## Step 1: Download the APK File

The first step is to download the APK file for the app that you want to install. APK stands for Android Package Kit and is the file format used by Android to distribute and install apps. You can download the APK file from a variety of sources online, but we advise that you only download from trusted sources to avoid any malware or virus infections.

## Step 2: Enable Unknown Sources

After you have downloaded the APK file, you need to enable the "Unknown Sources" option on your device. This option allows you to install apps from sources other than the Google Play Store. To enable this option, go to your device's "Security" settings and toggle on the "Unknown Sources" option.

## Step 3: Install the App

The final step is to install the app by opening the APK file and following the installation prompts. You may be prompted to grant permissions to the app, and you should only grant permissions that you feel comfortable with. After the installation is complete, you can locate the app in your device's app drawer and start using it!

With these three easy steps, you can now access apps that are banned from the Google Play Store. However, it's important to note that there are risks involved with installing apps from unknown sources. These risks include security vulnerabilities, malware infections, and potential harm to your device. Therefore, we advise that you only install apps from sources that you trust and have been vetted by experts.

In conclusion, the secret method to install apps banned from the Google Play Store in just three easy steps is to download the APK file, enable the "Unknown Sources" option, and install the app. But remember to only install apps from trusted sources to avoid any potential risks. Happy app hunting!

But if you are sure that the app is safe then you can allow their installation if desired after changing just one setting.
 
As of now, there are new versions of Android OS available in the market, but unfortunately, not all devices have the same Android. And the option to change this setting for installing apps from other sources also differs accordingly. Till Android 7.0 Nougat it is the same, but after that from Android 8.0, it has changed a little bit.

 - Now from here select Special access and after that in the menu list select Install unknown apps.

 
2. Both of the above steps will take you to the same menu. Once inside it, you will see a list of apps and the status Allowed or Not Allowed below them. Tap on the app or source from which you are downloading and wish to install the apps, not in Play Store.
 
- Now from here select Special access and after that in the menu list select Install unknown apps.

 

 
Then turn the toggle switch On in front of Allow from this source. Now you can go back and try to install the app.
 
Alternatively, if you have not enabled Unknown Source using the above methods, your device will automatically give you an alert on all the version of Android as shown below when you try to install an app unavailable in Play Store. Apps from third-party websites and unknown Sources are blocked by default for better security. But you can change it if desired.
