Recently Microsoft published another public beta of Windows 10 Mobile. Unlike the first release, the new build of Windows 10 for mobile devices supports a wider range of Lumia devices, which means that many people will try to get their hands on the new bits.
 
However, users should be aware that like any beta software, the second build of Windows 10 Mobile has a number of bugs and lot features don’t work. As such, if you are OK taking the risk and you like to troubleshoot issues, then you are a perfect candidate to install the new preview for phones.
 
## How to install new Windows 10 Mobile previews
 
- In order to install Windows 10 Mobile, you first need to make sure your handset is a supported device.
 - Now make sure your device is running the latest version of Windows Phone 8.1. On your phone, go to Settings > About > Info.
 - Once you check the version number, register as a Windows Insider, if you haven’t done it already.
 - Download and install the Windows Insider app in your device from the Windows Phone Store.
 - Launch the Windows Insider app, tap “Get preview builds”, sign-in with your Microsoft account that you used to register as an Insider.
 - Now, it’s the time to enroll your device. Here, you have two options: the Insider Slow will get you the pre-release build of Windows 10 that is more stable, or you can enroll your device in the Insider Fast, which will get you the latest preview of Windows 10 for phones, but it will include more bugs and fewer workarounds.
 - Tap Accept to confirm your enrollment, by accepting the term that you’re aware you may be voiding your warranty and that data may get lost.
 - Once the app closes automatically, go to Settings, navigate through phone update, and tap check for updates.
 - After a few moments, the new build of Windows 10 for mobile devices should start downloading.
 - Now depending on your device, this process may take some time. It can take 10 minutes to 2 hours, so don’t worry if things begin to take a long time. After the bits have downloaded successfully, you’ll be prompted to click Install to get the new build installed in your Windows Phone. Then the next time your phone boots up, it should be running the latest version of Windows 10.

 
Keep in mind that pre-release versions of the operating system are not intended to be used on your primary device, as there are always chances of bugs, errors, and features not working correctly.
