Title: You'll NEVER Believe What We Uncovered: Top Secret Tips to Mastering Item Identification in Diablo 2 Resurrected!

Are you a Diablo 2 Resurrected player looking for ways to master item identification in the game? Well, look no further because we have got some top secret tips that could help you become a pro!

As you progress through the game, you'll find yourself faced with various types of items that come in many shapes and forms. From weapons to armor, to runes, gems, and charms, all of these items play a critical role in your journey to defeating Diablo.

The game offers a simple way of identifying these items, which is by using an identified scroll. However, using a scroll for every item can get expensive, and you may find yourself short of gold. That's why we're here to share some tips on how you can master item identification in Diablo 2 Resurrected.

Tip #1: Use Color Codes to Identify Unidentified Items

One of the easiest ways to determine the rarity of an unidentified item is by looking at its color. These color codes range from white to grey, blue, yellow, gold, green, and purple. It's crucial to memorize these color codes as they indicate the item's rarity and worth.

A white item signifies that it is a common item with standard attributes. Grey items are junk items that do not hold any specific value. Blue items are magical items with random modifiers, whereas yellow items are rare and highly sought after as they offer more significant bonuses.

Gold items are set items that are obtained in a complete set to unlock additional bonuses, while green items are unique items with specific properties. Lastly, purple items are crafted items that are made using a recipe and offer unique properties.

Tip #2: Identify Gems and Runes for Free

Gems and Runes are highly valuable items in Diablo 2 Resurrected. However, identifying them requires a scroll, and as they may drop quite often, it can get expensive.

A way to avoid spending unnecessary gold on identifying gems and runes is by placing them into Horadric Cube and transmuting them. Transmutation will automatically identify the item, saving you the cost of using an identified scroll.

Tip #3: Learn the Item Types and Attributes

Knowing the various item types and their attributes is a key factor in mastering item identification in Diablo 2 Resurrected. Weapons, armor, rings, and amulets all have different attributes, and learning them will allow you to spot specific modifiers that can increase their values.

For example, A Barbarian needs a high Damage/Second Weapon whereas a Paladin requires weaponry with +Skills. Similarly, a Sorceress wants high Energy and Mana bonuses on her gear, while an Amazon might prefer Gear with increased Attack Rating and Dexterity.

By learning the different item types and their attributes, you'll be able to identify useful items quickly, making it easier to improve your character's stats.

Final Thoughts

Mastering item identification in Diablo 2 Resurrected is a crucial aspect of the game. It can help you save money and spot valuable items easily, making it an essential skill to learn. By applying these top-secret tips, you will be able to identify rare items quickly and enhance your gameplay.

Diablo 2 Resurrected saw the “Identify” mechanic dropped from the spell charts and fall into the category of a scroll call. This act of identifying items above a certain quality level has a few ways of working in-game. You need to identify items in order to be able to comprehend their abilities, quality, and stats. Unidentified items cannot be put to use and for this reason, you have to either sell them or identify them. In this guide, we’ll walk through how you can identify items in Diablo 2. Follow the steps mentioned below.
 
## How to Identify Items in Diablo 2 Resurrected?
 

 
To identify items in Diablo 2, all you need to do is right-click on the scroll of identify and click on the unidentified item. Furthermore, you can even ask Deckard Cain to identify items in exchange for gold. You can even get Cain to identify items for free conditionally. We’ve listed both these paths in detail in the undermentioned.
 
### How to Use the Scrolls of Identify in Diablo 2 Resurrected
 
The Scrolls Of Identify help you to identify items in Diablo 2 Resurrected, here’s how to get and use them.
 
- Kill as many enemies as you can whenever you’re exploring a region.
 - These enemies once dead often drop Scrolls of Identify.
 - Once you get these, you can equip them in your inventory and use them to identify an item.
 - To identify an item, right-click on the scroll then click the item you wish to identify.
 - You can store a limited number of scrolls, however, the Tome of Identify book can hold up to 20 scrolls.
 - The Tome Of Identify is pretty cheap and can be bought from Magic Vendors, the Jail, or the Catacombs.
 - In case you cancel or misclick- the scrolls will just cancel the action and won’t get wasted as was the case in Diablo I.
 - If you fall short of scrolls, you can choose to purchase them from vendors like Akara for 80 gold per scroll.
 - You can then stack 20 of these back in the Tome Of Identify to identify items.

 
### How to Identify Items Using Deckard Cain in D2R
 
Deckard Cain is a Horadric mage who helps you identify items in-game in exchange for gold in Diablo 2. However, you can also get him to identify items for free. Here’s how to do the same.
 
- In the “Search For Cain” quest, you need to successfully rescue Deckard Cain from the ruins of Tristram.
 - If accomplished, Cain will identify all items for free.
 - You can identify items by locating him in the main city for every quest in Diablo 2.
 - However, if you fail to rescue him, you can still ask him to identify items.
 - This will require you to shell out 100 gold per item.
 - It’d be better to opt for the Scrolls of Identify if you fail to rescue Cain since that costs 20 gold lesser than what Cain charges.

 
These steps will help you identify your items in Diablo II. A point to keep in mind is that while tougher and more demanding enemies may drop higher-level items, they won’t always be guaranteed to have insane, out-of-this-world stats. You will need to strategize your progression as your choices will affect your inventory and in-game currency.
 
That’s pretty much all there is to identify items in Diablo 2 Resurrected. We hope you liked this guide and it was of assistance to you. Here’s a guide featuring the best classes in Diablo 2 Resurrected. Be sure to check it out!
