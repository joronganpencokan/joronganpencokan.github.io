The developers have built a slide-out notification menu and repurposed the software buttons without significantly changing how Android works. I played Clash of Clans and Solitaire and fooled around in Chrome while trying Remix OS out. It was pretty stable, and it was the first time I felt that Android could move beyond the smartphone or tablet.
It also may sound like a small matter. But tapping into apps like Snapchat that are currently mobile-only is an appealing part of the experience. It speaks to how blending the mobile and desktop worlds can mean less time shifting between devices. With more potential and less distractions. However, it’s the most complicated of these software packages to set up. It would be best if you disabled Secure Boot, then chose Remix from the boot menu in Windows. You’re dual-booting. If you know your way around well enough, you’ll be fine. But if this concept sounds foreign, you’ll need to be willing to leap through several hoops to learn.
The remix is very stable and runs Android Marshmallow. However, I wouldn’t recommend using it as your primary unless your computing needs are minimal. And unfortunately, touch support didn’t work on my Surface Pro 4, unlike other alternatives I tried here. However, I suspect that touch would work with one of the many supported devices. However, I was impressed with the company behind it, which has been built here. It’s a great option if you want to do some Android gaming, as it handles numerous titles well.

 
## Bluestacks


Available for both Mac and Windows, Bluestacks has a clear focus on gaming. With several titles waiting for you to download once you fire it up. You go through the typical Android setup process. Lollipop style. The interface cleverly uses tabs to keep multiple apps running at once.
Several dedicated buttons along the side emulate features you’d typically do with a gesture or tap on a mobile device. You’ll find dedicated buttons for uploading an App, taking a picture, grabbing screenshots, and shaking the device. It’s handy for those games or apps where this performs some action. There is an extensive list of suggested games. We could also grab titles like Clash of Clans from the Play Store and get going without a problem. Installing other Android apps was easy; it put favorites like Keep just a click away on the desktop. Snapchat didn’t work for me; however, giving me an error when I tried to sign in. We found this to be the case with other apps, so your mileage may vary.
Another platform component is BlueStacks TV. Which allows you to stream some of your gaming action or view other live streams powered by Twitch. While we’re small fans of the video game streaming phenomenon. This is an excellent way to do it if you want to watch some mobile games in action. Overall, the capabilities are impressive, but we found the performance slow and buggy sometimes.

 
## Amiduos


Amiduos also gives you a more traditional Android experience. We also found it to be the most responsive version of Android. To work with the touch screen on my Surface. It’s still not as hyper-responsive as a Pixel C or an iPad. But it was neat that this experience could be hacked together.

Slide down from the top for the notification center, just like on a typical Android phone.
It’s a pretty good option for gaming and was relatively easy to use. But keep an eye out for all those unwanted extras baked in.

 
## The Future of Android


If nothing else, this exercise excited us about what it’ll be like to have Android apps on Chromebooks. There are already some good apps for those Chromebooks capable of running the Play Store. You can peer down the road and see that Android could be valid on a desktop. Although it’s still going to take some work to make it something we’d want to use every day.
