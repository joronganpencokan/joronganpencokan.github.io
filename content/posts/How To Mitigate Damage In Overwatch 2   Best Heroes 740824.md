# Unveiling the Secret to Winning Overwatch 2: Discover The Best Heroes to Mitigate Damage Like a Pro!

Overwatch 2 is the much-anticipated sequel to the popular multiplayer first-person shooter game, Overwatch. It promises to bring players a more immersive experience with new playable heroes, maps, and game modes. But, as any experienced Overwatch player knows, winning matches in this game requires a lot of strategy, teamwork, and skill. In this article, we'll dive into the world of Overwatch 2 and uncover the secrets to mitigating damage like a pro by discovering the best heroes to use in the game.

## Understanding Damage Mitigation

First, let's explain what damage mitigation is all about. Damage mitigation refers to reducing or minimizing the amount of damage that your hero takes from enemies. This is crucial in Overwatch 2 as it can impact your hero's longevity in battle and your team's chances of winning the match.

Several heroes in Overwatch 2 possess abilities that help mitigate damage. Some can do this by shielding themselves and their allies, while others can self-heal to sustain themselves in the fight. Knowing which heroes to choose and how to use their abilities in tandem with your team is key to victory.

## Discovering the Best Heroes for Damage Mitigation

1. **Reinhardt:** Reinhardt is an excellent hero for mitigating damage on both himself and his allies. His Barrier Field ability creates a sizeable shield that can soak up incoming damage, protecting him and his team from harm. Additionally, Reinhardt can charge into enemies, stunning them and pushing them away, which prevents them from doing any harm while his team sets up for a counterattack.

2. **Orisa:** Orisa, like Reinhardt, is a shield tank that can protect her team from incoming damage. Her Protective Barrier ability creates a stationary shield that can block enemy attacks and also protect her team from area damage. Orisa can also mitigate damage through her Fortify ability, which gives her increased resistance against enemy attacks.

3. **Moira:** Moira is a support hero that can mitigate damage through constant healing. Her Biotic Grasp ability can heal allies and deal damage to enemies at the same time. Additionally, Moira's Biotic Orb ability can provide a constant healing source for her team or damage enemies in its path.

4. **Lucio:** Lucio is another support hero that can mitigate damage while also providing utility to his team. His Crossfade ability has two modes, one that provides a constant healing boost to nearby allies and one that increases their mobility. Lucio can also protect his team with his Sound Barrier ability, which creates a large shield that blocks incoming damage for a short period.

5. **Zenyatta:** Zenyatta is the perfect hero for players who prefer a more passive approach to mitigating damage. As a support hero, Zenyatta can provide constant healing and damage buffs to his team. However, his main ability for damage mitigation is his Harmony Orb. This ability can only be used on one ally at a time, but it provides a constant healing boost to that ally, allowing them to sustain themselves in battle better.

## Conclusion

In Overwatch 2, mitigating damage is an essential component of winning matches. Choosing heroes with abilities that can shield, heal, or resist enemy attacks is key to keeping your team alive and in the fight. Reinhardt, Orisa, Moira, Lucio, and Zenyatta are just a few examples of the many heroes in Overwatch 2 that excel in damage mitigation. Try them out next time you play, incorporate them into your team strategy, and watch your chances of victory increase!
