# Halo Infinite Weekly Challenges in Trouble: How To Fix Them & Get Back To Winning Your Rewards!

Halo Infinite has been one of the most anticipated games of 2021, and it has finally arrived. Along with its release, 343 Industries introduced a new feature known as weekly challenges. The weekly challenges contain certain goals that need to be met within a specific time period. Once completed, the player is rewarded with various items such as armor coatings, emblems, and challenge points. 

However, the weekly challenges have recently hit a snag. Many players have been reporting that they are unable to complete the challenges due to various reasons such as bugs, glitches, and other technical issues. As a result, players are being denied rewards that they have legitimately earned. 

So, what can be done to fix the weekly challenges and ensure that players are able to obtain the rewards they deserve? Here are a few suggestions:

## Improve Communication

One of the main reasons that players are unable to complete weekly challenges is due to a lack of communication from the developers. While 343 Industries has tried to address some of the issues, they may not be aware of all the problems players are experiencing. Therefore, they should make every effort to communicate with the community, particularly on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit. Providing regular updates, acknowledging issues and informing players of upcoming fixes can alleviate some of the frustrations.

## Fix the Bugs and Glitches

Bugs and glitches are a natural part of any new release, but it is essential that they are addressed as quickly as possible. Halo Infinite is no exception. However, the current priority should be to fix the bugs and glitches that are preventing players from completing the weekly challenges. The development team should work to identify and address these issues, and test the solutions before rolling them out to ensure they work smoothly.

## Provide Appropriate Rewards

While the weekly challenges offer a wide array of rewards, players need to feel that their efforts are worth it. Too many challenges offer rewards that are not commensurate with the amount of work required to complete the challenge. While developers may want to keep rare items, such as certain armor coatings, elusive to encourage players to keep playing, it is essential to provide adequate rewards for the effort put in by players.

## Offer Alternative Challenges

If a particular challenge is experiencing significant issues, the development team could offer alternative challenges to incentivize gameplay. These challenges should be relatively easy to complete but also offer some level of reward. This way, players can continue to engage with the game while the issues with the original challenges are fixed. 

In conclusion, the weekly challenges in Halo Infinite offer a great opportunity for players to earn rewards, but the current issues surrounding them are preventing many players from enjoying the game fully. The suggestions above can help the development team address these issues and improve the overall experience for players. Hopefully, this will help get players back to enjoying the game and obtaining the rewards they rightfully deserve.

Players of Halo Infinite have recently come across an issue in the Weekly Challenges that results in tracking not taking place properly. Because of this error bug, any progress that you make when playing weekly challenges fails to register in the game.

In this guide, we will show you all of the possible solutions to bring an end to this bug.
 
## How to Fix Weekly Challenges Not Tracking in Halo Infinite?
 

 
### Join a Random Team in Halo Infinite
 
One of the possible solutions to the Weekly Challenges not tracking issue in Halo Infinite is to try joining a random team. You should try to do so instead of just joining challenges with your friends. Doing so might just result in your progress getting tracked.
 
### Restart Halo Infinite to fix Weekly Challenges Not Tracking Issue
 
Another really simple fix to take care of the weekly challenges not working bug in Halo Infinite is to quit the game and then relaunch it. Doing so might clear up any minor bugs that may be bogging down the game and solve the error.
 
### Use Challenge Swap Items
 
If you still notice that your progress is not being tracked in the game, your next best option might be to swap one of your challenge items with another one. You can preferably pick an item that will be able to track your progress.
 
### Restart the System
 
If the above solutions do not do the trick, you can try to simply restart your console or PC. Doing so might correct any issues by clearing obstructive apps running in the background.
 
### Check for Updates
 
Another great option is to look for updates. Since the game is still new, you can expect several patches and updates for any bugs and errors. We also recommend you check out the official Halo Support Page on Twitter for the latest news about updates, patches, and game news.
 
### Re-install Halo Infinite to fix Weekly Challenges not working
