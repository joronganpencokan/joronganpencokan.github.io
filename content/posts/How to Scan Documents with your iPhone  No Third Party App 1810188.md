# Revolutionize Your Document Scanning Game with This Simple iPhone Hack - No More Third Party Apps Needed!

If you are someone who frequently scans documents, a good scanner app can be a lifesaver. However, with the new iPhones that are equipped with powerful cameras, you might not need to rely on third party apps anymore. With just a simple hack, you can revolutionize your document scanning game and get the best results without downloading any additional apps.

## The Hack

To start this hack, you need to open your camera app and select the "Photo" option. Make sure you are in a well-lit area and have a clear view of the document that you want to scan. Place the document on a flat surface and make sure there is no glare on it.

Once you are in the camera app, tap to focus on the document and hold the phone still. If the lighting is not optimal, you can use the yellow sun icon and swipe up or down to adjust the exposure. This will help to bring out the details in your document and make it easier to read.

After you have focused on the document and adjusted the lighting, simply take a photo of it. You can take multiple photos of the same document if you need to capture more pages. Once you are done taking photos, go to the Photos app on your phone to view and edit your scanned documents.

## Editing Your Scanned Documents

Once you have your scanned documents in the Photos app, you can make edits to them before sharing or saving them. You can crop the document, adjust the brightness and contrast, and even mark it up with the built-in markup tool.

To crop the document, select the photo and tap the "Edit" option. From here, you can drag the corners of the photo to crop it into the desired size. To adjust the brightness and contrast, select the "Adjustments" option and swipe left or right to make your desired changes.

If you need to sign a document or add notes to it, you can do so using the markup tool. Simply select the "Markup" option and use your finger to draw on the document. You can use the pen tool, highlighter, or even the text option to write notes on the document.

## Conclusion

With this simple iPhone hack, you can revolutionize your document scanning game and get high-quality scans without relying on third party apps.
