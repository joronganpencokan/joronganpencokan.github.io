Discover the Secret Location of a Grounded Bird and Unlock the Amazing Power of Crow Feathers!

Have you ever stumbled upon a grounded bird, and wondered what to do with it? Despite their unfortunate situation, these birds can actually provide a great opportunity to connect with nature and unlock the amazing power of crow feathers.

First things first – if you come across a grounded bird, approach it with caution. It may be injured, sick, or just exhausted, and attempting to handle it could cause further harm. Observe the bird from a safe distance to determine its condition. If you believe it to be injured or ill, contact a wildlife rescue organization for help.

Assuming the bird is in good health and just needs a rest, the next step is to locate a safe and quiet space to keep it until it’s ready to fly away on its own. This could be a cardboard box with ventilation holes, filled with soft towels or blankets for the bird to nestle in. Keep the box in a warm, dry location away from people and pets.

While caring for the bird, take note of any feathers it may have shed. If you’re lucky enough to come across feathers from a crow or raven, you’re in for a treat! In many cultures, these black birds are associated with magic, intelligence, and even divination. Some believe that crows have the ability to see beyond what’s visible to the naked eye, making them a powerful symbol of intuition and insight.

If you’re looking to tap into the mystique of these birds, start by incorporating crow feathers into your home decor or personal style. Use them to decorate your altar or meditation space, or incorporate them into your jewelry and accessories. Some people even choose to create bespoke smudging tools with crow feathers, using them to purify and cleanse their space.

In addition to their symbolic value, crow feathers are also said to possess healing powers. Some believe that they can be used to ward off negative energy or bring good luck. To harness this energy, try carrying a crow feather with you, or tucking one into your pillowcase at night.

Whether you come across a grounded bird by chance, or seek out these magical creatures intentionally, there’s no denying the power of their feathers. Take the opportunity to learn more about these intelligent and mysterious birds, and unlock the secrets they hold within their beautiful black feathers.

Grounded has seen quite a lot of popularity even though it is in early access. Acknowledging this, Obsidian Entertainment has released a Thank You trailer where they revealed that millions of players have been coming together to survive, build, craft and fight off big enemies. And with it, they revealed that there will now be a Grounded bird…the crow. As we all know, crows can be terrifying and they eat anything and everything. Yikes. Let’s take a look at where to find the Crow in Grounded and get some more information like item drops from it.
 
## Where to Find the Crow Feather in Grounded
 
You will see the Grounded bird flying around and hear its cawing from a distance. The locations to find the Crow are the Bird Bath and the Laser Tower but then again, the bird will keep moving around.
 

 
You will not be able to interact or fight with it yet (phew). They can be a formidable enemy since players will be tiny in comparison.
 
The Grounded bird isn’t just for show though. You can get some useful resources from it like its feathers which can be found randomly. Make sure to look in the areas where you have seen the Crow, especially on grass.
 
## How to Use Crow Feathers
 
In order to cut the big Crow feather into smaller pieces (Crow Feather Pieces), you need a Tier 2 axe. With these pieces you can craft various items like the Simple Bed, Marksman’s Cap and Feather Arrow.
