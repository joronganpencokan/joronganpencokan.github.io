Xbox One version of Halo: Spartan Assault will arrive on December 24th. After the success of Microsoft releasing the franchise game on the Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 early this year, Xbox One owner will also get the chance to play the game for $14.99. The software giant is also planning to launch an Xbox 360 version of the game, but it won’t be released until some time in January 2014.
 
What’s the difference between Halo: Spartan Assault on Windows 8 and Windows Phone with the new version of Xbox One? The game is pretty much identical, with the difference that Microsoft is also including a new co-op mode for online gaming and more missions.
 

 
For those already playing the game on a PC or phone, note that Microsoft will offer a discount if you’re also planning to get Halo in your Xbox One. So, basically for those who bought the game before Dec. 15th, will be able to get the Xbox One version for only $4.99.
 
I would rather pay once and be able to play the Halo: Spartan Assault on any device at no extra cost, but the discount is better than paying for the game once again.
 
Update: It was released 2 days earlier than expected, Halo: Spartan Assault for Xbox One is already for sale in the Xbox marketplace.
