GIFs are a great way to express how you feel without having to type it out. That’s one of the many great features WhatsApp users can enjoy on the most popular instant messaging app. Did you now that you are not limited to the GIFs WhatsApp has?
 
There are other apps you can use, and you can also use your own content to create GIFs. If you ever wanted to turn your friend into a GIF, this is your chance. Let’s discover all your options when it comes to sending GIFs on WhatsApp.
 
## How to Create Your Own GIFs on WhatsApp
 
Creating GIFs on WhatsApp using your own content is easier than you think. To create a GIF, just open the contact you want to send the GIF to and choose a video. To turn that video into a GIF, you’ll need to shorten it. To do that, slide the edges of the videos until you see the GIF option appear.
 

 
Right below the GIF you’ll see how long your GIF is. At the top-right you can also add emojis, text, and even draw on your GIF. If you ever want to remove anything you added, merely tap on the back arrow. To send, simply tap on the arrow.
 
## How to Find GIFs Integrated in WhatsApp
 
If you’d rather stick to the GIFs that WhatsApp has to offer, you can do that, too. To the left of the text box, you’re going to see a happy face. Tap on that, and at the bottom you will see the GIF option.
 
At first you’ll only see random GIFs, but if you want to find a specific GIF, tap on the search option at the bottom. Once you type in the keywords, you’ll see a large variety of your preferred GIFs. To see a preview of your GIF, just tap on it, and to send, tap on the arrow on the bottom-right.
 
## Must-Have GIF Apps for WhatsApp
 
Giphy just had to be at the top of the GIF app list. It appears to be the most popular GIF app out there. It has such an extensive amount of options that you won’t know where to start.
 
You can either use the search bar or go through the various tabs such as Trending, Reactions, Actions, Emotions, MEMES, TV, Movies, Music, Animals, and more.
 
Another app you can try is Gif Free – All GIFs. It’s not nearly as popular as Giphy, but it does have a lot of great GIFs to offer. The GIFS are divided into categories and then into sub-categories.
 
For example, let’s say you’re looking for animal GIFs, when you go into that category, you’ll have to choose what kind of animal. You’ll need to choose between Frog, Hamster, Horse, Fish, Elephant, etc. Once you’ve selected your GIF, the app offers the share button right below the GIF.
 
You can directly share to WhatsApp, Messenger, Facebook, Snapchat, or download it.
 
## Conclusion
 
GIFs are one of the most commonly used features to express how you feel without having to type so much. Thanks to the above tips, you’ll always be able to find and send the best GIF for your mood, even if you have to make it yourself. Where do you get your GIFs from? Leave a comment and share your thoughts.
