Introduction:

Minecraft has become one of the most popular games in the world with its addictive gameplay, creative features, and interactive environment. With the rise of video content, Minecraft has also become a popular medium for creating videos showcasing gameplay, tutorials, and even fan-made animation. In this article, we will give you some tips on how to become a Minecraft video pro and make some epic videos.

Step 1: Brainstorming Ideas

The first step in creating any type of content is brainstorming ideas, and Minecraft videos are no exception. Some common ideas for Minecraft videos include, but are not limited to, gameplay walkthroughs, mods and add-ons, tutorials for building structures or redstone, and even role-playing. Look for inspiration on YouTube, Twitch, or Minecraft forums to get an idea of what works and what viewers enjoy watching.

Remeber, unique ideas and creative themes that stand out are often the most effective ones.

Step 2: Record your Gameplay

Now that you have an idea of what to make and how you want to make it, it's time to record your gameplay. There are a range of screen recording software programs available, such as OBS or XSplit. Play Minecraft while recording the footage and don't forget to capture audio from the game and from your microphone.

The audio is important for adding voice over or commentary later, so make sure you have a quality microphone that can capture crisp audio. It's also helpful to avoid background noise or loud music while recording.

Step 3: Edit your Footage

After recording your footage, it's time to edit it. Editing is where you can truly bring your creativity and personal flair into your video. Don't be afraid to cut and trim down your footage to only include the best parts, add interesting transitions or music, and overlay text to highlight a particular point or moment.

It's important to remember that shorter videos tend to perform better on YouTube, so keep it snappy and try to keep the video under 10 minutes to keep viewers engaged.

Step 4: Share your Video

The final step is uploading your video online. YouTube is the largest video sharing platform and one that caters to Minecraft videos particularly well. Alongside uploading your video, be sure to fill out the description and add relevant tags to help your video get found in search.

Advertise your video on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit to bring in more viewers.

Conclusion:

Creating Minecraft videos may seem daunting at first, but with these tips, you can unleash your inner Minecraft pro and create some epic content. Remember, brainstorm unique ideas, record quality audio and footage, edit creatively, and share it with the world. With practice and determination, you could become a renowned Minecraft content creator.

This article explains how to make Minecraft videos on Windows or Mac.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Record with Open Broadcaster Software and edit with a free video editor like iMovie or Sony Vegas.Do not commit to creating new content daily. Never sacrifice quality for quantity.Be yourself and your audience will love you for that.

 
##   No Easy Process  
 

Making Minecraft videos is no easy process. Whether it be Let’s Plays, Machinimas, Reviews, Redstone Tutorials or any of the other various video genres out there, it takes time. Nobody is perfect at the beginning, but this article will help you find your place in Minecraft video making scene online.

 
##   Finding Yourself  
 

Finding yourself is a big process in terms of making content on the internet. The issue with creating videos where anybody can see it is being original. Originality is always the main objective. When creating a product, ask yourself what you would enjoy. After you’ve answered your own question, ask how you could make the audience enjoy it with you.

 

Looking at someone successful and saying, “I’m going to do exactly what they do”, is more or less the wrong way to approach it. They’ve perfected their own craft, and sadly, if you’ve thought that, somebody else has as well. Be yourself and your audience will love you for that more than you know. You can be yourself easier than you can be somebody else.

 
##   Editing  
 

Ask any video maker what the most tedious process is in creating online entertainment and without a doubt, “editing” will be their answer. Without any knowledge​ of editing, do not expect to make videos with the quality of people who have been doing it for years. Exactly how it was said above, “they’ve perfected their own craft”.

 

If you’re brand new to editing and making videos, We highly suggest recording with OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) and editing with iMovie or one of the many free video editors depending on your operating system. After getting the hang of editing on those various software's, try moving up to Sony Vegas (Windows only) or Adobe Premiere (works on both).

 

Finding or inventing your own creative influence is extremely important when deciding how you'd like to create videos. Maybe your creativity comes from your commentary, while others focus on editing. While editing plays a major factor in both, it's not always bad to sometimes let the commentary speak for itself, literally. You will eventually find a balance and know how to portray yourself on the internet, creatively.

 
##   Patience  
 

The Minecraft community is absolutely huge! There are thousands of people uploading Minecraft content on a daily basis, making it very hard to get in and find your place. A thing to remember is that an audience will not grow overnight.

 

While some people may get very lucky and rise to the top quickly, that does not mean that everybody will. Put forth effort, time, and love into what you’re doing. If you’re doing it and it is not making you happy, perhaps video making is not for you. Do not confuse being discouraged for not enjoying it, however. Every video maker hits a rough patch, even the big ones. Keep trudging along, you’re bound to get an audience.

 
##   Quality, Not Quantity  
 

A giant misconception in not only the Minecraft video making scene but the YouTube scene, in general, is that creating content on the daily is a must. Do not submit yourself to that mindset unless you are absolutely positive that you are ready for that kind of commitment. Never sacrifice quality of a video because you need to get a video out for that day.

 

A good question to ask yourself when adding the potential final touches on a video is, “If I uploaded this, would I really enjoy this?” If the answer to that question is “No” then it is best not to upload it. If you wouldn’t enjoy your own creation, why should anybody else?

 
##   In Conclusion  
 

Originality is the key. Don’t get discouraged. Take your time while putting forth the effort. When you get into a rhythm of producing videos you will be able to produce them much more efficiently. Remember, Minecraft is a very hard community of YouTube to get noticed in.

 

With so many people attempting to do what some would call “the same as everything else”, it’s very easy to blend in. Stand out. Focus on the little things that everybody else doesn’t bat an eye at. If you perfect your craft, an audience will notice. It will definitely take some time, however.
