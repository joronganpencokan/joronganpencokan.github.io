But what happens when we accidentally delete or lose an important text message? Many of us are unaware that it's possible to recover deleted text messages from both iPhones and iPads.

## Backup Your Messages

Before you can recover any deleted text messages, it's essential to have a backup of them stored somewhere. That way, if the original message gets lost or deleted, all hope isn't lost. The most secure way to back up your messages is by using iCloud. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Go to Settings on your iPhone or iPad.

2. Tap on your Apple ID, and then select iCloud.

4. You can also go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage > Messages and click on Enable Messages in iCloud. This will automatically upload all your messages to iCloud and keep them in sync across all your devices.

## Restore Your Messages

Once you've backed up your text messages, it's time to restore them. There are two ways you can do this: 

### Option 1 - Restore Using iCloud Backup

1. Go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all Content and Settings.

2. Follow the prompts until you reach the Apps & Data screen, where you'll select "Restore from iCloud Backup".
