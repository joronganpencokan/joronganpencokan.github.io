# Keep Your Private Files Safe Against Hackers - Learn How To Set Up OneDrive Personal Vault Now!

With the increasing number of cyber threats faced by individuals and businesses alike, the importance of keeping our personal and sensitive files protected from hackers cannot be emphasized enough. One of the most effective ways to do this is by using OneDrive Personal Vault, a secure storage space within Microsoft's cloud storage service that requires strong authentication methods to access your files. 

In this article, we will take a closer look at OneDrive Personal Vault and guide you through the process of setting it up to keep your private files and information safe.

## Getting Started with OneDrive Personal Vault

To get started, you will need to have a Microsoft account and a subscription to Microsoft's OneDrive cloud storage service. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free Microsoft account and get 5GB of free storage. For larger storage needs, you can upgrade to one of the paid plans which offer up to 6TB of storage.

To access your OneDrive Personal Vault, log in to your OneDrive account and click on the Personal Vault option located under your OneDrive files. If you are accessing it for the first time, you will be prompted to set up an authentication method to verify your identity.

## Setting Up Authentication Methods for OneDrive Personal Vault

OneDrive Personal Vault requires users to go through a two-step authentication process to access their files, ensuring that only authorized individuals can view and modify them. There are three authentication methods available for Personal Vault:

### 1. PIN Code

A PIN code is a quick and easy way to access your Personal Vault on devices you trust. You can set up a 4- to 6-digit PIN code to unlock your Vault quickly.

### 2. Biometric Authentication

If your device has biometric authentication capabilities, such as a fingerprint scanner, you can use that to access your Personal Vault. This is a more secure and convenient way to unlock your Vault quickly.

### 3. Two-factor authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your Personal Vault by requiring you to enter a code sent to your registered phone number or email address. This is the most secure authentication method, especially if you enable this on all your devices.

## Uploading Files to Personal Vault

Once you have set up your authentication methods, you can start uploading files to your Personal Vault. This is as simple as dragging and dropping files from your computer to the Vault folder. You can also add photos and videos to the Vault from the OneDrive mobile app.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, OneDrive Personal Vault is a great way to keep your private files and information safe from hackers. By setting up strong authentication methods and uploading your files to the Vault, you can ensure that only authorized individuals can access your sensitive data. Follow the steps outlined in this article to set up your Personal Vault and enjoy peace of mind knowing that your important files are secure in the cloud.

Though my OneDrive files should be safe and secure in the cloud and on my various devices, I'm still concerned that files with confidential or sensitive information may be exposed. For that reason, I use a feature in OneDrive called Personal Vault.
By including specific OneDrive folders or files in this vault, you can add an extra layer of authentication required to access this content. 
By default, the vault remains locked until you need it. You unlock it with whatever method you use to protect your Microsoft account. After you unlock the vault, it automatically locks after a certain amount of time to again protect your files.

## Requirements


To take full advantage of the Personal Vault, you need a Microsoft 365 Family or Personal subscription. With either plan, you can add as many files to the vault as space allows. Without a Microsoft 365 plan, you can include only three files in your vault, which likely wouldn't do the trick for most people. Further, the Personal Vault is available only with the OneDrive personal app and not with OneDrive for Business. Otherwise, the vault works the same in Windows 10 and 11.
