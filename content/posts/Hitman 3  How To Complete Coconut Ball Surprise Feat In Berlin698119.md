# Unlock the Ultimate Hitman 3 Secret: Master the Coconut Ball Surprise Feat in Berlin NOW!

Hitman 3 has been out for a few months, and players have enjoyed the various assassinations, missions and challenges that the game has to offer. But, if you think you have checked everything off your list on this game, think again. There’s one final secret waiting for you in the Berlin level that you might have missed.

The Coconut Ball Surprise Feat, one of the most elusive and interesting quests in Hitman 3, is waiting to be conquered. However, this challenge has been a mystery to most players as no information is available on how you can execute this mission. It's time to change that! In this article, we’ll guide you on how to master the Coconut Ball Surprise Feat to unlock the ultimate Hitman 3 secret in the Berlin level.

First off, you'll need to start the level in the nightclub. From there, make your way to the back alley of the level where you’ll spot a well-lit area with four NPCs playing a game of Foosball. Keep your approach on stealth mode, then head up the stairs and take out the first two spectators you see. Once there are only two players left in the game, go up to the Foosball Table and play them.

Now, here’s the tricky part. You need to beat these players on Foosball with a score of 5 to 0, and without letting the ball enter your goal. If you were able to win the game, you will be rewarded with a surprise- a coconut ball.

With the coconut ball in hand, make your way through the crowd to find the nearest kitchen. The trick is to find a chef that is currently preparing food in the kitchen. Lure the chef to your position by simply tossing the coconut ball towards a nearby crate or chair, making the chef investigate the sound.

Take out the chef silently, then take his clothes to blend in as one of the chefs. Interact with the kitchen workstation, and you’ll be presented with a unique interaction option to “Prepare the Special Dish”. Choose this option, and you’ll create the Coconut Ball Surprise dish that is in your inventory.

Now that you have the dish, take it to the table next to the Foosball game, and place it there. One of the Foosball players will come to check it out and will eat it, thereby triggering the challenge.

Now, all you need to do is finish the level without being detected. If you do this, you will be rewarded with the prestigious Coconut Ball Surprise Feat, which will unlock the Secret Codebreaker Achievement.

In conclusion, mastering the Coconut Ball Surprise Feat is one of the most challenging yet exciting quests in the Berlin level of Hitman 3. If you think you have what it takes to complete this mission, then follow our guide, and you'll unlock the ultimate hitman 3 secret. So what are you waiting for? Get out there and master that Foosball game!
