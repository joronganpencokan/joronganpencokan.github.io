Twitter boasts of an array of GIFs relevant to different categories, but the process of saving these GIFs has been elusive. However, with a few steps and tools, downloading your favorite Twitter GIFs becomes a straightforward process.

The video downloader extension will enable you to download the Twitter GIFs on your desktop without adding the URL of the image. Different browsers have video downloader extensions that you can install. For instance, the "Video DownloadHelper" is a Firefox extension compatible with Mac, Windows and Linux devices, allowing users to download GIFs with ease.

After installing the video downloader extension, a download icon will appear on your browser's toolbar every time you come across a Twitter GIF. You can tap on the icon, and the GIF will download on your device.

All you have to do is navigate to your Twitter feed, locate the GIF you wish to save, start the screen recording, and move the GIF on your screen for the recording to capture. Once your recording captures the whole GIF, you can stop recording, and the GIF will be saved on your device.

## Using Third-Party Applications

 Several third-party applications allow users to download Twitter GIFs with ease. Gifitize is a popular app that allows you to save Twitter GIFs. Gifitize works by compiling and saving all the GIFs you come across on Twitter. You can filter through the saved GIFs by searching or creating playlists.

To use the app, download Gifitize from your app store, log in with your Twitter account, and give the app access to your Twitter. After logging in, you can then browse your Twitter timeline, locate the GIF, and save it to your device.

With the ability to share GIFs on Twitter, it is definite to see a large number of GIFs all over the platform. And with such a spread, it is likely for you to come across GIFs that you wish you could save and use in your future conversations. Unfortunately, unlike other websites or services, Twitter does not allow you to save GIFs on its platform directly onto your device. The reason behind this is the way Twitter handles GIFs on its platform. Rather than showcasing GIFs as GIFs, it instead converts them into a video file in its own proprietary video format.
So, in this article, we take a look at different ways to save a GIF from Twitter on Computer/Android/iOS.

 
### Saving a GIF on Computer


One of the easiest ways to save GIFs from Twitter is by using a computer. Unlike other platforms, it does not require the need to download any additional software to accomplish this. Instead, all you require for this method is a computer and a web browser to visit the EZGIF website. EZGIF is an online animated GIF maker and image editor that allows you to upload and edit GIF images for free. Here are the steps:
1. Open the EZGIF website in a browser, tap on ‘Video to GIF’ option from the menu, and select the ‘Video to GIF’ option again from its sub-menu. As mentioned above, we are using the ‘Video to GIF’ option because Twitter saves GIFs in its proprietary video format.
 
2. Open Twitter in a new tab and visit the tweet with the GIF you want to save.
3. Tap the share button on the bottom of the tweet and copy the link to the Tweet by selecting the ‘Copy link to Tweet’ option.
4. Go back to the EZGIF website tab and paste the copied URL (link) in the input box below ‘OR paste video url:’.

5. Once done, hit the ‘Upload Video’ button.
6. On the next screen, you will see a bunch of options like Start time, End time, Size, Frame rate, and Method to customize the GIF, which you can fiddle around with as per your requirements.

7. Finally, hit the ‘Convert to GIF!’ button.

You will see the result for conversion in the ‘Output GIF’ section below the ‘Convert to GIF!’ button. From here, you can either save the GIF on your computer using the ‘save’ button or perform actions like crop, resize, rotate, etc., on the converted GIF.
Once you hit the save button to save the converted GIF to your computer, the save window pops up with a few different options. From here, make sure you select the Format as ‘GIF image’ and the file extension as ‘.gif’.
Although you can access the EZGIF website in a browser on an Android and iOS device, the ease of use that you would get on a computer is far-fetched. This is why downloading a platform-specific dedicated app on these platforms is the ideal way to save a GIF from Twitter.

 
### Saving a GIF on Android


To save a GIF from Twitter on Android, we recommend you use the ‘Tweet2GIF’ app. It is a pretty straightforward app with an easy-to-use interface to get the task done without much hassle.
This is how you do it.
1. Download and install ‘Tweet2GIF’ app from the PlayStore.
2. Open the tweet with the GIF you want to save, hit the arrow-down button, and select the ‘Copy link to Tweet’ option.
 
3. Open the Tweet2GIF app, and in the Url input field, paste the URL (link) you just copied.

 
4. Finally, hit the ‘Download GIF’ button to save the GIF to your device.

You can access the saved GIF in the directory that you set as the default download directory. Additionally, you can also download the MP4, share the GIF via different apps, access the previous history, and perform a few more customizations using the settings.

 
### Saving a GIF on iPhone


Similar to how you used a platform-specific app on an Android to save a GIF from Twitter, you can use a dedicated app for iOS to accomplish the same. The app available for this purpose on iOS is GIFwrapped. Besides allowing you to search for a GIF you found on Twitter, it comes with its own library of GIFs based on different moods and situations.
Below are the steps involved.
1. Download and install ‘GIFwrapped’ app from the App Store.
2. Open the tweet with the GIF you want to save and hit the share button. And from here, select the ‘Copy link to Tweet’ option.
 
3. Open the GIFwrapped app and hit the search icon at the bottom.
4. Finally, paste the URL (link) you copied in the search bar on top and hit ‘Search.’ Alternatively, hit the ‘Use the Clipboard’ to directly paste the link you copied in the search bar and get the result.

The app presents the result for your GIF and allows you to save it to your photo library. Additionally, it also offers a bunch of other features like the ability to sync the GIFs with Dropbox, change Pixel Density, host, etc. And as mentioned above, you can also use the app to search for various kinds of GIFs based on different moods and situations.
Now that you have downloaded the GIF you wanted, you can freely share it across different platforms and engage more expressively than before.
