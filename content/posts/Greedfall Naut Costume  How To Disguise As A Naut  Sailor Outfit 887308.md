## How to Disguise as Naut in Greedfall (Naut Uniform)
 
There are two ways to find the Naut Costume in Greedfall:
 

 
- Storeroom: In the Storeroom, head towards the chest to find the Sailor’s Coat which is the Naut Costume disguise. It’s in this room you will find a sailor, a book placed on a table and also a chest where there’s the outfit.

 
- Harbor Master’s Office: To get the costume from Harbor Master’s Office, you have to be stealthy and get to the room upstairs. Open it up and check the chest where you will find Sailor’s Coat, Sailor’s Boots, Sailor’s Gloves and Gold Coins. Make sure to not be detected by the guards.

 
These were basically the ways to get the Greedfall Naut Costume and disguise as Naut easily. With the Torso aka the Costume, you will be able to trick the guards and gain access to forbidden areas. If you don’t have this sailor disguise, you may end up in problems with the Naut faction.
