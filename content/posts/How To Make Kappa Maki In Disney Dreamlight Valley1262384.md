Moisten the edge of the Nori sheet with water and seal the roll.

## How to Make Kappa Maki in Disney Dreamlight Valley
 

 
To prepare this entrée, you might have to travel to multiple biomes. Every dish in this game has a Star Rating. The number of Stars indicates the number of ingredients you will need to make the dish. Kappa Maki is a three-star dish in the Dreamlight Valley meaning you will require three ingredients.
 
These three ingredients are:
 
- Cucumber
 - Seaweed
 - Rice

 
### Cucumber
 
Cucumber is available in Frosted Heights so you must unlock this biome for 10,000 Dreamlight. We are assuming you have already unlocked the Forest of Valor as you have to enter through there. When you reach Frosted Heights, head over to Goofy’s stall there and repair it. Now, you can buy Cucumber seeds for 40 Star Coins. However, you can upgrade the stall to buy Cucumber itself for 239 Star Coins. If you choose to plant the cucumber seeds then you will have to wait for over an hour before they can be harvested.
 
### Seaweed
 
Another ingredient needed to make Kappa Maki in Dreamlight Valley is Seaweed. There are two ways you can acquire Seaweed. You can either go fishing at water bodies where bubbles are not present. Or you can head to Dazzle Beach and pick them off the shore.
 
### Rice
 
To get Rice, head over to the Glade of Trust and visit Goofy’s Stall. If you have already repaired it, you can buy Rice Seeds for 35 Star Coins. Plant these seeds and wait for 50 minutes to harvest Rice.
 
Head over to the cooking station with these ingredients and toss them in the cooking pot. And voila! Your Kappa Maki is ready. You can either consume it for energy, sell it for Star Coins, or as we mentioned, give it to Ursula.
 
That’s all from us on how to make Kappa Maki in Disney Dreamlight Valley. Some ingredients in this game can be tough to find. Make sure you check our guides on how to get Cocoa Beans, Vanilla, and more in the Dreamlight Valley section.
