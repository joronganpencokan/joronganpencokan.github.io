Introduction

In today's world, communication is a vital aspect of our everyday lives. We talk with our loved ones, clients or colleagues and almost everyone we meet, updating them about our daily routines, business transactions, or sharing jokes, among other things. However, in some cases, calling costs are significantly high, and this can limit our communication. Nevertheless, the introduction of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) accounts has come in handy, providing unlimited free communication. In this article, we will unlock the secret to obtaining SIP accounts and achieving free calling.

What is SIP?

So, what exactly is SIP, and how does it work? SIP is a protocol used for initiating, modifying and terminating communication sessions over the internet. SIP facilitates the transmission of real-time voice and video data between two parties using a network that supports Internet Protocol (IP). This protocol acts as a mediator between the two communicating devices, ensuring they can efficiently and effectively communicate.

How can you obtain your own SIP account?

Step 1: Select a SIP account provider.

You must choose a SIP account provider to obtain your SIP account. Several providers offer these services, including OnSIP, 3CX, and Twilio. Check their terms of service and select the best provider that suits your needs.

Step 2: Sign up for an account.

Once you have decided which provider is best for you, go ahead and sign up for an account. Once you fill the sign-up form, you will receive login credentials through your email. Keep these credentials safe to use them to login to your SIP account.

Step 3: Configure your device.

Configuring your device is the final step. Here, you have to enter the credentials you received from the provider, which includes a username, password, and server address. Once you do this, you can make calls and communicate with your contacts freely.

SIP is a protocol that gives you a unique identification (a SIP number or address) on the internet that you can use as a phone number or email address to make and receive voice calls for free. Use it to reach any SIP, landline, or mobile user worldwide. Here is how you can register for a SIP account.

 
##   Choose a SIP Service  
 

The first thing to do is choose a SIP service. There are plenty out there. You can choose a free SIP account as a beginner, or, if you require additional features and services, opt for a premium SIP account. Here is a list of free SIP providers.

 
##   Go to Their Register Page  
 

Once you have found a service, use your browser to go to the website and look for the link that takes you to the register page. It is normally found near the login option. Once on the page, you will be presented with a registration form, which you will need to fill out.

 
##   Decide on a Username  
 

Just like for an email address, you should match your username to the public image you'd like to maintain through your SIP activities. The username needs to be unique, and it may be that your preferred name is already taken. The username you choose will then be part of an SIP address, which resembles an email address with the @ symbol; for example, memyself@thatsipservice.info.

 
##   Choose a Password  
 

It's important to choose a strong password. Follow the fundamentals of password creation, but be sure to write it down or use a password manager to remember it.

 
##   The Rest as Usual  
 

For some SIP servers, there may be additional information required of you, such as the time zone, a captcha entry, or an email address. A valid email is essential since your full SIP credentials will be sent to it. Most services also require the email to be a "real" account.

 
##   Check Your Email  
 

In most cases, the credentials needed to configure your SIP phone will be sent to you via email. That email is important. Make sure it does not get dumped into the Junk folder. The information that you will have to save includes the following:

 
- SIP address, for example, memyself@thatsipservice.infoPasswordUsername, for example, memyselfDomain/Realm, for example, thatsipservice.infoOutbound proxy, for example, proxy.proksi.comXCAP root, for example, https://xcap.proksi.com/xcap-root

 

The email may also contain some useful information on how to access your account and change settings, how to configure your SIP software or hardware phone, and other technical information.

 

Once you have a new SIP account, you can configure it with a SIP softphone app and start enjoying free VoIP communication.
