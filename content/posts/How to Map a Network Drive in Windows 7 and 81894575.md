Windows 7 and 8 are two of the most popular operating systems in use today. When it comes to accessing files across multiple devices across a network, users can take advantage of network drive mapping. Mapping network drives on Windows is a simple and easy-to-use feature that involves assigning a drive letter to a shared folder or disk volume. This way, the shared folder or disk volume appears as a local drive on Windows Explorer, allowing for faster access to files and documents stored on the network.

However, mastering network drive mapping can be a bit of a challenge for beginners. Here are some essential tips to help you unlock the secrets of network drive mapping on Windows 7 and 8.

**Tip 1: Ensure that both PCs are connected to the same network**

Before you can begin to assign a drive letter to a shared folder, both the host PC and the client PC need to be connected to the same network. You can check this by opening the Network and Sharing Center window on both PCs and ensuring that they are connected to the same network.

**Tip 2: Share the folder or disk volume on the host PC**

To access a shared folder or disk volume on another PC, you need to share the folder or disk volume on the host PC. To do this, right-click on the folder or disk volume that you want to share, select Properties, click on the Sharing tab, and then click on the Advanced Sharing button. After that, select the option to share the folder or disk volume and give it a name.

**Tip 3: Make sure you have the correct permissions**

Once the shared folder or disk volume is created, you need to ensure that the client PC has the correct permissions to access it. To do this, right-click on the shared folder or disk volume, select Properties, click on the Sharing tab, and then click on the Permissions button. From there, you can give the appropriate users or groups the necessary permissions to access the shared folder or disk volume.

**Tip 4: Map the network drive**

After ensuring that both PCs are connected to the same network, the shared folder or disk volume is shared, and the client PC has the correct permissions, you can now map the network drive. To do this, go to the client PC and open the Windows Explorer window. From there, click on the Map network drive button, select the drive letter that you want to assign to the shared folder or disk volume, and enter the location of the shared folder or disk volume in the Folder field.

**Tip 5: Automate the network drive mapping process**

Mapping network drives using the Windows Explorer can be a bit time-consuming, especially when you need to do it on multiple PCs. However, you can automate the process of mapping network drives using a PowerShell script. PowerShell is a powerful command-line tool that allows you to automate various tasks on Windows.

To create the PowerShell script, you can use the following code:

```
New-PSDrive -Name "X" -PSProvider FileSystem -Root "\\servername\sharedfolder" -Persist
```

Where "X" is the drive letter that you want to assign, "\\servername\sharedfolder" is the location of the shared folder or disk volume, and "Persist" ensures that the drive is mapped every time the PC is restarted.

In conclusion, mapping network drives on Windows 7 and 8 is a simple and easy-to-use feature that can save time and improve productivity when accessing files across multiple devices on a network. By following these essential tips, you can master network drive mapping and unlock the secrets of Windows 7 and 8.

##   How to Map a Network Drive in Windows 7 and Windows 8  
 

A mapped drive enables users to take advantage of the storage on other devices in the network. Instead of downloading or copying the same data to all your devices, you save the data in a single folder and then share the folder. After you share the location of this data via a UNC path, you can map the network drive to all your devices with a few simple steps. Here's how.

 
- Launch File Explorer.
 - Select Computer from the left navigation bar.
 - Select Map network drive.
 - Select the drive letter for the network drive you would like to map, enter the UNC path in the Folder text field, then select Finish.
 - The UNC path is the location of the shared folders you want to connect to. For example: "\\testserver\share\test" tells the computer that's the shared folder you want to connect to on the network drive you specified in the Drive letter drop down.
 - If you are prompted for credentials, enter the credentials for an account that has the required permissions to access the file or folder.
 - Accounts that do not have these permissions will fail to create a connection to the network drive.

 

Launch File Explorer.

 

Select Computer from the left navigation bar.

 

Select Map network drive.

 

Select the drive letter for the network drive you would like to map, enter the UNC path in the Folder text field, then select Finish.

 
The UNC path is the location of the shared folders you want to connect to. For example: "\\testserver\share\test" tells the computer that's the shared folder you want to connect to on the network drive you specified in the Drive letter drop down.
 

If you are prompted for credentials, enter the credentials for an account that has the required permissions to access the file or folder.

 
Accounts that do not have these permissions will fail to create a connection to the network drive.
 
As of January 2020, Microsoft is no longer supporting Windows 7. We recommend upgrading to Windows 10 to continue receiving security updates and technical support.
