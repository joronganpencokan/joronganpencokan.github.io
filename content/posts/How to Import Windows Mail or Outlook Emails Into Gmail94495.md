Emails have become an integral part of our lives, both personally and professionally. And since Gmail has become one of the most widely used email platforms, it's only natural to want to import your Windows Mail or Outlook emails into Gmail. Doing so can make your life easier by consolidating all your email accounts in one place.

If you're new to Gmail or are unsure of how to import your emails, don't worry! We've got you covered. In this article, we'll explain how you can import your Windows Mail or Outlook emails into Gmail in a few easy steps.

## Step 1: Enable IMAP in Gmail

First things first, you need to enable IMAP in Gmail. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a common protocol used by email clients to retrieve emails from a mail server. Follow these steps to enable IMAP:

1. Open your Gmail account and click on the gear icon in the top right corner.
2. Go to Settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP.
3. Under the IMAP Access section, select Enable IMAP.
4. Click on Save Changes.

## Step 2: Add Your Windows Mail or Outlook Account to Gmail

Now that IMAP is enabled in Gmail, you can add your Windows Mail or Outlook account to Gmail. Here's how:

1. Open your Gmail account and click on the gear icon in the top right corner.
2. Go to Settings > Accounts and Import.
3. Under the Import mail and contacts section, click on Import mail and contacts.
4. A new window will appear. In the Email address field, enter the email address of your Windows Mail or Outlook account.
5. Click on Continue.
6. Enter the password for your Windows Mail or Outlook account.
7. Click on Continue.
8. Select the items you want to import, such as your emails, contacts, and calendar events.
9. Click on Start import.

## Step 3: Wait for the Import to Complete

The import process can take some time, depending on how many emails and other items you're importing. You can close the import window and go about your day while the import process completes in the background. Once the import is complete, you'll receive a notification from Gmail.

## Step 4: Check Your Imported Emails

After the import is complete, you'll be able to see your Windows Mail or Outlook emails in your Gmail account. To access your imported emails, follow these steps:

1. Open your Gmail account.
2. Click on the More dropdown menu in the left sidebar.
3. Select the label that corresponds to your Windows Mail or Outlook account.

That's it! You've successfully imported your Windows Mail or Outlook emails into Gmail. Now you can manage all your emails in one place and enjoy the benefits of Gmail's features, including powerful search capabilities, advanced spam filtering, and customizable labels.

In conclusion, importing your Windows Mail or Outlook emails into Gmail is a simple process that can save you time and effort. Follow the four steps we've outlined in this article, and you'll be able to revolutionize your email game with ease.

##   How Does This Work?  
 

To migrate emails from other accounts into Gmail, you must first set up both accounts in the email client of your choice (e.g., Windows Mail or Outlook). Be sure to use the Gmail IMAP settings when setting up that account. You might also want to make a new folder in Gmail specifically for your imported messages.

 

Hold down the Ctrl key, then click-and-drag the highlighted messages into a folder under your Gmail account in the left pane.

 

Another way to copy emails into Gmail is to right-click the highlighted message and select Move > Copy to Folder, and then pick a folder from your Gmail account.

 

As long as your Gmail account is set up to communicate with the Gmail IMAP server, anything you do to Gmail on your computer will sync with the online version. As a result, any emails you copy to Gmail from your other accounts will be uploaded to your online version of Gmail. The next time you read your Gmail messages from the Gmail mobile app or website, you'll see those same messages that used to be stored only in Outlook or Windows Mail.

 

Though not as smooth, an alternative method is to use Thunderbird. To do that, you have to first import the messages from Outlook or Windows Mail into Thunderbird and then copy the Thunderbird messages into Gmail.

 

Aside from manually copying all new messages into Gmail each time they come in, you can also set up your email client to forward messages to Gmail automatically or configure Gmail to check mail from your other account(s).

 
If you have messages in Outlook that you want to copy over to Gmail, all you have to do is select them and copy them into your Gmail account.
