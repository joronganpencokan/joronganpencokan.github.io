# 10 Surprising Tricks to Reduce Your Desktop Clutter in a Single Click on Windows 10!

If you are like most people who use a desktop computer with Windows 10, you may have experienced clutter on your desktop. That is, you may have so many icons on your desktop that it becomes difficult to find what you are looking for.

The good news is that you do not need to spend hours cleaning up your desktop. With a few simple tricks, you can reduce your desktop clutter in a single click on Windows 10. Here are 10 surprising ones:

## 1. Use Windows 10's built-in cleaner tool

Windows 10 comes with a built-in cleaner tool that helps you to get rid of unnecessary files and programs from your computer. You can use this tool to clean up your desktop by removing files that you no longer need.

To use the cleaner tool, type "Disk Cleanup" in the search bar and select the option. From there, you can choose which files to delete, including the files on your desktop.

## 2. Use a desktop organizer app

A desktop organizer app helps you to clean up your desktop by organizing your icons into categories. For example, you can categorize your icons into folders such as "Games," "Work," "Media," and "Internet."

There are several desktop organizer apps available for Windows 10, including Stardock Fences, Rainmeter, and Winstep Nexus. These apps help to free up space on your desktop and make it easier for you to find what you are looking for.

## 3. Use a virtual desktop

Windows 10 comes with a virtual desktop feature that allows you to create multiple desktops. You can use this feature to keep your desktop clutter-free by creating a separate desktop for each project or task.

To create a virtual desktop, click on the Task View button on the taskbar, and select the new desktop button. You can then move the icons from your cluttered desktop to the new virtual desktop to keep them organized.

## 4. Create shortcuts for frequently used programs

If you have programs that you use frequently, it is a good idea to create shortcuts for them. You can then place these shortcuts on your desktop for quick access.

To create a shortcut, right-click on the program's icon in the Start menu, and select "Create Shortcut." You can then drag the shortcut to your desktop to access it easily.

## 5. Use keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are a great way to reduce clutter on your desktop. You can use keyboard shortcuts to quickly access your programs and files without having to navigate through your cluttered desktop.

For example, you can use the Windows key + R to quickly launch the Run dialog box, or Windows key + E to launch File Explorer. You can find a complete list of keyboard shortcuts on Windows 10 by searching online.

## 6. Use a minimalist wallpaper

A cluttered wallpaper can make your desktop look even more cluttered. To reduce clutter on your desktop, it is a good idea to use a minimalist wallpaper.

A minimalist wallpaper is an image that is simple and not too distracting. You can find several minimalist wallpapers online that are perfect for reducing clutter on your desktop.

## 7. Use the Windows search function

The Windows search function allows you to quickly find files and programs on your computer. You can use this function to access your files without having to navigate through your cluttered desktop.

To use the search function, click on the Search bar on the taskbar and type in the name of the file or program you are looking for. Windows will then display the relevant results.

## 8. Use a dock

A dock is a bar that sits at the bottom of your desktop and allows you to quickly access your programs and files. You can use a dock to keep your desktop clutter-free and make it easier to find what you are looking for.

There are several dock apps available for Windows 10, including RocketDock and ObjectDock. These apps allow you to customize your dock with different icons and themes.

## 9. Use a cloud storage service

Cloud storage services like Dropbox and Google Drive allow you to store your files in the cloud instead of on your desktop. This can help to reduce clutter on your desktop and free up space on your computer.

You can simply drag and drop your files into your cloud storage folder, and they will be uploaded to the cloud. You can then access these files from anywhere and on any device.

## 10. Use a virtual assistant

Finally, you can use a virtual assistant like Cortana to reduce clutter on your desktop. Cortana can help you to search for files and programs, set reminders, and provide helpful tips.

To use Cortana, click on the Search bar on the taskbar and type in your query or command. Cortana will then provide you with the relevant results or execute the command for you.

In conclusion, reducing clutter on your desktop can help to improve your productivity and make it easier for you to find what you are looking for. By using these 10 surprising tricks on Windows 10, you can reduce clutter on your desktop in a single click!

Minimizing windows that aren’t active helps you optimize the limited screen estate of computer screens.

 
- Tap the minimize icon to hide the window to the taskbar.
 - Tap the icon on the taskbar again to maximize the window.

 
##   Where Are the Minimize and Maximize Buttons?  
 

The Minimize and Maximize buttons are located in the top-right corner of the application window's title bar. The Minimize icon looks like a dash or an underscore. The Maximize/Restore icon is usually a square when maximized partially or two overlapping squares when it is maximized completely. The last icon in the group is the X button to close the app.

 - Right-click anywhere to display the menu.
 - Select Minimize to hide the window to the taskbar.

##   What Is the Shortcut Key for Minimize?  
 

Shortcut keys are the only ways to minimize your screen without a mouse. Here are the combinations you can turn into a habit. 

 

Shortcut 1: Alt + Space + N

 

The Alt + Spacebar combination opens the tiny system menu with the minimize and maximize options. The extra “N” modifier selects the minimize option in the menu (you can see the letter underlined in the minimize command). This combination will only work if your PC’s default language is English.

 

Shortcut 2: Windows Key + M

 

This will minimize all open windows. Press Windows + Shift + M to restore all the minimized windows.

 

Shortcut 3: Windows Key + Home

 

This shortcut will minimize all apps except the active one.

 

Shortcut 4: Windows Key + Down Arrow

 - Drag the corners to resize the application window to any suitable dimension.
 - Windows remembers this size, and tapping the Restore Down button from a maximized state shrinks the app's window to this shape and location.
