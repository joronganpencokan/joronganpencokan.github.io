GParted is a Linux-based tool designed to create, delete, copy, resize, move, or label partitions with different file systems, such as ntfs, btrfs, ext2/3/4, f2fs, FAT16/32, hfs/hfs+, linux-swap, luks, lvm2 pv, nilfs2, reiserfs/4, udf, ufs, and xfs. 
 
Although Windows 10 includes its own partition manager that should be enough for most users, it lacks of some essential features, such as the ability to move partitions, which can come in handy when managing multiple partitions on a single drive. For instance, when you’re deleting one of the partition on the drive, and you need to move another partition to be able to extend the Windows 10 or another partition.
 
In this guide, you’ll learn the steps to move partitions within a drive on a Windows 10 device using GParted.

However, before you start with the tool, you need to make sure that your device can boot from USB. Typically, you’ll need to access your device Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) hitting one of the function keys (F1, F2, F3, F10, or F12), the ESC, or the Delete key during boot.
 
Once inside the firmware, look for the Boot section and make sure the boot order is set to the drive that contains the Windows 10 installation files, and do not forget to save the configuration.
 
The BIOS/UEFI can be different depending on the manufacturer and even per computer model, as such make sure to check your manufacturer support website for more specific instructions.
