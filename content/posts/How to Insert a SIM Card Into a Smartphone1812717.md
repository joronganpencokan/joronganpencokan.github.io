Inserting a SIM card into your smartphone is easy, but it can seem a little confusing if you've never done it before. To get you started, here's an explanation of the different types of SIM cards, along with step-by-step instructions on how to insert a SIM card properly in an Android or iPhone.

 
##   The Different Types of SIM Cards  
 

There are three main sizes of SIM cards in use today: Nano SIM, Micro SIM, and Standard SIM (for older phones). The only difference is the size of the border around the chip, which allows the SIM to fit into different models of phones.

 

The size of SIM card you'll use depends on the make and model of your smartphone. The majority of modern smartphones take a Nano or Micro SIM, with some older phones using a Standard SIM.

 
- Nano SIM: iPhone 5/5C/5S and up, Google Pixel/Nexus, and Galaxy S7/Note8 and newer.Micro SIM: iPhone 4/4S, older Nokia, LG, Huawei, and Motorola phones, and the Samsung Galaxy J series.Standard SIM: Mostly found in older phones like the iPhone 3GS or the Samsung Galaxy Ace.

##   Choosing the Correct SIM Card Size  
 

If you're ordering a new mobile service, your SIM card will come attached to a larger plastic card. Just pop out the right size chip from the card (but don't pop it out until you're sure what size you need).

 
##   How to Insert a SIM Card Into an iPhone or Newer Android Phone  
 

iPhones and newer Android phones use a small tray where you can remove and insert your SIM card. On iPhones, this tray can be found on the right side of your phone. On Android, it can be found either on the side or top of the device.

 
- Power off your smartphone.
 - Holding the front of the phone facing you, locate the SIM card tray on your smartphone. The SIM card tray has a small hole in it which is used to pop the tray out.

 - Next, pop the tray out by inserting a SIM removal tool into the hole of the SIM card tray. If you don't have a SIM removal tool, you can use a paperclip or a pushpin instead.

 - SIM card trays are delicate and easily broken. The tray should come out easily, so don't force it. If you're having issues removing the tray or it's stuck, contact the phone's manufacturer for support.
 - Now, pull the SIM card tray out of the iPhone. Make a note of how the SIM card tray fits into the slot by checking the direction of the hole. This will be helpful later when you're reinserting the SIM tray,

 - This step is important. Set your SIM card into the tray with either the logo or gold chip size up. Note that the SIM card tray has a small notch in one of the corners, and the card will only fit one way.
 - On newer smartphones, the tray may have more than one slot (see image below). The smaller slot is for a Nano SIM, and the larger slot is for a Micro SD card (to expand data storage). Some trays may even have two Nano SIM slots for two phone numbers. If you only have one SIM, use the SIM 1 slot.

 - With the front of the phone facing you, push the SIM tray back into the phone. Make sure the tray is in the same position as when you removed it. It only fits one way, and it should go in easily. Never force the tray back in.
