# Discover the Secret to Running Apple Apps on Windows 11 with this Step-by-Step Guide!

If you are a Windows 11 user who loves Apple apps, then this guide is for you. Historically, Apple apps have been exclusive to Mac and iOS devices, making it difficult for Windows users to use them. But with the release of Windows 11, there is now a way to run Apple apps on your PC. In this guide, we will show you the steps to follow to run Apple apps on your Windows 11 computer.

## Step 1: Download and Install BlueStacks

The first step is to download and install BlueStacks. BlueStacks is an Android emulator that allows you to run Android apps on your PC. So how does this help you run Apple apps on your PC? Well, Apple apps can be run on iOS devices, and BlueStacks has an iOS emulator that can run iOS apps, including Apple apps. So, go to the official BlueStacks website and download the version that is compatible with your Windows 11 PC.

## Step 2: Install the BlueStacks iOS Emulator

Once you have downloaded and installed BlueStacks, the next step is to install the iOS emulator. To do this, open BlueStacks and click on the App Store icon that is located on the home screen. Once the App Store opens, search for "iOS emulator" and install the one that has the highest rating.

## Step 3: Sign in with Your Apple ID

The next step is to sign in with your Apple ID. This is important because without an Apple ID, you will not be able to download or use any Apple apps. So, click on the App Store icon again and sign in with your Apple ID details.

## Step 4: Download and Install the Apple Apps

With the iOS emulator and your Apple ID ready, you can now search for and download the Apple apps that you want to use on your PC. Simply go to the App Store, search for the Apple app you want, and click on the "Get" or "Download" button.

## Step 5: Run the Apple Apps on BlueStacks

Now that you have downloaded and installed the Apple apps on your PC, the final step is to run them on BlueStacks. To do this, open BlueStacks and click on the App Store icon or the Apple app icon on the home screen. The app will then open, and you can use it as you would on an iOS device.

In conclusion, running Apple apps on Windows 11 is no longer a dream but a reality. Thanks to BlueStacks and its iOS emulator, Windows 11 users can now enjoy Apple apps on their PC. Follow the guide above, and you will be downloading and using your favorite Apple apps in no time.

Apple has made available the “Devices” app as a preview, and in this guide, we’ll show you how to install it in two different ways.
 
On Windows 11, users still have to use iTunes to sync and restore data from iOS devices, such as iPhones, iPads, and iPods. The Apple Devices app is meant to replace these functionalities from the iTunes app. The new app offers the necessary features to back up devices, sync local media, and restore the device’s firmware.
 
Since this is a preview of the app not all features may work as expected. After installing the Devices app, the iTunes app will no longer open, and audiobooks or podcasts on your computer will be inaccessible until Apple releases a compatible version of iTunes.
 
If you want to revert back to iTunes, you will have to uninstall this version of the Apple Devices app.
