# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Analyze Your Entire Music Library in Windows Media Player! Find out now!

If you're a music lover or someone who likes to keep their music library clean and organized, you probably know the importance of having correct information about your music files.

But what if we told you that there's a feature in Windows Media Player that can make this task a whole lot easier? Yes, you read that right!

## Step 3 - Analyze Your Library

Now that you're in your music library, click on the "Organize" tab and select "Apply media information changes." This will prompt Windows Media Player to analyze your library and apply the correct information to all the music files in it.

Depending on the size of your library, this can take a few minutes to complete. However, once it's done, you'll be able to see that all the music files in your library have been updated with their correct information, including the album art, song title, artist name, and more.

## Step 4 - Enjoy Your Updated Library

Now that your music library has been organized and updated with the correct information, you can sit back and enjoy your music collection with ease. You'll be able to find the songs you want to listen to quickly and easily, and you won't have to worry about incorrect or missing information.

In conclusion, organizing and updating your music library has never been easier. With this built-in feature in Windows Media Player, you can have a clean and organized music library in no time. So go ahead and give it a try, we're sure you'll be amazed by how simple and efficient it is.

This article explains how to create a list of music for Windows Media Player using MediaInfo Exporter. Instructions apply to Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Select File > Open > Folder > choose folder > OK > View > Sheet. To export, select File > Export.Export playlists in a variety of formats including Word, Excel, Access, HTML, and Simple text.

 
##   Using the MediaInfo Exporter Tool  
 

The MediaInfo Exporter tool enables you to save a list of songs in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, Internet Explorer (HTML), and Simple text that can be opened with Notepad.

 

Once you've successfully downloaded and installed the app, it's time to create a catalog of your songs. To do this, run MediaInfo and follow these steps:

 
- Select File > Open > Folder.
 - Choose the folder containing the music you wish to catalog and select OK.
 - To view a list of songs, go to View > Sheet.
 - To export the list, go to File > Export (or press Alt+E).
 - Select the format you wish to export the file.
 - Choose where you want to save the file and filename under Choose your desired filename and select OK.

 
##   Why Create a Song Catalog?  
 

If you use Windows Media Player to organize your digital music library, you may want to catalog its contents. Keeping a record of the songs you have can come in handy. For instance, you might want to check if you have a song before purchasing it (again). Or, you need to find the songs you have by a band or artist. It's usually easier to use a text-based catalog than the search facility in WMP.

 

Select File > Open > Folder.

 

Choose the folder containing the music you wish to catalog and select OK.

 

To view a list of songs, go to View > Sheet.

 

To export the list, go to File > Export (or press Alt+E).

 

Select the format you wish to export the file.

 

Choose where you want to save the file and filename under Choose your desired filename and select OK.

 

However, Windows Media Player doesn't have a built-in way of exporting your library as a list. And, there's no print option, so you can't use the Windows generic text-only print driver to generate a text file.
