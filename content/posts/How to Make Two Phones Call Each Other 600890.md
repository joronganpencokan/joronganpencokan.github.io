### How Do You Deal with Prank Calls?
 
Below are a few ways you can use to deal with the prank calls you receive:
 
- Block Caller: If no one answers the call and no one says hello, it’s probably a prank call. It can also be one of those robocalls that telemarketers and fraudsters use to determine if a phone number belongs to a real person. The best course of action in this situation is to either hang up on your own or wait for them to do it. Eventually, block that number on your phone.
 - Stay Silent: Asking the individual their name is the easiest approach to determine if it is a hoax. It is obvious that the call is not real if the caller ignores your query or uses a fake identity that you are unfamiliar with. By remaining silent, you may turn the tables on this trickster, until they become irritated and hang up the call.
 - Ask Questions: Get the caller’s identity and the specifics of how you two met by asking for their name. There’s a strong chance that the caller is someone you don’t genuinely know if they can’t give you an accurate response.
 - Play Along: Make a date to meet up at an arbitrary location while playing along. If this individual is some lunatic or crazy and shows up at the spot, they will be rather angry when they find out they’ve been duped.
 - Report Caller: Threaten to report them if they claim you’ve won lottery tickets or other prizes. There is no chance you could have won anything if you didn’t participate in any contests or the said lottery. Unfortunately, a lot of individuals have been duped by dubious characters and have been the target of these phone calls.

 
### Can You Forward a Cell Phone to Another Cell Phone?
