When you need to reset, upgrade or replace your phone, one of the most important thing you should do is to backup all your accounts, apps, settings, and files. Windows Phone 8.1 comes with built-in tools that can help you to create a full backup very efficiently.
 
With Windows 10 out the door, Microsoft is also building a new version of its operating system for phones and many users are jumping in to try the preview. However, many users are failing to realize that because Windows 10 Mobile isn’t a finished product and has a lot of issues. Thus chances are that after a few days users may want to rollback to Windows Phone 8.1, and the only way to do that is by reinstalling the operating system, which will wipe out the phone. Therefore, if they don’t have a backup, all their data, settings, and apps will be gone.
 
Although, there is not a “make a full backup” button on any phone, Windows Phone 8.1 provides various options to backup everything on your phone to OneDrive, including Apps + settings, Text messages, and Photos and videos.
 
Below you’ll find the instructions to backup everything on your phone:
 
## Backup Apps & settings
 
Using the Windows Phone 8.1 backup tool, you can save your account passwords, call history, Start screen layout and theme color, Internet Explorer favorites, custom words you’ve added to your phone’s dictionary, apps installed in your phone, along with scores and progress from apps optimized for Windows Phone 8.1. Settings around your phone, including photos, messaging, email and accounts, lock screen, Speech preferences, and a lot more.
 
Before moving to any of the Windows 10 for phones previews, take a few minutes to make a backup of all your stuff by following these steps:
 
- Go to Settings > Backup

## Backup text messages
