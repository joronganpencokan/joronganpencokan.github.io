Mirroring (or flipping) a photo on your iPhone can be a great way to get a picture to look the way you want it to look. The Photos app on your iPhone and iPad can flip images with a few taps, or you can use a third-party app like Photoshop Express or Photo Flipper to mirror your images and add effects.

 - In the upper-left corner, tap the Flip icon. It looks like two triangles and has a line with two arrows pointing in opposite directions.
 - Select Done to save the flipped image. If you don't want to save it, choose Cancel > Discard Changes.

You can also use mirroring to improve an image's aesthetic or help a photo match the goals of a design project. As another example, what if a model is supposed to look to their left, but they're glancing to the right in all images? Mirroring the image fixes the problem without the need for reshoots.

 

The mirror effect also creates surreal imagery, such as a picture of someone looking at another version of themselves or the illusion of two objects being completely identical to one another within the same image.
