### How Many Followers Makes You Instagram Famous?
 
A few years ago, everyone would have advised you to pursue a career in acting or singing. But in the twenty-first century, it is possible to gain popularity and fans even if you are not a celebrity. People desire Instagram fame because it will allow them to become wealthy influencers. There are Instagram users who get income with just 5,000 to 10,000 followers. But it does not necessarily imply that they are famous on Instagram.
 
Cristiano Ronaldo with around 509 million followers is the most popular person in Instagram. Fret not! You need not have that many followers. Because in the opinion of most seasoned Instagram influencers, to be taken seriously as an authority in your domain, you need at least 30,000 followers. Aiming for 100,000 followers is a good idea if you want to become a popular person on Instagram. Now you know how many followers makes you Instagram famous.
 
### How to Make Celebrity Follow You on Instagram?
 
Let’s see a few ways you can implement to make celebrity follow you on Instagram.
 
Method 1: Tag Them in Post
 
The best way to start is to make something and tag them on Instagram. Whether it’s fan art or a post about them, anything that kind of expresses your motivation for them while also tagging them in the post could possibly elicit a response from them. I know what you’re thinking they must get tagged in thousands of things every day. What would your one tiny tag accomplish in contrast to all the others? At least you took a chance by being innovative there. Furthermore, people tend to remember inventiveness over a generic message.

Method 2: Be First one to Comment
 
So, here are some additional strategies that might help you get their interest and follow back. You need to take advantage of the fact that people are interested in other people’s perceptions of them. Therefore, if you arrive first at their comments, your chances of getting a response are better. You may always enable notifications for that celebrity so you will always be aware of when they post. Another general rule is to avoid using phrases like first in comments. Wow, or some other phrases don’t elicit a response.
 
Method 3: Be Significant in Comments
 
Write something significant instead because, if you’re asking a question or making a comment with real weight, chances are the celebrity will be moved by your message, respond to you, and possibly even follow you. Because most people genuinely like interacting with fans of their work and are ready to take some time out of their day to post comments and answer to them.
 
Method 4: Tag Their Friends
 
There are various methods you may employ to possibly catch their attention, but one that I would advise you to attempt is to tag the celebrity and their buddy on a post in the hopes that the friend would eventually respond to you because that elevates your message in the celebrity’s sight. Due to the notification coming from your friend and not just you, there are increased possibilities that they will see it. Aside from the fact that it will appear to be spam, I do not advise tagging everyone that person frequently converses with. However, make an effort to add some context. Keep reading for another method to learn how to make celebrity follow you on Instagram.
 
Method 5: Send Direct Messages (DMs)
 
Sending a direct message is another option. In this case, you could be a devoted follower while also being scary or stalker-like. As much as stars want to interact with their followers, they also have boundaries that should be observed, and a follower who is overly eager to follow can be going too far. The message should be carefully considered for your preferred celebrity.
 
You are attempting all of these techniques and advice, but nothing is working. Being ok with it in that situation is the best course of action. Be aware that celebrities require rest. Appreciate the fact that they do respond to fans considering they only have a brief window of opportunity to do so.
 
### How Can You Become Famous on Instagram?
 
So, Instagram is the best place if you want to get famous online. In fact, the Quintly analysis mentioned previously discovered that across all social media platforms, the channel’s follower growth rate is the highest. If I were to tell you that you could become famous on Instagram, you wouldn’t only have to follow famous people Instagram handles. Now you can also get included among the most popular person in Instagram, by following some tips mentioned below
 
Method 1: Define Your Specialization
 
You may be quite talented and have a wide range of interests, including those in literature, fashion, lifestyle, and fitness. Additionally, you are free to use Instagram to simultaneously produce content for each of these categories. However, if you want your content to be dependable and identifiable, the issue is that not everyone in your target audience will share all of these interests. And if you continue to produce content that is unrelated to their interests, you risk losing followers.
 
Method 2: Create Reels with Trendy Music
 
Reels are the first thing that comes to mind when we talk about being popular on Instagram. One of the things that makes you famous and helps you go viral in that way is Instagram reels. One thing you should keep in mind is that if you’re making a reel, you definitely want to be focusing on trendy music. It is strongly advised that anytime you make reels, use music from Instagram’s music collection rather than your own music because they are already popular. Therefore if you use them, you will undoubtedly increase the likelihood of your reel appearing.

Method 3: Post Everyday
 
Another suggestion I’d like to make is to post every day rather than not posting at all. Consider posting two to three times per day, two to three days per week, on your blog. For the remaining days, you may post once every day. Whatever you decide, be sure to continuously follow your schedule to keep existing supporters motivated and attract new ones. The fact is that posting consistently will increase your audience reach, reach overall, and follower growth. Read this article from the start to learn how to make celebrity follow you on Instagram.
 
Method 4: Use Hashtags
 
One amazing feature of Instagram is that you can use hashtags to reach the maximum audience and also tag famous people Instagram profiles for acknowledgment from their favorite celebrity. Play around with hashtags; you might have heard a variety of views about the optimal hashtag strategy for visibility. Others advise using as many hashtags as you can, while others may advise using fewer hashtags to prevent coming off as spammy. Attempt to simultaneously include as many pertinent hashtags as you can in some of your postings. Read this article from the start to learn how many followers makes you Instagram famous.
 
Method 5: Maintain Communication with Your Audience
 
You might follow certain accounts that never reply to your remarks. You might not hesitate to unfollow them at some point even though you have no animosity toward them. If they don’t even bother to interact with you, you won’t really feel a relationship. It is crucial for influencers to create enduring bonds with their followers because of this. The objective is to win their loyalty so that you don’t lose them as supporters. To demonstrate that you are paying attention to your followers’ remarks, spend some time replying to them.
 
Method 6: Be Careful While Including Call to Action
 
Keep in mind that Instagram is a conversational platform rather than a broadcasting one when including the call to action. After reading the piece, what do you want your followers to do? It encourages participation and makes clear what you want your team members to do. A call to action is a smart move that can encourage readers to interact with and share your material, so increasing its viral potential.
 
In the end, it’s a process; it’s not probable to post one piece of content that goes viral and makes you famous on Instagram. However, if you consistently take action and post great content, especially reels, you will see rewards over the long run, regardless of what. But be careful not to go overboard to avoid coming across as creepy to your favorite star.
 
Never abuse your approaches just because you now have an idea about how to make celebrity follow you on Instagram. Maintaining a healthy reputation is important because it can also result in your favorite celebrity suing you. Evidently, in order to become popular on Instagram, you need to have a particular number of followers. But you don’t need to worry about how many followers will make you famous on Instagram if your material appeals to your audience. Just take pleasure in the process and keep creating.
