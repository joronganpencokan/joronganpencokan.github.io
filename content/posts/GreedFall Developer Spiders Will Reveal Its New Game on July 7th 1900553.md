# Get Ready for the Ultimate Gaming Adventure! Greedfall Developers Spiders Unveil Their New Game on 7th July - Don't Miss It!

Are you ready for a gaming adventure that will take you to the depths of a mysterious island? If so, mark the date on your calendar - July 7th - because that is the day when Spiders, the developers of the critically acclaimed game Greedfall, are going to unveil their new game.

With just a few days until the official reveal, the gaming world is buzzing with excitement and speculation about what this new game could be. Some believe it's a sequel to Greedfall, while others think it's an entirely new IP.

One thing's for sure - Spiders has a reputation for delivering immersive and captivating gaming experiences that leave players hungry for more. Their previous games, including Bound by Flame and The Technomancer, have garnered a loyal fan following that's eagerly waiting for the studio's next release.

So what can we expect from Spiders' new game? Well, the studio has been teasing us with cryptic messages and trailers on social media, but they've been tight-lipped about the game's plot, mechanics, and setting. However, according to insiders, the game will be an action-RPG that combines Spiders' trademark storytelling with an open-world environment.

Rumors suggest that the game is set on a mysterious island, where the player will have to unravel the secrets of an ancient civilization and fight off hostile factions that are competing for power and resources. The game is said to feature multiple factions with their own agendas and beliefs, and the player's choices and actions will have consequences on the game's plot and ending.

If you're a fan of open-world RPGs that let you explore vast landscapes, engage in intense combat, and make meaningful choices, then Spiders' new game is definitely something to look forward to. The studio has a talent for creating immersive game worlds that are rich in detail and history, and the new game promises to be no exception.

So, mark your calendars for July 7th, and prepare for an epic gaming adventure that will transport you to a world of mystery, danger, and intrigue. With Spiders at the helm, we're sure it's going to be a journey worth taking.

As announced, the Greedfall developer Spiders will reveal their next game in the next week. We are dealing with the first project that results from the collaboration with BigBen Interactive.
 
As the organizer in the form of ESA decided to completely cancel this year’s E3 due to the COVID 19 crisis, the developers and publishers are betting on their own online events this summer.
 
These will be used to present completely new games or to present previously announced projects. As the Paris-based developer studio Spiders announced, they are currently preparing to announce a new project. The next game of Spiders will be unveiled on Tuesday, July 7th at 7:00 p.m CEST.
 
In recent years, Spiders has worked on titles such as Of Orcs and Men (2012), The Technomancer (2016), or Greedfall (2019). However, we should not count on sequels for these titles, as the trademark rights are owned by the publisher Focus Home Interactive, with whom Spiders has repeatedly worked in the past. However, in July 2019, publisher BigBen Interactive announced the acquisition of Spiders.
 
In the course of the corresponding announcement, BigBen Interactive formulated the goal of expanding its portfolio in the area of ​​role-playing games and securing a leading position in the area of ​​AA productions. Therefore, we can confidently assume that the next game of Spiders will again be an RPG or an action RPG.
