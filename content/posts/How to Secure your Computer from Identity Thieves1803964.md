Title: Protect Yourself from Identity Theft with These Simple Computer Security Tips!

Identity theft continues to be a growing concern for internet users today. With the advancement of technology, cyber threats have also become more sophisticated, making it more challenging to stay safe online. However, protecting yourself from identity theft isn't impossible. By following these simple computer security tips, you can significantly reduce the risk of becoming a victim of identity theft.

Use Strong Passwords and Change Them Regularly

One of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect yourself from identity theft is by using strong passwords. Your password is the key that unlocks all your online accounts, and if it's weak, it becomes easy for cyber criminals to access your sensitive information. To stay safe, use strong and unique passwords for each of your accounts. A strong password should be at least 12-15 characters long, including letters, numbers, and special characters. Also, make sure to change your passwords periodically, ideally every three months.

Be Wary of Phishing Scams

Phishing scams are another common tactic used by cyber criminals to steal your personal information, including your passwords, credit card details, and other sensitive data. Phishing is when hackers create fake websites or emails that look like legitimate ones to trick users into giving their personal information. Therefore, be wary of any email or website that asks for your personal information, especially if it looks suspicious. Always verify the authenticity of requests before sharing any information.

Keep Your Software Up-to-Date

Running outdated software is a recipe for disaster. This is because outdated software often contains security vulnerabilities that cyber criminals can exploit to gain access to your computer or steal your personal information. Therefore, keep your software up-to-date, including your operating system, web browser, antivirus software, and other applications. Software updates often contain security patches that fix vulnerabilities, making it harder for cyber criminals to exploit them.

Use Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts, making it harder for hackers to access them. With 2FA, you'll need to provide two forms of identification – usually a password and a unique code – before accessing your accounts. This way, even if a hacker manages to steal your password, they won't be able to access your account unless they have the unique code.

Final Thoughts

In conclusion, identity theft is a real threat, but there are simple steps you can take to protect yourself. By using strong passwords, being wary of phishing scams, keeping your software up-to-date and using two-factor authentication, you can significantly reduce the risk of becoming a victim of identity theft. Always stay vigilant when using the internet and don't take risks with your sensitive information. Remember, prevention is better than cure. Stay safe online!

HDD and Folder encryption means password-protecting your files, folders, or an entire drive. By using the passwords, you can easily encrypt the folders or the whole hard disk so that no one else can access the data inside them. Hence it becomes difficult to get any information out of them.
If anyone steals your HDD, you could feel safe, as there will be a password requirement to access the HDD content. Therefore you can remain sure that your account data if any is present inside it, is not available to the thief.

 
### 2. Two-Factor Authentication



These days, popular sites, apps, and services offer you a security feature called two-factor authentication. By using Two-factor authentication, you need to enter the authentication code sent to your registered phone number or email address to gain access to apps, accounts, or services.
Two factor greatly eliminates the risk of hacking attempts. Anyone who tries to break into your online accounts to use your identity will need to enter the verification code sent to your phone number to access the accounts.

 
### 3. Avoid saving passwords in Web browsers



Google Chrome does have a full-fledged password manager, but it’s recommended not to use it. If your laptop gets stolen, the thief can easily hack into your accounts, apps, and services due to the saved passwords.
So, it’s best to avoid saving the passwords in the web browser. Also, if possible, enter your details, like your bank account’s username & password, in Incognito mode.

What’s worse is that certain types of spyware can auto-run and install themselves. Once installed, these spywares or malwares silently work in the background to exchange information.
So, the best way to avoid such things is by using a proper anti-malware tool. You can use Malwarebytes, one of the leading security tools, to remove malware from your system.

 
### 6. Antivirus Programs



You should prefer to run antivirus programs in real-time, so they can continuously scan for any malware or spam links and addresses, protecting you from probable phishing hack attacks.

### 7. Network Protection



If you are working on any shared network connection, you should take the most care. You can increase the firewall strength, and the antivirus programs should always run to protect against any data loss through the shared network.
The data can be accessed through the shared network user if you are not using strong encryption on your connection, so be sure about the security strength to be utmost.

 
### 8. Use a Firewall



A firewall blocks unauthorized access to the computer while allowing you access to the web. The firewall feature comes inbuilt into Windows computers.
However, you need to make sure that you have enabled the firewall feature by going through Control Panel

Make sure to include numbers, non-alphabetic characters, and upper and lowercase letters on your password to make it more secure. Also, make sure to change the passwords once every 120 days.

 
### 11. Don’t Open Suspicious or unknown emails



Most identity theft occurs due to opening or replying to unknown emails. E-mail attachments are often used to distribute viruses and Trojan horses. Usually, these emails go to the junk folders, but certain emails make their way to the inbox.
So, the next time you find any suspicious emails from an unknown sender, don’t open them.
