Paint is an image editing app that has been part of Windows introduced the graphical user interface, and now Microsoft has built on a brand new version for Windows 10, which will also bring 3D to masses. Recently, the software giant has released an early preview of Paint 3D that give us a glimpse of the features we’ll be seeing with the Windows 10 Creators Update.
 
Paint 3D is a complete overhaul of the desktop version, and it’ll be part of the suite of apps Microsoft already ships with Windows 10, but if not, you’ll be able to download Paint from the Store.
 
## Paint 3D app is optimized for touch
 
Paint is now a touch-friendly app that also works well with a keyboard and mouse, and it includes 3D rendering support, which is something the app never had.
 
The current preview is not the final version, but it already shows impressive capability and design.
 
The app includes a canvas front and center with navigation bar on the top, and when you move between tabs, you will get access to the different features and tool on the right side.
 
## Paint 3D features
 
In the tools tab, you have access to the color picker and a number of different pencils, including marker pen, pixel pencil, oil brush, calligraphy pen, spray can, fill bucket, and more.
 
In the second tab, you can access all the 3D objects, models, and doodle you create your 3D project.
 
Additionally, when you create a 3D object in the canvas, you’ll see a short video highlight the steps to manipulate the object, which is very handy information for beginners.
 
From the Stickers tab you can access to a number of fun stickers, in addition to 2D shapes, textures, and you also get the option to add your own textures and stickers.
 
The Text tab simply lets you add 2D and 3D text with different fonts and the ability to change the background color.
 
The Backdrop tab lets you change the size of the canvas you’ll be working on with the option to show or hide the backdrop.
 
The Effects tab simply allows you to change the color accent of your project, which you can only pick from a handful of predefined effects.
 
Finally, there is also a Community tab, which you can sign in with your Microsoft account to access the Remix 3D community to share your creations with the world or download 3D projects that you can then make your own.

Then on the far right, there is a paste, undo, redo, and history button that allows you to quickly undo or redo all the changes.
 
This early version of Paint includes a hamburger button on the top-left corner to create new files, import or export 3D models, and print.

Even though the app is still under development, it’s impressive to see the new design and features Microsoft was able to bring. However, it’s far from complete, as it lacks of essential features you’ll find on other imaging editor software (Photoshop), such as layers or support to open more of one file at a time.
 
The Paint 3D app for Windows 10 feels like a basic image editor, but perhaps that’s exactly what Microsoft is trying to accomplish.
