# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Save Webpages in PDF on iOS 16 - Here's How!

Saving webpages in PDF format is a fantastic way to keep a permanent record of your favorite articles, tutorials, or even shopping carts. However, did you know that iOS 16 has made the task even easier? With just a few simple taps, anyone can save webpages in PDF on their iPhones or iPads. In this article, we'll show you how to do it in a matter of seconds. 

## Step 1: Open Safari and visit the Webpage You Want to Save

The first step in saving a webpage in PDF is to open your Safari browser and visit the page you'd like to save. Once you're there, tap the "Share" button in the screen's bottom toolbar. It's the square box with an upward arrow.

## Step 2: Select "Create PDF" from the Share Sheet

In the Share Sheet that pops up, scroll down until you see the "Create PDF" option. Tap it, and your webpage will now display as a PDF file. You'll notice that Safari has already done the work of creating a clean, concise PDF version of the webpage for you.

## Step 3: Customize the PDF File, if Needed

If you want to tweak the page's formatting to make it more easily readable or to remove any distracting ads or imagery, you can do so within the PDF file itself. Click on the pen icon in the top-right corner of the PDF screen, and you'll be taken to a markup interface. Here you can use your finger or a stylus to customize the page’s look however you choose it.

## Step 4: Save or Share the PDF File

Once you're happy with your changes – or if you don't need to make any – you can save and share the PDF file as you would any other. Tap the "Share" button in the screen's bottom toolbar again, and this time, select "Save to Files" from the Share Sheet. You can choose where to save the PDF (like in iCloud or Google Drive) and even rename the file if you want.

And that's it! That's how easy it is to save webpages as PDF on iOS 16. With this feature, you'll be able to keep all your favorite online articles at your fingertips, even when you're offline. So, start collecting your favorite webpages in PDF format today!
