With a host of new features and improvements, this update promises to enhance your user experience and make your device more versatile than ever. This is a significant step forward in the Android ecosystem, and it has the potential to change the way we use our tablets forever.

Body:

One of the most significant changes in Android 12 is its new design. The interface has been reimagined, with a focus on improving usability and enhancing accessibility.

One of the essential features is the privacy dashboard, which gives users more control over their data. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of how apps are accessing your data, and you can quickly revoke permissions for any app that you don't trust.

Google has also made significant improvements to notifications in Android 12. Notifications are now more interactive, allowing you to reply to messages and perform other tasks without leaving the notification shade. You can also filter notifications by the importance, making it easier to manage them.

In addition to all these features, Google has brought significant improvements to the performance and stability of Android 12. The update promises to make your device faster and more responsive, with smoother animations and better touch response. The battery life has also been improved, with the new update optimizing your device's power usage, making it last longer.

Conclusion:

All in all, Android 12 is a significant update that promises to revolutionize the way we use our Android tablets. With its new design, improved privacy features, enhanced notifications, and better performance and stability, this update has the potential to change the way we use our devices forever.

Google regularly updates its suite of productivity apps for Android phones, but year after year, many of these improvements skip tablets and foldables. 

 

Well, the tablet-side of Android is finally getting some love from Google, as many of the company’s productivity apps are receiving fairly substantial overhauls for those who prefer to work with larger screens. 

 

First up, Docs, Sheets, and Drive will get updates to support drag and drop, so you can pull texts and images from one app to another, helping to sustain a single ecosystem across all software. Google is beefing up Drive even further, adding the option to open up two files side by side. 

 

Keyboard shortcuts are also coming to Drive, Docs, and Slides, which is sure to please anyone who uses their Android tablet as a primary computer with a wired or Bluetooth keyboard. These include popular shortcuts like select, cut, copy, paste, undo, and redo, among others.

 

"Today, we are making Google Workspace apps even better on Android’s larger screens," Scott Blanksteen, Senior Director of Project Management, wrote in the post on The Keyword. 

 

These updates will roll out to Google Workspace accounts, and personal Google accounts over the "next few weeks." The company also says more improvements for Android tablets are forthcoming, though did not provide details. 

 

Why the sudden emphasis on tablets? It could be the company is simply listening to consumer demands, or they have a refresh inbound for the Google Pixel Slate. Another possibility is the ever-expanding foldables market, as Samsung recently announced that the company’s foldable devices had experienced a 300 percent increase in sales in 2021 over 2020.
