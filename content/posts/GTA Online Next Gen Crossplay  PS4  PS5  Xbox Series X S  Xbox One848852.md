Gaming has always been a significant source of entertainment, especially in the era of modern technology. With various gaming platforms and consoles available in the market, players are spoilt for choice when it comes to picking their preferred platform. However, the major challenge players face is the divide between platforms as players on a specific platform cannot play with others on a different platform. This hurdle is now being tackled by GTA Online, which has enabled crossplay between the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One gaming consoles.

The Grand Theft Auto franchise has been widely popular among gamers since its first release in 1997. The open-world nature of the game and the freedom for players to choose their own path have been the hallmark of the series. GTA Online is the online multiplayer version of the game, which was released in 2013, and since then has been a great success. But this game was always restricted to players on the same platform as crossplay was not an option.

The advent of next-generation consoles, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, has propelled crossplay further. These consoles offer better graphics, faster performance and allow players to immerse themselves in a realistic gaming experience. However, playing with other players on different platforms was still a major concern until the announcement of crossplay in GTA Online.

The inclusion of crossplay now offers players greater flexibility as it enables players to link with players on different consoles. With the game's extensive online multiplayer mode, players can team up across the console platforms, increasing the number of players, and thereby increasing the game's excitement. Crossplay brings the divided gaming community onto a single online platform, where players can showcase their gaming skills and form alliances with others.

However, some skeptics argue that crossplay could lead to cheating as players from different consoles may have varying levels of performance. But GTA has introduced measures to minimize this issue as it provides a level playing field by using the "Expanded and Enhanced" version, which will be optimized for new console hardware, ensuring the game runs smoothly and without hindrance.

In conclusion, the inclusion of crossplay in GTA Online is a game-changer for the gaming industry. It not only offers greater flexibility to gamers but also facilitates the merging of the gaming community, who can now play together on different consoles. This innovation will undoubtedly prompt other game developers to follow suit, leading to a more unified gaming experience for all players. Kudos to GTA and the developers for revolutionizing the gaming industry!

GTA Online is best played with friends, but what if you have a PS5 but your friends play on PS4 – can PS5 players play GTA Online with PS4 players? What about those who have Xbox One – can they play with those having Series X|S? Find out if there is cross-play between PlayStation and Xbox consoles for GTA 5 Expanded & Enhanced as well.
 
## Can PS5 players play GTA online with PS4 players?

The answer is no. If you have bought the GTA 5 Expanded & Enhanced (next-gen) version for the PS5, you cannot play with friends who have the original GTA 5 game on PS4. In case you purchase the original game on PS5, then you can play with other players who have a PS4. This has some cons, of course, because you won’t be getting the next-gen experience despite having the next-gen console.
 
## Can Xbox Series X|S players play GTA Online with Xbox One players?
 
No, if you have the GTA 5 Expanded & Enhanced version on Xbox Series X|S, you cannot play with others who are using the Xbox One console. But, similar to PS, you can download the original game made for the Xbox One on your Series X|S and crossplay with players who have the previous-gen consoles.
 
## Can PS5 players play GTA Online with Xbox Series X|S players?
 
The answer is no, PlayStation 5 players cannot play GTA Online with Xbox Series X|S players. Whether this feature will be added in the future is yet to be seen.
