Revamp Your PC's Font Game: Here's How to Install Fonts in the All-New Windows 11!

Windows 11 has arrived, and it marks a significant update to the classic operating system that we know and love. Windows 11 introduces new features and improvements, and one of the most sought-after additions is the possibility to install new fonts easily.

Fonts are an essential part of your computer experience. They can make your documents, presentations, and social media posts look professional and eye-catching, and they can also make your computer experience more enjoyable overall. If you're tired of using the same standard fonts in Windows 11, you're in luck. Here's how to revamp your PC's font game by installing new fonts in the all-new Windows 11!

Step 1: Find the Right Font

Before you install a new font, you need to make sure you've got the right one. There are thousands of fonts available on the internet, so you'll need to narrow down your search. Some popular font websites include Google Fonts, Font Squirrel, and DaFont. Browse these sites and find a font that suits your needs. Once you've found the right one, download it to your computer.

Step 2: Unzip the Font File

Most font files come in a compressed zip file. To access the font file, you'll need to unzip or extract it first. Simply right-click on the compressed file and select "extract all." This will create a new folder with the font file inside.

Step 3: Install the Font

Now that you've downloaded and extracted the font file, it's time to install it. Follow these simple steps to install the font in Windows 11:

Step 1: Open the font file location

Step 2: Right-click on the font file and select "Install."

Step 3: Wait for the installation process to complete.

That's it! Your new font is now installed and ready to use in Windows 11.

Step 4: Use your New Font

Once your new font is installed, you can start using it in your favorite applications. Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, and other applications all recognize newly installed fonts. Simply select the font from the font list and start typing. You can also change the font settings in Windows 11 to make your new font the default.

To change the default font in Windows 11, follow these steps:

Step 1: Open the Settings app.

Step 2: Click on Personalization.

Step 3: Click on Fonts.

Step 4: Click on the font you want to set as the default.

Step 5: Click on the "Set as default" button.

That's it! You've changed the default font, and all new documents will now use your new font by default.

Conclusion

Installing new fonts in Windows 11 is a simple process that can completely change the look of your computer experience. By following these steps, you can easily install new fonts and start using them in your favorite applications. Whether you want to create professional documents or make your computer experience more fun and enjoyable, installing new fonts in Windows 11 is a great way to revamp your PC's font game.

This article explains how to install fonts in Windows 11. You can get the font file yourself from the web or use Microsoft Store to locate and easily install new fonts. We'll also cover how to delete fonts you don't want anymore.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Right-click the font file and choose Install.Drag the file into Settings > Personalization > Fonts.Search Fonts in Microsoft Store, choose Get on font page.

 
##   How Installing Fonts Works in Windows 11  
 

Font files are like regular files, where they can be downloaded from websites and shared between computers via flash drives, CDs, etc.

 

There are lots of places to get fonts online, including free sources like Google Fonts, DaFont, and FontSpace. We'll see below Windows 11 has its own, built-in method for getting fonts, too.

 

If you've got a font file, like one in the OTF or TTF file extension, you can't just put it anywhere on your computer and expect it to be usable. A font isn't recognized by Windows 11, and by extension programs like Word, until it's been properly installed.

 

Installed fonts are stored in a specific folder, as covered below. As long as the program you want to use the font in is looking for font files in the standard Windows Fonts folder, following the steps below will allow the file to be used by that software.

 
##   How to Install Fonts From the Web  
 

Here's what to do with the file you've downloaded so you can start using the font in your programs:

 
- Locate the font file. You need the actual file, so if the font was downloaded in an archive (it probably was), extract it first: Select it once and then go to Compressed Folder Tools > Extract all > Extract. The font will appear in a folder by the same name as the archive.
 - If your font downloads within an archive file, it's most likely a ZIP file. However, if it's something else like 7Z or RAR, you'll need a third-party file extractor tool to open it. Once you get the true font out of the archive, the rest of these steps apply just as they do with ZIP fonts.
 - There are several ways to install a font in Windows 11. The easiest is to double-click it, or right-click it, and select Show more options > Install.
 - You can also go to Settings > Personalization > Fonts, and drag the font file into the area at the top. This works with multiple fonts as well.
 - Font installations can also take place directly from the Windows Fonts folder at C:\Windows\Fonts. Copy and paste, or drag and drop, one or more fonts there to install them in bulk.
 - If none of these methods work, verify you've dealing with the actual font and not the archive it came in. If Windows 11 doesn't recognize the font you have, try to convert it to a supported format.

 
##   How to Install Fonts Through Microsoft Store  
 

Another way to get fonts is through Microsoft Store. Instead of searching for a trustworthy website to get fonts from, and then having to download the file yourself, Windows 11 has a built-in method which streamlines the whole process.

 

Locate the font file. You need the actual file, so if the font was downloaded in an archive (it probably was), extract it first: Select it once and then go to Compressed Folder Tools > Extract all > Extract. The font will appear in a folder by the same name as the archive.

##   How to Delete Fonts in Windows 11

Go to Settings > Personalization > Fonts > Get more fonts in Microsoft Store.
