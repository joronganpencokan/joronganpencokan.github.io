# Horizon Forbidden West Release Date Pushed Back AGAIN - Fans Devastated for 2022 Release!

Horizon Forbidden West fans have been eagerly anticipating the game's release for months now, but the wait just got longer. Sony and Guerrilla Games recently announced that the game's release, which had already been pushed back once, has been pushed back again, this time to 2022.

The news has left fans devastated, with many taking to social media to vent their frustrations. The original release date for Horizon Forbidden West was late 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic caused delays. Then, the release was pushed to 2021, before being delayed again to early 2022.

The latest pushback marks a shift in Sony's strategy for game releases, prioritizing quality over meeting a deadline. In a statement, Hermen Hulst, Head of PlayStation Studios, explained that the team at Guerrilla Games needed more time to deliver the best possible experience to fans.

"We know many of you have been waiting patiently for Horizon Forbidden West, and the team at Guerrilla is working hard to bring you a game that lives up to our collective ambitions," Hulst said. "However, we also want to ensure that the team has enough time to polish the experience to the level of quality players expect from a Horizon game."

While the news is disappointing for fans eager to continue their journey with protagonist Aloy, it's important to remember that delays can ultimately result in a better gaming experience. The original Horizon Zero Dawn was acclaimed for its groundbreaking visuals, intricate world-building, and captivating storylines. If a delay ensures that Horizon Forbidden West meets, and even surpasses, those standards, then it will be worth the wait.

The delay announcement also came with a bit of good news – Sony has confirmed that Horizon Forbidden West will be available on both the PlayStation 4 and the new PlayStation 5 console, giving players more options for where and how to play the game.

Ultimately, it's clear that Guerrilla Games and Sony are committed to delivering a game that exceeds fan expectations, even if that means pushing back the release date. As painful as it may be to wait another year, fans can take comfort in the fact that the end result will likely be an unforgettable gaming experience.

So, while the wait for Horizon Forbidden West might be longer than expected, it will undoubtedly be worth it in the end. Keep holding on, fans – the journey with Aloy will continue soon enough.

Could the action role-playing game Horizon Forbidden West developed by Guerrilla Games also be one of the titles that will be delayed to the coming year due to the COVID-19 pandemic? At least that’s what an insider suggests.
 
In the past few weeks, it has already become apparent that the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated restrictions will also affect numerous games and their release period in 2021.
 
Various ambitious projects such as Gran Turismo 7, Overwatch 2, Hogwarts Legacy or Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 have been delayed to 2022 in the recent past. If we believe the Russian insider Anton Logvinov, then Guerrilla Games’ action role-playing game Horizon Forbidden West could also be one of the titles that will see the light of day in the coming year.
 
When it comes to the Horizon franchise, the insider Anton Logvinov has predicted correct information about the title. The fact that he was the first to confirm the PC version of Horizon: Zero Dawn – and that several weeks before it was announced by Guerrilla Games or Sony Interactive Entertainment.
 
Despite everything, his information should of course be used with the necessary caution for the time being. However, a postponement to the year 2022 could not be ruled out, as the corona crisis and the move to the home office are also likely to cause problems for the developers of guerrilla games.
 
Should the Dutch studio or Sony Interactive Entertainment comment on the current rumors about the possible Horizon: Forbidden West release in 2022, we will of course bring you up-to-date information immediately.
 
Hopefully, we will soon find out what it all means in practice.
