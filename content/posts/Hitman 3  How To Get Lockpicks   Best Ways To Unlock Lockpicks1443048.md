The Ultimate Guide to Unlocking Lockpicks in Hitman 3 - Become a Master Assassin Today!

Are you feeling frustrated with locked doors, safes, and cabinets in Hitman 3? Do you want to explore every nook and cranny of the game's levels and find hidden treasures? Then you need to unlock lockpicks, the essential tool for any stealthy killer in this game. In this article, we'll show you how to obtain and upgrade lockpicks and use them to your advantage.

First, let's get the basics out of the way. Lockpicks are one of the most useful gadgets for any Agent 47 who wants to avoid detection, steal valuable items, or access restricted areas. With a lockpick in hand, you can open most doors, cabinets, and safes without alerting guards, cameras, or bystanders. However, not all lockpicks are created equal. There are three types of lockpicks in Hitman 3, and each one has its pros and cons.

The first type of lockpick is the basic lockpick, which can open most locks in the game. You start with one at the beginning of the game, and you don't need any specific skill or item to use it. However, the basic lockpick is slow and loud, meaning it takes a few seconds to open a lock and makes a noticeable noise that nearby NPCs can hear. You also can't use it while crouching or in a compromised state, which limits its usefulness in certain situations.

The second type of lockpick is the advanced lockpick, which is faster, quieter, and more versatile than the basic lockpick. You can unlock it by completing some challenges in the game or purchasing it with mastery points. The advanced lockpick can open most locks like the basic one, but it's much faster, taking less than a second to open a lock. It's also quieter, making it almost impossible for NPCs to hear you, even if you're standing right next to them. Finally, you can use it while crouching or in a compromised state, which makes it a valuable tool for any stealthy assassin.

The third type of lockpick is the electronic lockpick, which is the most advanced and rarest lockpick in the game. You can only obtain it by completing a few specific missions or purchasing it with mastery points. The electronic lockpick can open any electronic lock or keypad in the game, which gives you access to some areas that are otherwise impossible to breach. It's also silent, fast, and can be used while crouching or in a compromised state. However, it has limited uses, and you need to recharge it after a few unlocks, which can be inconvenient in some situations.

Now that you know the three types of lockpicks in Hitman 3, let's talk about how to obtain and upgrade them. To unlock the basic lockpick, you need to complete the first mission of the game, which is a tutorial level that teaches you the basics of stealth, disguise, and assassination. Once you finish the tutorial, you'll have a basic lockpick in your inventory for the rest of the game.

To unlock the advanced lockpick, you need to complete some challenges in the game or purchase it with mastery points. Mastery points are rewards that you get for completing missions, discovering new locations, and accomplishing specific objectives. You can use mastery points to upgrade your equipment, abilities, and unlock new items in the game. To unlock the advanced lockpick, you need to spend some mastery points in the "Tools" category, which will unlock the lockpick upgrade menu. Once you unlock the advanced lockpick, you can switch between it and the basic lockpick in your inventory by pressing the gadget button.

To unlock the electronic lockpick, you need to complete some specific missions or purchase it with mastery points. The electronic lockpick is the rarest lockpick in the game, and you need to put some effort into obtaining it. However, it's worth the investment, as it can open some areas that are otherwise impossible to reach. Once you obtain the electronic lockpick, you can switch between it and the other lockpicks in your inventory by pressing the gadget button.

To use a lockpick in Hitman 3, you need to approach a locked door, cabinet, or safe and select the lockpick from your inventory. Then, you need to press and hold the gadget button to start the unlocking process. The longer you hold the button, the more progress you make towards unlocking the lock. However, if you hold the button for too long, the lockpick will break, and the lock will remain locked. You need to find the sweet spot between speed and precision to avoid getting discovered by nearby NPCs.

In conclusion, unlocking lockpicks in Hitman 3 is essential if you want to become a master assassin. With the right lockpick in hand, you can open most locks in the game and access hidden areas, stolen items, and valuable intel. Whether you prefer the basic, advanced, or electronic lockpick, make sure to upgrade them and use them wisely to avoid detection and complete your objectives. Happy unlocking!

In Hitman 3 you will miss out a lot behind locked doors like some cool pathways and different tactical kills. Although you can use a crowbar, they will be noisy and NPCs will be suspicious about you. So crowbars can’t be used always when there is NPC within a hearing range or while in NPC’s view. Unlocking the lockpick is the best way to be the true “Silent Assassin”. Let’s look at how to get lockpicks in Hitman 3.
 
## How to Get Lockpicks in Hitman 3
 
The best and easiest way to unlock lockpicks in Hitman 3 is to carry over your progress from Hitman 2. But if you are new to Hitman World of Assassination trilogy then you can unlock lockpicks from Dartmoor’s Mastery Level 2. This won’t take that long into the game. But carrying your progression from Hitman 2 allows you to use your unlocked lockpick from the previous game, right from the moment you start Hitman 3.
 
You can complete various challenges in Hitman 3 to earn XP, which in turn can be used to level up in Mastery Level and collect the rewards. The same can be done with the Dartmoor map – once you reach Mastery Level 2, you can unlock Lockpick MK III. This version functions exactly like a normal lockpick, but this has cosmetic differences and matches with other MK III gears you will unlock in the game ahead.

 
You can equip lockpick in Hitman 3 before starting a mission from the Planning tab, select it in Gear tile. Once you start the mission, Agent 47 will be carrying a lockpick in his inventory.
 
You can use a lockpick to open any analog doors and safety deposit boxes containing many functional items. All electronically locked doors will need keycards to unlock them. Once near a locked door press Y on Xbox, hold triangle on PS to use lockpick.
