Title: You won't believe how this guide to LCD TVs will revolutionize your viewing experience!

Introduction:

If you are someone who loves to watch movies, TV shows, or play video games, then a high-quality LCD TV is a must-have in your living room. Nowadays, almost every household has an LCD TV, and owning one has become an essential part of our daily lives. However, with so many options available in the market, choosing the right LCD TV that can revolutionize your viewing experience can be quite a daunting task. Hence, in this article, we are going to provide you with a comprehensive guide on how to choose the perfect LCD TV that suits your needs and preferences.

Body:

1. Understand the basics of LCD TVs: 

Before diving into the buying process, it's crucial to understand the fundamentals of LCD TVs. LCD stands for liquid-crystal displays, and it is one of the most common display technologies used in televisions today. LCD TVs use an array of liquid crystals that are sandwiched between two polarizing filters to produce images on the screen. The backlighting technology behind LCD TVs has improved tremendously over the years, enabling sharper colors and brighter images.

2. Determine the screen size: 

The screen size of an LCD TV is measured diagonally from corner to corner. If you have a small room, then it's recommended to choose a 32-inch or 40-inch TV, whereas for larger rooms, a 50-inch or 60-inch TV is ideal. However, the larger the screen size, the more expensive it gets. So, choose the screen size that fits your budget and room size.

3. Resolution is important: 

The resolution of a TV refers to the number of pixels on the screen. The more pixels, the sharper the image quality. Full HD TVs have a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, whereas Ultra HD (4K) TVs have a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels. If you can afford it, go for a 4K TV as it offers a more immersive and lifelike viewing experience.

4. Consider the refresh rate: 

The refresh rate refers to the number of times the image on the screen is refreshed per second. The higher the refresh rate, the smoother the motion on the screen. A refresh rate of 60Hz is sufficient for most users, but if you are an avid gamer, then a higher refresh rate of 120Hz or more is recommended.

5. Check the HDR compatibility: 

HDR (High Dynamic Range) is a technology that offers improved color accuracy, brightness, and contrast on the screen. It enhances the overall viewing experience and makes the colors more vibrant and lifelike. Thus, it's recommended to choose an LCD TV that is HDR compatible.

Conclusion:

Choosing the perfect LCD TV that suits your needs and preferences can be a challenging task. However, by understanding the basics of LCD TVs, determining the screen size, taking into account the resolution, refresh rate, and HDR compatibility, you can choose an LCD TV that revolutionizes your viewing experience. So, what are you waiting for? Use this comprehensive guide and buy the perfect LCD TV for your living room today!

LCD flat-panel televisions, with their decreasing price points and performance improvements, are now the dominant type of television sold. However, how much do you really know about these TVs, and are these your only choice? The following guide unveils the facts about LCD TVs that you need to know.

 
##   What Is an LCD TV?  
 

An LCD TV is a flat panel television that uses the same LCD (liquid crystal display) technology found in cellphones, camcorder viewfinders, and computer monitors.

 

LCD panels are made of two layers of a glass-like material, which are polarized and glued together. One of the layers is coated with a special polymer that holds the individual liquid crystals. Electric current is passed through the individual crystals, which allows the crystals to pass or block light to create images.

 

LCD crystals do not produce light. An external light source, such as fluorescent or LED light bulbs, is needed for the image created by the LCD to become visible to the viewer.

 

LCD TVs can be made very thin, allowing them to be hung on a wall or placed on a small stand on top of a table, desk, dresser, or cabinet.

 

LCD TV technology is resolution agnostic. In other words, LCD TVs can display a variety of resolutions, from 480p up to 8K, and, in the future, even higher depending on how TV makers want to provide consumers.

 
With some modifications, LCD technology is also used in video projectors.
 

It is also important to note that LCD TVs display images progressively.

 
##   LCD and LED  
 

When shopping for a new TV, you will encounter many TVs labeled as LED TVs.

 

The LED designation on a TV refers to the LCD TV's backlighting system, not the chips that produce the image content. LED TVs are still LCD TVs. These TVs use LED backlights rather than the fluorescent-type backlights of most other LCD TVs.

 
##   LCD and QLED  
 

LED isn't the only label that can be confusing with regards to LCD TVs. Another label that you might encounter is QLED, which is used mostly by Samsung and TCL. Vizio, on the other hand, uses the term Quantum.

 

These labels refer to TVs that use quantum dot technology to improve color performance. Quantum dots are an added layer of nano-sized particles, placed between an LED backlight and the LCD display layer in an LCD TV.

 

The dots are clustered in different sizes, with each size producing a specific color range when hit by the light from LEDs. The result is richer colors that can be displayed on an LCD TV screen, especially images at higher brightness levels.

 
##   LCD and OLED  
 

Although LCD is the core technology used in most TVs, there is a type of TV which is not a variant of LCD, OLED.

 

OLED TVs use a technology that consists of self-emitting pixels (similar to the now-discontinued plasma TV tech). It uses less energy and can be made almost paper-thin.

 

Each pixel can be turned on and off individually, allowing OLED TVs to produce absolute black and more brilliant colors than either plasma or LCD. However, the main drawback is an overall lack of brightness. LCD TVs can produce higher brightness levels.

 
##   LCD and Plasma  
 

LCD and plasma TVs share one thing in common. Both are flat and thin and can be wall-mounted. However, inside those thin cabinets, these TVs employ different technologies to display images for TV viewing.

 

Plasma TVs use pixels made of self-emitting phosphors (a backlight isn't required) to produce images. The advantage over LCD TVs is that each phosphor can be turned on and off individually, producing deeper blacks.

 
Although plasma TVs have been discontinued, there are still many in use.
 

On the other end, plasma TVs can't produce images as bright as an LCD TV. In addition, plasma TVs are subject to burn-in if a static image is displayed on the screen for too long a time period. 

 
##   Video Frame Rate vs. Screen Refresh Rate  
 

When shopping for an LCD or LED/LCD TV, you will hear terms like 60 Hz, 120 Hz, 240 Hz, MotionFlow, ClearScan, and more. What does this mean, and is it important when considering the purchase of an LCD or LED/LCD TV?

 

Those numbers and terms refer to how an LCD TV can handle motion. Although LCD TVs can produce bright, colorful images, one problem these TVs had from the outset is that the motion response isn't that natural. Without some enhancement, fast-moving images on LCD TVs can exhibit lag or jerkiness.

 

Over the years, several technologies have been employed that have improved things to varying degrees.

 

One option is to increase how often the screen refreshes the image on the screen. For example, 60 Hz means that the screen refreshes 60 times a second, 120 Hz refreshes at 120 times a second.

 

Other techniques are also used, such as blacklight scanning (flashing the backlight at a high rate) and frame interpolation (inserting black or intermediate frames between each actual frame).

 

The technique used varies depending on the brand and model of TV.

 
##   Before You Buy an LCD TV  
 

Before you purchase an LCD TV, in addition to the core technologies discussed above, there are other things to take into consideration so that a specific brand and model is right for you.

 
- Screen size and seating distance: TV screen sizes are getting larger. If you're thinking about getting a big screen TV, make sure it will fit in your room and look good at your seating distance.
 - Viewing angle: One weakness of LCD TVs is the relatively narrow viewing angle. You get the best results at the center seating position and good results within 30 to 45 degrees on either side of the center spot. However, as you move farther to either side, you'll notice picture fading and color shifting. OLED and plasma TVs are less prone to this problem.
 - Flat screen or curved screen: Although not as numerous as they were a few years ago, Samsung still makes a limited number of curved-screen TVs. Still, there are things to consider, such as susceptibility to room glare and viewing angle.
 - Connections: Depending on the brand and model of the TV, the type and number of connections may vary. Generally speaking, you can connect both an old VCR and the latest Blu-ray Disc player. If you have older analog gear (such as a VCR or DVD player without an HDMI connection), there are a growing number of TVs (both LCD and OLED) that may have limited options.
 - Smart TV: Most LCD TVs are equipped with some smart features. This allows you to stream content, such as Netflix, directly to your TV without an external device, provided the TV is connected to the internet.
 - HDR: HDR is available on some LCD and OLED TVs. This feature allows you to view content that is specially coded with enhanced brightness information.
 - Sound options: All LCD TVs come with built-in speakers, but the sound quality is often not good. If the sound quality isn't satisfying, connect the TV to an external sound system, such as a soundbar or a home theater audio system. All LCD TVs, except for some with small screen sizes, can connect to an external audio system. Most have analog and digital connection options. Still, depending on the brand and model, only the digital connection option may be offered.
