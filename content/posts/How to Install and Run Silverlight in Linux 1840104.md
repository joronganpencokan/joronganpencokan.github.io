Finally Revealed: The Foolproof Way To Install Silverlight in Linux in Just 5 Easy Steps!

Silverlight is a popular web application framework formerly developed by Microsoft. It enables users to create rich internet applications and multimedia experiences with advanced user interfaces. Unfortunately, Silverlight is not available on Linux by default. However, if you need to use Silverlight on Linux, you can do so by installing a compatible browser and then installing the Silverlight plugin. Here's how you can do it in just five easy steps:

Step 1: Install a Compatible Browser

The first step to installing Silverlight on Linux is to ensure you have a compatible browser. Here are some browsers that are compatible with Silverlight:

• Firefox
• Google Chrome (version 45 or below)
• Midori
• Safari

Note that Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, and the new Microsoft Edge based on Chromium are not compatible with Silverlight on Linux.

Step 2: Install Pipelight

Pipelight is a browser plugin that lets you use Silverlight on Linux. To install Pipelight, follow these steps:

• Open a Terminal window.
• Type "sudo apt-get install pipelight-multi" (without the quotes).
• Press Enter.
• Wait for the installation to finish.

Step 3: Install the Silverlight Plugin

Now that you have Pipelight installed, you need to install the Silverlight plugin. Follow these steps:

• Open a Terminal window.
• Type "sudo pipelight-plugin --enable silverlight" (without the quotes).
• Press Enter.
• Wait for the installation to finish.

Step 4: Restart Your Browser

Once the installation is complete, you need to restart your browser. Close all instances of your browser and then reopen it.

Step 5: Test Your Installation

To test whether Silverlight is working properly on Linux, visit a website that uses Silverlight, such as Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. If you're able to watch a video or use a Silverlight-based application, then your installation was successful!

In conclusion, if you need to use Silverlight on Linux, you can do so easily by following these five easy steps. With the right browser and the right plugins, you can enjoy all the rich multimedia experiences that Silverlight has to offer. So give it a try today and see for yourself how easy it is to install Silverlight in Linux!

Love it or hate it, we all know Flash, but Microsoft’s equivalent, Silverlight, is a bit less well known. With Silverlight you can stream video and create animations, in fact you can even use it to create Windows sidebar widgets. However, in what may come as a bit of a shock, Microsoft Silverlight doesn’t play nice with Linux. I know, I know, it’s hard to believe, but true. To remedy this, the folks at the Mono project have created Moonlight – an open source implementation of Silverlight.  If you find yourself wanting to access a Silverlight-only broadcast or game, but not wanting to install a second operating system for the privilege, we’ve got you covered.

 
## As a Package
 
If you”re running a distribution that’s already got a Moonlight package, you’re in luck. Ubuntu Lucid Lynx has the package, and it can be installed through the Ubuntu Software Center or with the command line:
 
This will install the Moonlight plugin for Firefox along with the core components.  
 

 
## As a Plugin
 
If your distribution doesn’t have a Moonlight package, you can manually install it as a browser plugin. The Moonlight Download Page provides a link for the Linux plugin install. For best performance, make sure you select the proper CPU type.  
 
## Testing Your Installation
 
Once installed through either method, you will of course want to test your installation to verify that Moonlight is working. For that I recommend a simple website called BubbleMark. It’s a test animation designed to draw bubbles using various web technologies like Flash and Silverlight. You can select which software platform and its version, and BubbleMark will attempt to draw a series of moving, colliding bubbles on the screen. You can run the same animation in several formats to determine what gives you the best performance.  
 
## Fun with Silverlight
 
Now that everything’s up and running, it’s time to have some fun with our new plugin. The following are a few locations where you can find some great Silverlight/Moonlight software and games.  
 
- Silverlight.net – the official page. Contains demos, games, tutorials, the works
 - SilverlightGames.org – A great place to find loads of Silverlight games
 - SilverlightClub.com – Mostly games, including a pretty good tower defense

 
## Conclusion
 
While Silverlight itself is tied to Microsoft, Moonlight provides a way to access this functionality with open source software. Currently the platform is not hugely popular, and it’s possible it may be phased out altogether as HTML5 becomes more common, but for now Moonlight is our best bet to get this functionality on Linux.
