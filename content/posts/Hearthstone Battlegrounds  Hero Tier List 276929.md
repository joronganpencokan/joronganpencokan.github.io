# Unleash Your Inner Pro with the Ultimate Hearthstone Battlegrounds Hero Tier List!

Are you tired of struggling to progress in Hearthstone Battlegrounds? Are you tired of always ending up in the bottom half of the leaderboard? Fear not, because we have the ultimate solution to help you unleash your inner pro and climb up the ranks.

The solution is simple: use the best heroes available in Hearthstone Battlegrounds. In this article, we present to you the ultimate hero tier list that will help you dominate in every match you play. But first, let's understand the concept of hero tiers.

Hero tiers refer to the overall power level of a hero in a game. In Hearthstone Battlegrounds, heroes have unique hero powers and starting decks that give them an edge over their opponents. Some heroes are stronger than others, and therefore, they belong to the higher tiers.

Now that we've established the importance of hero tiers let's dive into the ultimate Hearthstone Battlegrounds Hero Tier List:

## Tier 1: The Best of the Best

1. Ragnaros the Firelord
2. The Lich King
3. Millificent Manastorm
4. Yogg-Saron, Hope's End
5. Deathwing, Mad Aspect

These heroes are the cream of the crop and bring a tremendous amount of power to their respective strategies. Ragnaros the Firelord is the strongest hero in the game and has the highest win rate across all tiers. The Lich King's hero power is incredibly strong, and Millificent Manastorm is an excellent hero for Mech builds. Yogg-Saron, Hope's End, and Deathwing, Mad Aspect, can be devastating in the late game.

## Tier 2: Strong Heroes

6. A. F. Kay
7. Alexstrasza
8. Queen Wagtoggle
9. Sindragosa
10. Toki, Time-Tinker

These heroes are strong, but not as strong as Tier 1 heroes. A. F. Kay can be a powerful hero when played correctly, and Alexstrasza's hero power can provide a significant advantage in combat. Queen Wagtoggle is an excellent hero for Beast builds, and Sindragosa can hold her own with the right minions. Toki, Time-Tinker's hero power can give you a random minion with a higher tier, which can help with your overall strategy.

## Tier 3: Average Heroes

11. George the Fallen
12. Jandice Barov
13. Patchwerk
14. Reno Jackson
15. The Great Akazamzarak

These heroes are average and provide no significant advantage over the other players in the game. George the Fallen's hero power can be useful for Divine Shield builds, and Jandice Barov can provide some flexibility with her hero power. Patchwerk is a slow starter, but his hero power can be useful in the late game. Reno Jackson's hero power can provide some healing, and The Great Akazamzarak has a random secret that can come in handy.

## Tier 4: Weak Heroes

16. Bartendotron
17. Dr. Boom
18. Fungalmancer Flurgl
19. Rafaam, the Supreme Archeologist
20. Shudderwock

These heroes are weak and provide no significant advantage over the other players in the game. Bartendotron's hero power can be useful in the early game, but he's not a hero that will carry you to victory. Dr. Boom can be useful for Mechs, but his hero power is not as strong as other hero powers. Fungalmancer Flurgl is decent for Murloc builds, but there are stronger heroes in the game. Rafaam, the Supreme Archeologist's hero power steals a minion from your opponent's board, but it's not as strong as other hero powers. Shudderwock's hero power is random and can be a hit or miss.

And there you have it, the ultimate Hearthstone Battlegrounds Hero Tier List! Remember, if you want to climb up the ranks and unleash your inner pro, you need to choose a hero from Tier 1 or Tier 2. Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor!
