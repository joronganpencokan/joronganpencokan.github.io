At the start, you need to choose the right combination of skill points that will help you reach your goal. For instance, if you want to be proficient in combat, you need to choose physical attributes such as strength, agility, and endurance, along with combat-oriented skills such as melee combat, firearm proficiency, and evasion.

2. Explore the World

Greedfall is set in a vast world filled with hidden treasures, quests, and enemies. By exploring the game's world, you will discover new locations, interact with non-player characters, and gain a better understanding of the game's story. By accepting quests and completing them, you will be rewarded with XP and valuable items that can help you level up faster.

3. Engage in Combat

Combat is an integral part of Greedfall, and engaging in it presents opportunities to earn valuable XP bonuses. Fighting enemies and completing missions requires skill, strategy, and mastery. To defeat enemies quickly, you need to choose weapons that you are comfortable with and take advantage of your character's abilities. You can also level up your combat skills by using them in combat and unlocking new techniques.

4. Craft and Upgrade Items

Crafting and upgrading items is another way to earn XP fast in Greedfall. As you progress through the game, you will gather resources that you can use to create new items. Crafting new items or upgrading existing ones will help you gain XP, increase your character's proficiency, and provide you with additional combat and survival equipment.

5. Use Save Points Strategically

Save points are essential in Greedfall, as they allow you to save your progress and continue where you left off. However, save points can also be used strategically to farm XP. Before embarking on a mission, you can save the game and complete the mission. If the mission rewards you with XP, you can save the game again and repeat the mission. By doing this, you can farm XP quickly and level up faster.

Conclusion

By following these tips, you can unleash your full potential in Greedfall and level up quickly. Remember that the game is about making smart choices, exploring the world, engaging in combat, crafting and upgrading items, and using save points strategically.
