What is a Mac Dashboard?

The Mac dashboard is a feature that allows you to access widgets, small applications that perform specific tasks, quickly from your desktop. Widgets are designed to provide easy access to information on various topics, from weather reports to news feeds. With the dashboard, you can customize your desktop to display the information you need without having to open a separate application.

This feature is particularly useful for web developers who need to monitor their website's activity regularly. Additionally, the dashboard will save you time by providing you with real-time updates, so you won't have to keep refreshing your browser manually.

Step 3: Search for the "WebClip" widget or "Webpage" by typing it into the search bar.

Step 4: Drag the widget to your desktop and release it.

Step 5: A pop-up window will appear where you can type in the URL of the website you want to track.

Step 6: Click on "Add" in the lower-right corner of the window.

Step 7: The new widget will appear on your desktop, displaying the website you added. If you want to track multiple websites, repeat steps 3-6.

Step 8: Click on the "i" button on the bottom-right corner of the widget to access the widget's settings.

Do you use the dashboard on your Mac? Many Mac users find the dashboard pointless and don’t use it at all. Others only use it every now and then when they happen to remember that it’s there.
 
One of the coolest widgets on the Mac dashboard is the Web Clip widget. With this widget, you can clip any part of a Web page in Safari via the “open in dashboard” option. This is a great way to monitor changes to any Web page(s) that you choose; whenever the page changes/updates, so will your widget.
 
If you need to check a Web page regularly for changes, just use the Web Clip widget. Unfortunately, you can’t interact with the widget, but it’s an excellent monitoring tool. Best of all, you can create numerous Web Clip widgets to monitor various websites.
 
1. To get started, you’ll have to open Safari and browse to the Web page that you want to monitor.
 
2. Go to the “File” menu and down to “Open in Dashboard.”
 

 
3. The page will darken and you’ll need to select the part of the Web page that you want to monitor, and then click on the “Add” button at the top of the page.
 
4. Once clipped, you’ll be sent to the dashboard and your Web Clip will load.
 
5. If you click on the little information icon in the bottom right corner of the widget, you can change the theme of the widget; there are 5 others to choose from.
 
Now all you have to do is check the widget whenever you like to see if there have been any changes to your Web Clip. See, the dashboard isn’t so useless after all!
