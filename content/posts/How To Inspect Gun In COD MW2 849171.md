# Master the Game with this Ultimate Guide on How to Inspect Your Gun in COD MW2!

If you're a fan of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, you know how important your weapons are for your gameplay. When it comes to dominating the battlefield, maintaining your guns is crucial. The simple act of inspecting your guns can help you spot and resolve any potential problems before they become major issues. By following this ultimate guide on how to inspect your gun in COD MW2, you can ensure that you're always armed and ready for action.

## Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with Your Gun

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of inspecting your weapon, it's important to have a thorough understanding of its parts and functions. As you progress through the game, you'll become more familiar with the various guns you can use. You should also learn about the attachments your weapon can support, such as scopes and suppressors.

Knowing your gun inside and out will help you identify any issues that may arise and allow you to make quick repairs in the field.

## Step 2: Clean Your Gun

Every time you complete a mission or finish a multiplayer match, take the time to clean your weapon. This is especially important if you've been using it heavily throughout gameplay.

To clean your gun, simply access the Armory and select your weapon. From here, you can use the "Clean Weapon" option to keep your gun in top shape. It only takes a few seconds, but it can make all the difference when it comes to accuracy and damage output.

## Step 3: Inspect Your Gun for Damage

As you play COD MW2, your gun will invariably take some damage. You can inspect your weapon for damage by selecting it in the Armory and choosing the "Inspect Weapon" option.

Here, you can get a close-up view of your gun and see if there are any visual indicators of damage. Look for cracks or scratches on the barrel, any missing parts or attachments, and general wear and tear.

If you notice any damage, take note of it and make repairs as soon as possible.

## Step 4: Inspect Your Gun for Proper Function

During gameplay, your gun may develop performance issues that can impact your ability to compete. Inspecting your weapon is an excellent way to spot and address these problems.

To check the functioning of your gun, select it in the Armory and choose the "Function Test" option. This test will help you determine if your weapon is working correctly or if it needs any repairs.

## Step 5: Make Repairs as Necessary

If you notice any damage or problems during inspection, it's important to make repairs as soon as possible. This will help you maintain your weapon and avoid any further issues.

You can repair your weapon by accessing the Armory and selecting the "Repair Weapon" option. This option will allow you to fix any issues and get back to playing the game without any problems.

By following these five simple steps, you can master the game and stay armed and ready for action in COD MW2. Inspecting your gun regularly is key to keeping your weapons in top shape, so be sure to take the time to check your guns before and after every mission or match. With a little bit of effort, you'll be dominating the battlefield in no time.

## How to Inspect Your Weapons in COD MW2
 
It is a pretty simple mechanism that involves only a single keybind. But it depends on the supported platform and the input device you are using. So, if you are using a Controller, hit the left directional key to inspect your weapon. For the players using the keyboard and mouse, hit the I key button. This will trigger the inspect animation that will give you a detailed look. It will allow you to take a look at the equipped weapon from all angles.
 
But we suggest not inspecting your equipped weapons in the middle of the match. You need to find a hidden or safe spot to inspect your weapons. Also, avoid pressing the inspect weapon keybinds in the heat of the match. As the animation triggers, this might be the reason for the enemies to take a shot. So, make sure not to accidentally press the inspect weapon keybinds.
