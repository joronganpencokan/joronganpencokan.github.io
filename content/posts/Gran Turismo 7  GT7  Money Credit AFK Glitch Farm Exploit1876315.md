You Won't Believe How Players are Raking in Millions of Credits on GT7 While AFK!

Gran Turismo 7 is one of the hottest racing games of the year, captivating players with its exclusive rides and adrenaline-fueled gameplay. For the uninitiated, the simulation-based game challenges players to participate in a range of races, events, and challenges, with the ultimate goal of becoming the champion racer. Along the way, the game rewards players for skillful driving and consistent racing, allowing them to amass credits that can be used to purchase new cars and upgrades.

However, some players have discovered a secret technique that allows them to earn millions of credits while AFK, without even touching the controller. For those wondering how this is possible, it’s all thanks to the game’s peculiar Pit Stop feature.

In GT7, Pit Stops are locations where players can repair their cars, change their tires and refuel them. However, unlike other racing games, Gran Turismo 7 allows players to simulate the pit stop process, letting players rest their controllers while the game completes a full pit stop sequence. This process takes about 30 seconds to complete, and players can earn 500 credits in each successful pit stop.

So, what’s the secret technique that allows players to earn millions of credits while AFK? The answer is simple: automate the pit stop sequence. By automating the pit stop process, players can continuously repeat the process without any interference, earning up to 2,500 credits every two minutes. 

The trick to automation is using mobile apps that allow you to stream GT7 to your mobile device, and it’s on this device that you’ll set up the automation. Apps like the Remote Play app for PlayStation, and programs like OBS Studio for PC, allow players to create a series of macro commands that simulate the pit stop process. These can be activated using hotkeys, allowing players to repeatedly earn credits without any intervention.

It’s important to note that while the pit stop automation technique is an easy way to earn credits, it might not be completely legal. As with any third-party apps or software, players should exercise caution and use automation at their own risk.

In conclusion, the automation of the pit stop process is a sneaky and potentially illegal way of earning credits in Gran Turismo 7. While it might be tempting to use the technique to boost your in-game earnings, it’s important to remember that your account might be banned or flagged for suspicious activity. So, use the technique at your own discretion, and don’t be surprised if you don’t gain any credits as a reward for being sneaky.
