Title: You Won't Believe it: Apple's M2 Mac Pro Release Delayed and Manufacturing to be Moved out of the US According to Gurman!

In a surprising move, sources close to Apple have revealed that the company has delayed the release of its highly anticipated M2 Mac Pro and plans to move its manufacturing out of the US. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the company has faced several setbacks, including supply chain disruption and production challenges that have led to the delay.

This news will undoubtedly come as a blow to Apple fans who have been eagerly awaiting the release of the M2 Mac Pro, which was expected to be an upgrade from the M1 and designed specifically for professional users. The new model was expected to feature a more powerful processor, more advanced graphics card, and an improved cooling system.

However, the company's plans to move manufacturing out of the US have raised concerns among those who advocate for domestic production and keeping jobs in the country. Apple had previously pledged to invest heavily in US manufacturing, with former CEO Tim Cook saying in 2019 that the company planned to support 2.4 million jobs in the US by 2020.

But the recent announcement from Gurman suggests that Apple may be rethinking its commitment to domestic manufacturing. The move, if true, could be due to several factors, including lower labor costs and a desire to diversify its production base.

Of course, this news is still unconfirmed, and Apple itself has not released any official statement on the matter. So it remains to be seen whether the M2 Mac Pro will be delayed and whether manufacturing will indeed be moved out of the US.

But if this news is true, it raises some important questions about the future of domestic manufacturing and the role of technology companies in shaping it. It also reinforces the challenges that companies face when trying to balance profitability with social responsibility, as well as the importance of transparency in corporate decision-making.

In conclusion, while the news of the M2 Mac Pro delay and plans to move manufacturing out of the US may be disappointing to Apple fans and industry observers alike, it also offers a chance to reflect on the broader issues of domestic production and the role of technology companies in driving economic growth. We will have to wait and see how this story unfolds, but one thing is certain - it underscores the need for all companies to be mindful of their impact on society and to strive for responsible and sustainable practices.

Apple users still have a while to wait to get their hands on the long-rumored M2-equipped Mac Pro.

 

The ultra-high-end desktop computer has been delayed for several reasons, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. The report indicates that Apple is designing a brand-new, next-generation M2 Ultra chip for the computer.

 

As this is a high-end product, expect some beefy specs. Bloomberg suggests the model will boast up to 24 CPU cores, 76 graphics cores, and 192 GB of RAM.

 

However, this is less powerful than what was previously assumed, as older reports suggested that the Mac Pro’s chipset would include up to 48 CPU cores and 152 graphics cores. This is likely a cost-cutting measure for consumers, as the more advanced specs would push the computer into the $10,000 range. 

 

Another reason for the delay? It looks like Apple is moving manufacturing away from Texas to Vietnam. Current Mac Pro models are finalized in Austin, though the main internal components have always been made in China. In other words, the parts will continue to be built in China, with the final assembly moving to Vietnam. 

 

Bloomberg also notes that Apple is likely manufacturing new M2-equipped Mac Mini variations, with updated MacBook Pros arriving early next year. Unfortunately, the refreshed Apple Silicon iMac Pro also faces similar delays to the Mac Pro. 

 

Apple is continuing in the monitor space, according to the report, including an update to the Pro Display XDR and “multiple new external monitors.” These monitors are all expected to be powered by Apple Silicon chips.
