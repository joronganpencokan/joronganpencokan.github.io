# Unleash Your Inner Skater: Master The Hubba Gap Nosegrab In THPS 1 & 2 With Our Expert Guide!

Skateboarding is not only a sport, but it's also a way of life. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (THPS) has been giving us the experience of skateboarding virtually for over two decades. The release of THPS 1 & 2 in 2020 has revived the love for the game amongst the millennial skaters. The competitive spirit of the game keeps players coming back to beat their score and master new moves.

One such move is the Hubba Gap Nosegrab. It is a trick that requires skill, balance, and accuracy. In this article, we'll guide you through the steps to become a pro at this trick in THPS 1 & 2.

## Understanding The Hubba Gap Nosegrab

The Hubba Gap Nosegrab is a combination of three different tricks: Nosegrab, Ollie, and Kickflip. It involves jumping off from a raised surface, grabbing the nose of your skateboard while performing an Ollie and a Kickflip mid-air, and landing back on the skateboard. The Hubba Gap is a famous trick in skateboarding, where skaters jump from one edge of a rail to another while grinding down.

## Step By Step Guide To Master the Hubba Gap Nosegrab

Step 1: Choose a skater that suits your playing style- if you're someone who prefers balance over speed, skaters like Tony Hawk or Riley Hawk could be your choice. If you're quick and prefer to cover ground fast, skaters like Andrew Reynolds or Lizzie Armanto could be your preference. 

Step 2: Select the level where you want to perform the trick. You need a level that has a Hubba Gap rail or a ledge with a gap in it. We recommend you try the Marseille level.

Step 3: Start by gaining speed towards the Hubba Gap rail. Once you've reached optimal speed and are close enough to the rail, start jumping towards the rail while performing an Ollie.

Step 4: Once you're in the air, grab the nose of the skateboard and perform a Kickflip mid-air. Make sure you time these moves perfectly, or your skater will fall.

Step 5: Land back on your skateboard after you've performed the Kickflip, and keep steady as the board lands on the rail. Make sure you manage your balance as you grind down the rail to complete the trick.

Mastering the Hubba Gap Nosegrab in THPS 1 & 2 can be challenging, but it's not impossible. The trick needs patience, timing and accuracy to nail it.
