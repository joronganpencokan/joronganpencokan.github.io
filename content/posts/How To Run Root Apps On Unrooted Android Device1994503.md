Root apps are applications that require root access (or administrative access) to your Android device. These apps have access to system files and settings that regular apps do not have. This allows them to perform a variety of advanced functions that are not otherwise possible.

For example, some root apps can help you modify system settings, delete bloatware, increase battery life, and more. They can also give you access to blocked features or settings in some apps.
