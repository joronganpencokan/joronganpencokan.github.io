# Unlock the Secrets of Hitman 3's Medium Rare Challenge - Become a Stealth Assassin Master in Just a Few Clicks! 

Are you tired of bumbling around and scaring off your target in Hitman 3? Are you looking to become a stealth assassin master? Look no further, as we unveil the secrets behind the Medium Rare Challenge in Hitman 3.

## What is the Medium Rare Challenge? 

The Medium Rare Challenge is a mission in Hitman 3 that requires the player to assassinate two chefs named Bobby and Mooney in a Dubai hotel kitchen. The catch? There are no disguises available, so the player must rely solely on their stealth and deception skills to accomplish the objective. 

## How to Ace the Medium Rare Challenge 

Step 1: Scout the Area 

The first step to mastering the Medium Rare Challenge is to scout out the area. Familiarize yourself with the layout of the kitchen, the locations of the targets, and the habits of the guards. Take note of any useful items you can find, such as knives or poisons. 

Step 2: Disguise Yourself 

While there are no disguises available in this challenge, there is still a way to blend in with the chefs. Head to the staff locker room and take a chef's outfit. This will allow you to move around the kitchen without raising suspicion. 

Step 3: Create Diversions 

To distract guards and chefs, use your environment to your advantage. For example, you could turn on a radio to create noise, throw a can to make a sound, or even cause a small explosion to draw attention away from you. 

Step 4: Get Creative 

There are many ways to take out your targets in the Medium Rare Challenge. Some of the most effective methods include poisoning their food or drinks, throwing knives at them, or even creating accidents such as explosions or electrocution. However, be careful not to get caught, as the guards will be on high alert for any suspicious activity. 

Step 5: Escape 

Once you have successfully eliminated both targets, it's time to make your escape. Head back to the locker room and change back into your original outfit, then find a discrete way to exit the hotel. 

## Final Thoughts 

The Medium Rare Challenge may seem daunting at first, but with the right tactics and a little bit of patience, anyone can become a stealth assassin master in Hitman 3. So go ahead and give it a try - who knows, you might just surprise yourself with your own ingenuity and resourcefulness.
