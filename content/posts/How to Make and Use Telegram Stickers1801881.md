Telegram is a popular messaging app available on iOS, Android, Windows 10, and the web. The app focuses on security and privacy and has garnered a loyal following among those interested in technology. The everyday person also uses it to communicate with family and friends and connect with others with similar interests.

 
##   How Does Telegram Work?  
 

Telegram is similar to Facebook Messenger and other texting apps. You can send your contacts text messages, web links, or images and join groups to communicate with numerous people at the same time. What sets Telegram apart from its rivals is its stickers, which can be customized and made by anyone for free.

 
##   How to Create Telegram Sticker Packs  
 

Unlike other platforms that limit chat sticker creations to paid sponsorships or require a lengthy approval process, Telegram lets anyone create sticker sets in the official Telegram apps and publish stickers live for all users to use.

Creating Telegram sticker packs is free and there's no limit to the number of stickers within each pack.

 - The Stickers chatbot asks you to associate the PNG file with an emoji. For example, if the sticker has a happy face, you may want to use the happy face emoji. Enter the emoji, and press Enter.
 - Upload the second PNG file and assign it a unique emoji. Continue with all of your PNG files.
 - After you enter your Telegram stickers, type /publish, and press Enter.
 - The Stickers chatbot asks you to select an image to function as the promo artwork for your Telegram sticker pack. If you want, type /skip to use the first PNG file you uploaded or upload another file.
