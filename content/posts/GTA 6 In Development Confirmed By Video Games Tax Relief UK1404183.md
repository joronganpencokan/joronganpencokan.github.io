This is a massive statement from Rockstar Games, and it is clear that the developers are looking to push the boundaries of what is possible in the gaming industry.

The news is not entirely unexpected, as rumors about GTA 6 have been circulating for a few years. However, there has been no official confirmation from Rockstar Games until now. The announcement has left gamers excited and eager to learn more about the game.

So, what are the details that we know so far about GTA 6? Here is everything you need to know:

Rockstar Games has given a significant budget to the development of GTA 6. Although the exact number has not been confirmed, rumors suggest that it is the biggest budget for a video game in history. This shows the level of investment Rockstar Games is willing to put towards the development of the game to make it the best that it can be.

**The location**
GTA games are known for their massive open-world environments, and GTA 6 is no exception. The game will take place across multiple cities in the US, including Vice City, Liberty City, and San Andreas. This is a departure from the previous iteration, which was set in a fictional version of Los Angeles known as Los Santos.

**The storyline**
The storyline for GTA 6 is not yet known, but rumors suggest that it will be centered around drug trafficking and will follow the story of an up-and-coming drug lord. This aligns with the theme of previous GTA games, which have explored the criminal underworld.

**The release date**
There is no official release date for GTA 6 yet, and it is unlikely to be released until 2022 or even 2023. Rockstar Games has a reputation for taking its time with the development of games, and it is clear that they want to ensure that they get it right with the much-awaited release.

**The platforms**
The game will be available on the next-generation consoles, including the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. It is not yet clear if the game will be available on the current generation of consoles or on PC.

In conclusion, the announcement of GTA 6 is a significant development in the gaming industry, and it is clear that Rockstar Games is looking to push the boundaries of what is possible with this release. The game's massive budget, multiple locations, and storyline centered around drug trafficking are all exciting prospects for gamers worldwide.

The development of GTA 6 has been rumored for quite some time now but it looks like the confirmation about this has come from the most bizarre places of all. It looks like Rockstar North filed for a significant increase in its claims for Video Games Tax Relief with HMRC in the UK for 2018/2019.
 
The claims got approved on the bases that the project is Culturally British, this allows game developers to seek large subsidies for high-cost productions with cultural ties to the UK.
 
The CulturallyÂ  British clause, basically means that the British Film Institute verifies that the game was written and produced by the people of England and that the project is in English. This lets game developers get subsidies from the British government.
 
Last Year, the voice actor for Trevor in GTA V said that GTA 6 should not be more than a year or two away from being released. Take-Two Interactive has also been pushing for an early release for GTA 6 and hoping to have more frequent releases.
 
Everything about this sounds exciting it looks like we could get more information about the next installment in the GTA series sooner than expected. While GTA V was released in 2013, Rockstar North has since then been focused on GTA Online which is still growing strong every day.
 
It is certain that we will have more information about GTA 6 as the year progresses and we will keep updating as soon as more information is leaked. Until then, make sure that you check out other news and guides only on GamerTweak.
