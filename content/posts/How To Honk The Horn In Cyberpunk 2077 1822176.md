Rev Your Engines: The Mind-Blowing Trick That Will Take Your Cyberpunk 2077 Honk to the Next Level!

Cyberpunk 2077 is the latest and most anticipated action role-playing video game, set in a dystopian future of Night City. With its immersive gameplay, breathtaking graphics, and intriguing storyline, it has already taken the gaming world by storm. One of the standout features of Cyberpunk 2077 is its unique driving mechanics, which boasts an impressive array of cars available for players to customize and drive.

However, there is one aspect of driving in Cyberpunk 2077 that many players may overlook - the power of the honk! That's right, the humble horn on your car can be a powerful weapon in the world of Night City. In this article, we will explore some tips and tricks to make your honk stand out and take your driving game to the next level.

Firstly, let's talk about the basics of honking in Cyberpunk 2077. You can honk your car's horn by pressing the left stick button on your controller (or the "H" key on your keyboard). This will sound your car's horn, alerting NPCs and other players to your presence. On the surface, this may seem like a simple feature, but used correctly, your honk can have a significant impact on your gameplay.

The first tip for honking in Cyberpunk 2077 is to use it to clear the road ahead of you. Many NPCs and cars will block your path, and in some cases, they may not move out of the way. By honking your horn, you can signal to other drivers to get out of your way, making it easier to navigate through the busy streets of Night City. Additionally, honking your horn can also signal to pedestrians to move out of your way, preventing you from accidentally hitting them.

Secondly, honking can be a great way to intimidate your opponents. Whether you're competing in a street race or trying to take down a group of enemies, honking your car's horn can give you an assertive edge. It signals to your opponents that you mean business and can even give you a psychological advantage. Additionally, honking can act as a distraction, causing opponents to lose focus and potentially making it easier for you to win the race or defeat your enemies.

Lastly, honking can be a great way to communicate with other players in the game. With the game's expansive multiplayer mode, communicating with other players can be key to your success. By honking your car's horn, you can signal to other players to follow you or to warn them of upcoming dangers in the game. Additionally, you can use your honk to show off your car's customized horn sound, which is a unique feature of Cyberpunk 2077.

In conclusion, honking in Cyberpunk 2077 is an underrated feature that can significantly improve your gameplay experience. By using your honk to clear the road, intimidate your opponents, and communicate with other players, you can take your driving game to the next level. So rev your engines, and let your honk be heard in Night City.

You will have to learn how to honk the horn in Cyberpunk 2077 for one of the side missions titled “Send in the Clowns.” One of the objectives of this side quest is to “wait for Ozob.” However, only waiting won’t do the job for you. You will have to honk the horn and indicate to Ozob that you have reached the spot. Hence, we are here with this guide on how to honk the horn.
 
## Cyberpunk 2077 – How to Honk the Horn
 
Press left CTRL on PC or L3 on the controllers to honk the horn in Cyberpunk 2077. These are the default keys for honking. However, the key to honk the horn on PC might differ if you would have made changes to the default key binding. If you don’t remember any such thing but aren’t able to honk with the left CTRL button, you can easily check the assigned key from the menu.
 

 
All you need to do is go to the menu and head to the Key Bindings option. This will open the screen with all the actions and the keys that are assigned to them. Look for the “Horn” option under the “Vehicle” category to check the key bound for honking. Once you find out the key, either change it if you want to or press the key while in the game to honk the horn.
 
To change the key, simply select the horn slot and then press the key that you want to assign for honking. Once your selected key appears on the screen, press the “Apply” button to confirm the changes.
 
That’s everything you need to know about how to honk the horn in Cyberpunk 2077. If you want to rebind every key according to your preference, you will have to do it from the files as the game does not allow you to change all the keybinds from the menu.
