Crit Rate is an important stat in Tower of Fantasy that many players want to increase. But while you can see that stat, there is also another separate stat known as Crit. And both of these work to affect your critical damage, but are not the same. So in this guide let us check how to increase the Crit rate in Tower of Fantasy (ToF), and what critical damage is.
 
## How to Increase Crit Rate in Tower of Fantasy
 

 
As of now, there is no way for players to increase Crit Rate in the game, they can instead increase Crit damage. So while you cannot increase this stat directly what you can do is use items that boost Crit. For example, when you equip the item Vanguard gloves, it increases your Base attack by 35 and Crit by 82. The important thing to remember here is it increases your Crit and not Crit rate. So while the critical damage does improve, it isn’t necessarily going to increase the Crit rate.

### How are Crit Rate and Crit Different
 
The main difference between the two is one is the chance of an attack hitting critically and other is the damage the attack does.
 
Crit rate or Critical rate is the percentage that decides whether your next attack will do critical damage. The higher the percentage the better chance you have of dealing critical damage. Meanwhile, the Crit or Critical damage is actually the extra damage the move does. For both of them the higher the number the better.
 
As of now the known ways to improve Crit is by using items like Vanguard gloves, Explorer’s gloves, and more. Or you can use Mind matrices with your weapons. You can start getting these matrices from level 20.
