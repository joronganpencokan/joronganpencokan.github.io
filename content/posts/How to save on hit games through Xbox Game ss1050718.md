# Unveiled: Insider Secret To Get Your Hands On Latest Hit Games At Amazing Prices Only Through Xbox Game Pass

If you're a gaming enthusiast, you're probably already aware of Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass - a subscription service that lets players access a vast library of games for a monthly fee. But did you know that the service also offers a way to get your hands on the latest hit games at amazing prices?

Here's what you need to know about this insider secret:

## The Basics of Xbox Game Pass

First, let's start with the basics: Xbox Game Pass is a subscription service that gives players access to a library of over 100 games. The service costs $9.99 per month, and you can cancel or pause your subscription at any time.

The games in the library are frequently updated, so you can expect to see new games added every month. You can also purchase any of the games in the library at a discounted price - usually around 20% off.

But the real deal comes in the form of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

## Xbox Game Pass Ultimate

Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is a subscription service that combines Xbox Game Pass for both console and PC, Xbox Live Gold, and an EA Play membership into one package. This means you get access to even more games, as well as online multiplayer and exclusive discounts on games and add-ons.

The cost of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is $14.99 per month, but you get much more bang for your buck than just subscribing to Xbox Game Pass or Xbox Live Gold separately.

## The Insider Secret

Now, here's where the insider secret comes in: Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members get access to new games on the day they're released.

That's right - instead of paying $60 for a new game when it's released, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members can simply download it through the service on release day.

Not only does this save you a ton of money, but it also means you can play the latest hit games right away without worrying about stock shortages or waiting for delivery.

## Example of Savings

To give you an idea of how much you can save with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, let's look at the recent release of "Outriders" - a highly anticipated co-op shooter.

At the time of writing, "Outriders" is available for purchase on Xbox for $59.99. But if you're an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate member, you can download the game on release day for no additional cost.

That's a saving of $59.99 right off the bat. And if you decide to purchase the game after playing it through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you'll also get a 20% discount - bringing the price down to $47.99.

## Conclusion

If you're a gaming enthusiast who loves to play the latest hit games, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is an absolute must-have. With access to new games on release day and exclusive discounts on games and add-ons, you can save a ton of money while also getting the best gaming experience possible.

So, if you haven't already, be sure to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and start reaping the benefits today!
