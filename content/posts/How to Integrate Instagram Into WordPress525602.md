A strong online presence can make or break a business, and one of the best ways to achieve this is through social media marketing. Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms, with over 1 billion active users. Integrating Instagram into your WordPress site is one of the best strategies for boosting your online presence.

Why Integrate Instagram into Your WordPress Site?

WordPress is one of the most popular content management systems (CMS) in the world, with over 60 million websites using it. By integrating Instagram into your WordPress site, you can make your site more dynamic and engaging. Here are some of the benefits of integrating Instagram into your WordPress site:

1. Increased Engagement: When you integrate Instagram into your WordPress site, you can increase engagement with your target audience. Instagram is a visual platform, and by displaying your Instagram feed on your WordPress site, you can show your audience what your brand is all about.

2. More Social Media Exposure: By displaying your Instagram feed on your WordPress site, you can increase your social media exposure. This can help you to gain more followers, likes, and comments on Instagram, which can translate into increased website traffic, leads, and sales.

3. A More Dynamic Site: Integrating Instagram into your WordPress site can make your site more dynamic and visually appealing. This can help to keep visitors on your site for longer, reducing bounce rates and increasing the likelihood of conversion.

How to Seamlessly Integrate Instagram into Your WordPress Site

1. Choose a Plugin: The first step to integrating Instagram into your WordPress site is to choose a plugin. Some popular options include Instagram Feed, Smash Balloon Social Photo Feed, and WP Instagram Widget. Each of these plugins has unique features, so it's important to choose one that fits your needs.

2. Install and Activate the Plugin: Once you have chosen a plugin, you need to install and activate it. To do this, go to the plugins section of your WordPress dashboard and click "Add New." Then, search for the plugin you want to install and click "Install Now." Once the plugin is installed, click "Activate" to activate it.

3. Configure the Plugin: After activating the plugin, you need to configure it. This may involve connecting your Instagram account to the plugin or setting up the display options for your Instagram feed.

4. Add the Widget or Shortcode: Once the plugin is configured, you can add the Instagram widget or shortcode to your WordPress site. The location and method for doing this may vary depending on the plugin you chose. In general, you can add the widget or shortcode to a sidebar or footer widget area, or to a specific page or post.

Instagram is really popular, but it is mostly restricted to your mobile devices. What if you want to view it online or add it to your WordPress blog? Here is how you can do it.
 
## insta.SHOW
 
insta.SHOW is a WordPress plugin that allows you to display a running slide show of the images in your Instagram account. You need the Instagram login info of the account you’d like to display. The configuration options let you choose the number of images to display, the size of the text and the size of the images. Anywhere you’d like to add the slideshow, you can insert the shortcode “[instagram]” and the slide show will be added.
 

 
## Instapress
 
Instapress is a more full featured Instagram plugin for WordPress. Instapress gives a lot of different options to add your Instagram images to different places in your site. You can add them as a widget, in a post or a page or even add it as part of your WordPress template.
 
The widgets and shortcodes can be configured to better suit your needs. What’s nice about Instapress is you aren’t limited to your own Instagram account feed. There is the choice to show other peoples feeds, popular feeds or even images with a specific tag.
 
When you have the Instagram images show up in a blog post as a gallery, images can be clicked on and enlarged. This is great for showing all the pictures from an event.
 
## Instagrate to WordPress
 
Instagrate to WordPress has a feature a little different than what the others on the list offer. The big deal here is, you can configure Instagrate to WordPress ahead of time and then go out and take pictures. When you use Instagram to capture a moment in time, the new picture will be published as a new blog post. Having this kind of plugin will save you a ton of time. You won’t need to take the image, attach it to a blog post then publish it, you can automate the process.
 
One of the fears I had was not wanting every single Instagram image show up as a blog post.  In the settings, it is possible to have the default post be set as a draft instead of publish automatically.
 
## Final thoughts
 
For a personal site or even if you travel places for the work, adding in images to show where you’ve been really helps people connect with you. Adding a running slide show to your websites sidebar or posts displaying your recent Instagram images can be a simple way for you to add content to your site too.
