# Discover the Secret to Unlocking the Ultimate Meditation Ability in Spiritfarer!

Meditation is an essential part of Spiritfarer, a game that takes players on a mystical adventure through the afterlife. It is a way to connect with the spirit world, and unlock abilities that can help the player complete tasks and uncover the game's secrets.

The ultimate meditation ability in Spiritfarer is the ability to teleport to any location in the game. It is a powerful tool that can save players time and effort, but unlocking it requires a bit of effort and patience.

Here's how to unlock the ultimate meditation ability in Spiritfarer:

Step 1: Find the Meditation Shrine

To unlock the ultimate meditation ability, you first need to find the Meditation Shrine. It is located on the Island of Meditation, which is east of Oxbury. The island is available from the start of the game.

Step 2: Unlock the Shrines on the Island of Meditation

On the Island of Meditation, there are three shrines that players must unlock. Each shrine requires a different ability, which players can obtain by completing quests and upgrading their boat.

The first shrine, located near the center of the island, requires the "Double Jump" ability. This ability can be obtained by completing Gwen's quest "A Window to the Past."

The second shrine, located to the east of the island, requires the "Glide" ability. This ability can be obtained by completing Summer's quest "The Silver Company."

The third and final shrine, located to the southeast of the island, requires the "Zipline" ability. This ability can be obtained by completing Atul's quest "Tool Upgrade: Zipline."

Step 3: Meditate at Each Shrine

Once all three shrines are unlocked, players must meditate at each one to unlock the ultimate meditation ability. To meditate, players need to stand in the center of the shrine and press the meditate button.

Step 4: Get the Ultimate Meditation Ability

After meditating at all three shrines, players will unlock the ultimate meditation ability. To use it, players need to press the meditation button and select a location on the map. They will instantly teleport to that location, saving them travel time and effort.

Unlocking the ultimate meditation ability in Spiritfarer requires players to complete quests and upgrade their boat. But once it is unlocked, it can improve the gameplay experience and make it easier to explore the mystical world of Spiritfarer. So, head over to the Island of Meditation and unlock this powerful ability today!

Spiritfarer is a cozy and relaxing game that has an emotional aspect to it. So it only makes sense to have an activity that is inherently relaxing and thatâ€™s meditation. Yes, you can meditate in Spiritfarer but you have to unlock it before you can use it. If you are curious to know how to unlock meditation ability, here are all the steps you have to follow.
 
## Spiritfarer: How to Meditate Easily
 
The first thing you need to do to unlock the meditation ability is to find a snake that is named Summer. She wears a hooded green coat adorned by a flower belt. Now, you have to continue her questline by fulfilling her requests. Soon, you will get a task where Summer requests you to find a meditation area. Once you do that, she will tell you how to meditate. That is basically how you will get this ability.
 
Now, how to find the perfect meditation spot for Summer? Well, it has to be a calm and serene location. Make sure to visit the place where she wants to find a spot, and then move ahead until you get one Summer is happy with. Next, she will teach you how to meditate and to do that you need to go ahead and press the following buttons based on your platform:
 
- Square on PS4
 - X on Xbox One
 - Y on Switch

 
You can do this activity in soothing places like those surrounded with trees or a rock. When you come across such locations, you will be able to meditate easily.
 
### When should you meditate in Spiritfarer?
 
Wondering how to use meditation in this game? Well, apart from being an activity that helps your character chill, you can easily and quickly pass time with it. This will come in handy when you need a different time to complete a certain objective or to make time pass faster. For some specific quests, meditation can help you pass time from day to night or vice versa. Moreover, you can build a meditation room for Summer on your boat using the Blueprint table. Of course, you will need the necessary materials for it.
 
Spiritfarer is all about finding peace before your spirits move into the afterlife through the Everdoor, so the existence of this ability really gives the game more depth. Even though it is not a mechanic that makes a huge difference in the game, it still adds good detail to it.
