Halo Infinite is one of the most highly-anticipated games of recent times. With a popular franchise that Xbox Game Studios is backing, there’s a lot to expect from it. Due to the huge popularity, it’s natural that a huge number of players will flock to it to try it out. So, if you get some connection/login issues and multiplayer is not loading, chances are that the Halo Infinite servers are down. Here’s how to check the server status.
 
## Is Halo Infinite Down? How to Check Server Status
 

 
Here’s how to check the Halo Infinite server status if you’re not able to play multiplayer.
 
- Check the official @Halo Twitter account.
 - Check if any issues that you’re having are addressed on the official Halo Support website.
 - Head to third party sites such as Downdetector to know more
 - Find out if Steam or Xbox Live are down.
 - Get more info from the Social Media community.

 
### Get Updates from the Official Twitter Account
 
Head over the official @Halo Twitter for any latest information about outage, downtime or maintenance period. Since the game is quite popular, the devs may increase the server capacity whenever required, for which they will need to close the servers for players for some time.
 
### Check issues mentioned on the Halo Support website
 
Any known issues such as problems with the Halo Infinite multiplayer will be addressed and posted on the official support website. This is where you can find out if the devs are aware of a certain problem and further investigating it.
 
### Check Third-Party Sites such as Downdetector
 
Downdetector provides a graph through which you can find out the timing when the issues and problems began and when they have reduced and been fixed. It’s quite a dependable site in this matter, so do check this out as well.
 
### Check if Steam or Xbox Live are down
 
Sometimes it’s the platform that’s having an outage that should ideally be fixed soon. But you can find out more by heading over to the Steam status and Xbox live status pages.
 
### Social Media Community
 
Simply search the name of the game or its hashtag via Twitter Search and see if other players are also facing the same problems. If not, make sure to check if it’s your internet connection which is causing the connection problems or lag.
 
That’s basically everything you need to do to find out the Halo Infinite server status and know if servers are down or not. When will the servers be back up? It’s never confirmed – it may take an hour or it may even take a day. All we can do at that point is wait it out.
