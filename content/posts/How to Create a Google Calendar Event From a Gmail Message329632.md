- Open the message in Gmail and click the three-dot icon on the toolbar. Alternatively, you can press the period key if you have Gmail keyboard shortcuts enabled.
 - Select Create event to open a Google Calendar screen. Google Calendar populates the event's name with the subject line of the email and the description area with the email's body contents. Make any needed changes to these two areas.
 - Select a date, start time, and end time from the drop-down menus under the event name at the top of the screen if they don't transfer from the email. If the event is an all-day event or repeats at regular intervals, make the necessary choices in the date area.
 - Add a location for the event.
 - Set a notification to remind you about the event at the specified time.
 - Assign a color to indicate whether you are Busy or Free during the event.
 - Press Save to save the event to your calendar. If you need to make any changes later, select the event in the calendar and then click the Pencil icon to edit the event.

 
##   Add Gmail Events Automatically to Google Calendar Using a Mobile App
