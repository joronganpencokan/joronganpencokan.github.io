# Is Your Snapchat Crush Ghosting You? Here's the Sneaky Way to Know if They've Blocked You!

In this day and age, social media and messaging apps like Snapchat have become a crucial part of our daily lives, especially when it comes to dating and relationships. If you are someone who uses Snapchat to communicate with your crush or potential love interest, you might have experienced one of the most frustrating dating phenomena ever: ghosting.

Ghosting is a term used when someone suddenly stops talking to you, without any explanation or warning. While getting ghosted can be a frustrating experience, it's not always clear why it's happening. It's possible that the person is simply busy or dealing with something else, but it's also possible that they've blocked you.

If you suspect your Snapchat crush is ghosting you, it can be tempting to assume the worst and move on. However, before you draw any conclusions, there's a sneaky way to check if they've actually blocked you. Here's what you need to know:

### Step 1: Check your Snap Map

Snap Map is a feature in Snapchat that allows you to see the location of your friends and acquaintances. If your crush has enabled Snap Map and is sharing their location with you, you should be able to see their Bitmoji avatar on the map. If you cannot see their avatar, it may indicate that they have blocked you.

Keep in mind that if your crush has disabled Snap Map or isn't sharing their location with you, this method won't be useful.

### Step 2: Check your Snapchat Stories

If your crush has blocked you, you won't be able to see their Snapchat Stories. To check if they've blocked you, go to their profile and see if there are no Snapchat Stories available. If that's the case, it may be a sign that they've blocked you.

### Step 3: Send a Snap

If you're still unsure whether your crush has blocked you, you can try sending them a Snap. If the Snap doesn't send and you get an error message, it may indicate that they've blocked you. However, keep in mind that this is not a foolproof method, as there are other reasons why Snapchats don't send, such as connectivity issues or the other person's settings.

### Conclusion

If you're experiencing ghosting from your Snapchat crush, it's important to remember that it's not always personal. Before you jump to any conclusions, it's helpful to understand why they might be ignoring you. If you suspect they've blocked you, follow these easy steps to check. And, remember, if someone is ghosting you or has blocked you, it's likely that they aren't worth your time and effort anyway. Move on and find someone who's willing to treat you with the respect you deserve.

If you suspect you've been blocked on Snapchat, you'll have to do the following investigative work to confirm it.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- If you recently chatted, they should appear in your conversations. If not, you're probably blocked.You wonâ€™t find any trace of the person who blocked you on Snapchat when you search for their username or full name.Search for the user from a different account, on a different device. If they appear in the search, you've been blocked.

 
##   Ways to Find Out if You're Blocked on Snapchat  
 

Here are the main actions you should take to determine if someone has blocked you on Snapchat.

 
- Check your recent conversations. The first big clue that can tell you whether a user has blocked you is by looking at whether they show up in your chat history. This step is only useful if you've chatted with the user who might have blocked you before clearing your Snapchat conversations.
 - Open the Snapchat app and navigate to the conversations tab by tapping the speech bubble icon at the bottom of the screen to the left of the camera snap button. If the user who you suspect blocked you isn't appearing in your Chat list despite having a recent conversation with them, that's a big clue. However, you still need to move on to the next step to confirm the block.
 - Alternatively, you might not have had a recent conversation with the user in question or forgot that you cleared your history. If this is the case, move on to the next step.
 - Search their username or full name. If a user has blocked you, they won't show up when you search for them within Snapchat. If they've deleted you from their Friends list, however, you should be able to find them by searching for them.
 - It's vital to understand the difference between being blocked and being deleted on Snapchat. If a user blocked you, you wouldn't find any trace of their account, and you will be unable to contact them in any way from your blocked account.
 - If a user deleted you from their Friends list, you'd still find them in your Friends list, and you'll be able to continue sending them snaps. Depending on their Snapchat privacy settings, however, they may not receive them if they only allow their friends to contact them.
 - To search for the user who you suspect blocked you, tap the Search function at the top of the screen on the conversations tab or snap tab, marked by a magnifying glass icon. Start typing the username or full name of the user you want to look up.
 - You'll get more accurate results if you know the user's username. There could be several other users with similar full names, but usernames are all unique. Likewise, full names can be changed anytime, whereas usernames are permanent.
 - If the user shows up in search results, they'll appear under the My Friends label in you're still in their Friends list or under the Add Friends label if they deleted you from their Friends list.
 - If the user you're looking for doesn't show up at all despite searching for their exact username, then they either blocked you or deleted their Snapchat account.
 - Search their username or full name from a different account. Being unable to find the user you searched for in the last step increases the likelihood that they blocked you; however, this is still not enough to confirm it. You can potentially confirm that their account still exists by searching for the user from another account. You have two options:
 - Ask a friend to search for the user from their account.Sign out of your account and create a brand new account to search for that user.
 - The first option is the easiest because it means you won't have to do all the extra work involved with signing up for a new account. Pick a friend, relative, coworker, or other acquaintance who's on Snapchat and isn't friends with the user you think might have blocked you. Ask them to search for the user by their username (if you know it) or their full name.
 - If you instead decide to create a new account, you'll have to sign out of your existing Snapchat account or download the app to a different mobile device if you have access to one. Tap the Sign Up button to create your account.
 - Snapchat will ask you to provide your full name, birthdate, a username, a password, and phone number (or email address).
 - Now go ahead and either instruct your friend or use your new account to repeat step two above. If you or your friend happen to be successful in finding the user account you were looking for, then that's enough to confirm that they have indeed blocked you.

 

If none of these steps worked, your friend likely deleted their account.
