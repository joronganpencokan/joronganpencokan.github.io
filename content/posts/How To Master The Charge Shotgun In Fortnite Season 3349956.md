# Unleash Your Inner Champion: Learn How To Dominate with the Charge Shotgun in Fortnite Season 3!

If you are a fan of Fortnite, you know that the game is constantly evolving. With every new season come new weapons, items and challenges, making it even more exciting to play. One of the newest weapons in Season 3 is the Charge Shotgun, which has quickly become a fan favorite. In this article, we will teach you how to dominate with the Charge Shotgun, and unleash your inner champion.

## Understanding the Charge Shotgun

Before we get into the specifics of using the Charge Shotgun, it is important to understand its unique features. Unlike other shotguns in the game, the Charge Shotgun requires you to hold down the trigger to charge it up before firing. The longer you hold it down, the more powerful the shot will be. This means that you will need to be patient and time your shots carefully.

Another important aspect of the Charge Shotgun is its range. It has a shorter range than other shotguns, which means that you will need to be closer to your opponents to shoot them. However, if you can get up close and personal, the Charge Shotgun can deal massive amounts of damage.

## Mastering the Charge Shotgun

Now that you understand the basics of the Charge Shotgun, let's get into how to use it effectively. The first thing you need to do is practice timing your shots. This means holding down the trigger just long enough to charge the shotgun, but not too long that your opponent has time to react. The charging time takes a bit to get used to, but with enough practice, you'll be able to time it perfectly every time.

Another important aspect of using the Charge Shotgun is positioning. As mentioned earlier, the Charge Shotgun has a shorter range than other shotguns, so you will need to get up close to your opponents to deal damage. Make sure to use cover to your advantage and get as close as possible before firing.

Once you're in range, aim for your opponent's head for maximum damage. The Charge Shotgun has a tight spread, which means that the pellets will be more concentrated when aimed at the head. This can cause massive damage and give you a significant advantage in the fight.

Lastly, don't be afraid to build. The Charge Shotgun is powerful, but it still requires you to be within range to deal damage. Building cover can help you get closer to your opponent without taking damage, and it can also create openings for you to take shots.

## Conclusion

The Charge Shotgun is quickly becoming a fan favorite in Fortnite Season 3, and for good reason. It requires skill and patience to use effectively, but can deal massive amounts of damage in the right hands. By understanding its unique features and practicing your timing and positioning, you can unleash your inner champion and dominate your opponents with the Charge Shotgun. Happy hunting!
