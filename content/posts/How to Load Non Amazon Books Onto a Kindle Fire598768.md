# Unlock the Hidden Potential of Your Kindle Fire: Learn How to Load Non-Amazon Books with This Easy Trick!

If you're a Kindle Fire user, you probably know how convenient it is to buy and read books from the Amazon store. But did you know that your Kindle Fire can do much more than just that?

With a little bit of tinkering, you can unlock the hidden potential of your device and load non-Amazon books, such as ePub files, PDFs, and even audiobooks. All you need is a computer, a USB cable, and a few simple steps to follow.

Let's get started!

## Step 1: Enable app installations from unknown sources

To load non-Amazon books onto your Kindle Fire, you first need to enable app installations from unknown sources. This allows you to install apps that are not available on the Amazon store, including the apps you need to read ePub and PDF files.

Here's how to do it:

1. Go to your device's Settings.
2. Scroll down and select Security & Privacy.
3. Turn on the toggle switch next to Apps from Unknown Sources.

If you see a warning message, don't worry. This is just a precaution to prevent you from installing potentially harmful apps. Since you're only installing a few trusted apps, there's no need to worry.

## Step 2: Install the required apps

The two apps you need to load non-Amazon books onto your Kindle Fire are:

1. ES File Explorer: This app allows you to navigate and manage the files on your device.

2. Aldiko Book Reader: This app lets you read ePub files, which are not supported by the Kindle app.

To install these apps, follow these steps:

1. Open the Amazon Appstore on your Kindle Fire.
2. Search for "ES File Explorer" and "Aldiko Book Reader".
3. Download and install both apps.

## Step 3: Connect your Kindle Fire to your computer

To transfer non-Amazon books to your Kindle Fire, you need to connect your device to your computer using a USB cable. Once connected, your Kindle Fire will appear as a removable drive on your computer.

## Step 4: Transfer the non-Amazon books to your Kindle Fire

Now that you have everything set up, you're ready to transfer your non-Amazon books to your Kindle Fire. Here's how to do it:

1. On your computer, locate the non-Amazon books you want to transfer to your Kindle Fire.
2. Copy the files to a folder on your computer or directly onto your Kindle Fire. If you copy them onto your Kindle Fire, make sure to place them in a folder where you can easily find them later.
3. Open ES File Explorer on your Kindle Fire.
4. Navigate to the folder where you copied the non-Amazon books.
5. Select the book you want to read and choose "Open With" and then select "Aldiko Book Reader".

And that's it! You can now enjoy reading non-Amazon books on your Kindle Fire.

## Conclusion

By following these simple steps, you can unlock the hidden potential of your Kindle Fire and read non-Amazon books, giving you greater freedom and flexibility with your device.

So next time you come across a great ePub or PDF book that's not available on the Amazon store, don't hesitate to load it onto your Kindle Fire and enjoy reading it at your leisure.
