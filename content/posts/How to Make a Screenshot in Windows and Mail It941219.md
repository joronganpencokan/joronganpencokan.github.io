Step 3: Sending the Screenshot via Email

Now that you have saved the screenshot to your computer, the next step is to send it via email. Open your email account and compose a new message. In the message body, click on the attach file icon, which is usually represented by a paper clip icon. Select the screenshot from the location where you saved it and attach it to the email. Once you have finished writing your message, send the email.
