title: "You Won't Believe Which Weapon Tops Our Halo Infinite Tier List - Prepare to Be Shocked!"

Halo Infinite has been one of the most anticipated games of the year. Fans have been waiting for the next installment of the iconic Halo franchise for a long time, and finally, it's here. With the game's release, players have been diving into the game's multiplayer, and it's safe to say that they are loving it. The game has brought back the classic Halo feel with a modern twist, making it an enjoyable experience for new and old fans alike. But one thing that stands out is the game's vast selection of weapons. Every weapon has its strengths and weaknesses, making it challenging to rank them. However, we've cracked the code and have come up with the ultimate Halo Infinite weapon tier list. 

Without further ado, let's dive into the list. 

Starting at the bottom is the CQS48 Bulldog. This weapon is a shotgun that has been a fan favorite in the past Halo games. However, in Halo Infinite, it's not living up to its legacy. It has a limited range and lacks the power needed to be a dominating force in the game. 

Sitting on the next level is the VK78 Commando. This weapon is an assault rifle that has been added to Halo Infinite. It's a well-balanced weapon, but it's not too exciting. It's a fantastic option if you're out of ammo or need a quick weapon swap. 

Moving up the list, we have the Plasma Pistol. The Plasma Pistol is an iconic weapon that has been in the game since its inception. Many players use it to drain enemy shields, leaving them vulnerable for a quick kill. However, the weapon is a bit slower to use than others, making it a bit of a risk to use in heated environments. 

At the top of the list is the Shock Rifle. This weapon is relatively new to Halo Infinite, but it's already a fan favorite. It's a two-in-one weapon that has a charge-up shot similar to the Plasma Pistol and a secondary shot that launches a beam of energy, similar to the Spartan Laser. It's a versatile weapon that can be used to take on enemies at a distance, making it a top contender. 

In conclusion, Halo Infinite's weapon selection provides players with various options to suit their playstyles. Our top tier weapon, the Shock Rifle, is a great all-around weapon that can be used in many situations. But don't discredit the other weapons, they all have their strengths and weaknesses and can be deadly in the right situation. So, whether you're a fan of the classics or new to the franchise, the game's weapon selection is sure to leave you satisfied. Happy Hunting!

## Best Weapons Tier List in Halo Infinite
 
### S Tier
 

 
As mentioned earlier, the S tier in this Halo Infinite weapons list features the best weapons from the game. Along with significant damage potential, these weapons are also comfortable to use. With them, you will comfortably tackle the trickiest of enemies without breaking a sweat.
 
### A Tier
 
The A tier in this weapons list in Halo Infinite features very good weapons. These weapons will constantly offer you assistance without letting you down, even in the direst of circumstances. While these weapons offer really good damage and ease of use, their shortcomings in a few areas see them drop just a little below the S tier.
 
### B Tier
 
B tier weapons in Halo Infinite boast decent capabilities. While these weapons may not be as powerful or reliable as their higher-tier counterparts, they are still good to use. Even with their noticeable flaws, you will still be able to get decent damage.
 
### C Tier
 
The C tier weapons offer a middle ground between the higher-tier weapons and the lower-tier ones in this list. These weapons are nowhere near the best, yet they manage to offer decent damage when used right. You can call them average at best. These are good weapons if you are planning to use them for a short period of time, before moving on to better weapons.
 
### D Tier
 
The D tier features the least-recommended weapons in Halo Infinite. These weapons are of little assistance in most situations and are as good as useless at times. The weapons here fail to stand out in any way, and we do not recommend you use them.
 
So there you have it. These are all of the weapons in Halo Infinite, ranked from best to worst. With the help of this list, you will be able to make the right decision when it comes to picking guns and other ammo.
