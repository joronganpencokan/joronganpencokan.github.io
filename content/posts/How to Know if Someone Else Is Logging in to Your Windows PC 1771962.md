TITLE: You'll Never Believe How Easy It Is to Find Out if Someone is Stealing Your Windows PC-- #4 Blew Our Minds!

Are you worried about someone stealing your Windows PC? Have you ever experienced the frustration of someone taking your computer without your knowledge? Worry no more because there's a simple and easy solution to this problem.

In this article, we'll share with you the top 4 ways to find out if someone is stealing your Windows PC. The best part? The solutions are so easy that any non-techie can do it.

Before we get started, here are a few signs that may indicate someone has been using your PC:

1. Strange files and programs on your computer which you do not recognise.
2. Unusual activity on your computer such as files being moved or deleted.
3. Programs loading more slowly than usual or not at all.
4. Changes to the homepage of your browser or other settings without your knowledge.

If you observe any of these signs, then it’s time to take action.

1. Check Your Recent Activity

The first thing you should do is check your recent activity. Press the Start button and type "Event Viewer" in the search bar. Click on "Windows Logs" and select "Security."

Here, you'll find a list of all the events that have been recorded on your Windows PC. Look for any suspicious activity that took place while you were not using your computer. This could include logins, shutdowns, or anything else that looks out of place.

2. Use Remote Access Software

Another way to track your stolen Windows PC is using remote access software like LogMeIn, TeamViewer, and AnyDesk. Remote access software allows you to connect to your lost or stolen PC from another location using a different device.

If you think someone else is using your computer without your knowledge, then you can log in remotely and check for any unusual activity. You can also access any files or folders that may have been moved or deleted.

3. Protect Your PC With Alarms

The next step is to make sure that your computer is protected by an alarm system. There are several such systems available that can alert you whenever someone tries to use your computer without your permission. These include theft-resistant cable locks, motion detectors, and security cameras.

An alarm system will not necessarily stop someone from stealing your computer. But it can help you identify who is using it.

4. Track Your Laptop's Location

Finally, you can track your stolen Windows PC by using a tracking device. Some Windows PCs come with tracking software already installed, such as Find My Device, which allows you to track your stolen laptop's location. All you need to do is enable the tracking feature and create a Microsoft account.

Once your computer is stolen, you can sign in to your Microsoft account online and locate your computer's last-known location. This information can help the police track down your stolen PC more easily.

In conclusion, if you're concerned about someone stealing your Windows PC, then there's an easy solution. By following the simple steps outlined above, you can easily find out if someone is using your computer without your knowledge. The best part? These solutions are easy to implement and require no technical expertise whatsoever.

Do you think someone has been logging in to your Windows PC while you have been away? If your bloodhound failed to track down the culprit, then we have some handy ways for you to find out whether your PC was accessed. They may not have left a physical clue, but there is a good chance they left evidence in Windows somewhere. Uncover whether someone else is logging in to your Windows PC using any combination of the following methods.
 
## Recent Activity in Jump Lists
 
Current versions of Windows 10 no longer show recent activity, outside of recently added apps, in the Start menu. Skip to the next section if you’re using an an earlier version of Windows 10 or earlier versions of Windows.
 
However, Windows 11 does show recommendations in the Start menu. (The feature is turned on by default, but sneaky users might have turned it off.) These are based off of recent usage, which can indicate if someone else was using your PC.
 
However, you can view recently accessed files by right-clicking apps in your Start menu and taskbar. Want to see if someone opened a Word doc? Open any Word doc, right-click its icon on the taskbar (this also works if you have a pinned shortcut on the taskbar), and look for Recent.
 
You can do the same thing in your Start menu. Right-click any app you think someone might have accessed to look for any recent items, including browser items. If your browser auto-deletes history on close, nothing may show.
 
Alternately, open File Explorer and look under “Quick Access.”
 
You may need to turn this setting on if it’s not on by default. Go to “Start -> Settings -> Personalization -> Start.”
 
Ensure “Show recently opened items in Start, Jump Lists, and File Explorer” is turned on.
 
## Recent Activity (Older Versions of Windows and Windows 10)
 
Let’s start with the basics. If someone has accessed your account, then they must have used it for something. You need to look for changes to your PC that weren’t done by you.
 
The starting point will be the recent programs that appear in the Start menu. Click on the Start menu to see the most recent programs that were open. You will only see a change if the intruder has accessed a program that you didn’t use recently.  
 
One of the drawbacks is that they could always delete the item from here if they are smart enough. Furthermore, if the recent item view was enabled on your PC, hover your mouse cursor over the “Recent Items” button on the right side of the Start Menu to see all the files that were opened recently. The file entry will stay there even if the actual files are deleted.
 
Other common places to look for changes include your browser history, recent documents and the “Programs” option in the control panel for recently added programs.
 
This isn’t available in Windows 11. Recent items are only listed by right-clicking an app icon and in Quick Access. However, if the recent items feature is turned off in your PC settings, they won’t appear here either.
 
## Check Windows Event Viewer
 
The above step was just to alert you that something is wrong. Let’s get serious and dig up some solid proof if you suspect someone else is logging in to your Windows PC. Windows keeps a complete record of when an account is logged in successfully and failed attempts at logging in. You can view this from the Windows Event Viewer.
 
To access the Windows Event Viewer, press Win + R and type eventvwr.msc in the “Run” dialog  box. When you press Enter, the Event Viewer will open.
 
In the left pane, expand “Windows Logs” and select “Security.”
 
In the middle panel, you’ll see multiple logon entries with date and time stamps. Every time you log in, Windows records multiple logon entries within a total time period of two to four minutes. Focus on the time these entries were made, and look for any times that you weren’t actively logged in. 
 
If there is an entry, it means someone did access your PC. Windows won’t make fake entries, so you can trust this data.  Additionally, you can also check which particular account was accessed during that period (if you have multiple accounts). To check, double-click on a “Special Logon” entry during that period, and “Event properties” will open. Here you will see the name of the account next to “Account Name.”
 
Event viewer is also a great way to check out PC startup and shutdown history. This can also serve as a clue that someone might have turned on and used your PC while you were away.
 
## Show Last Login Details at Startup
 
The above method is quite solid for catching the intruder, but if they were smart enough, they could have cleared all the event logs. In that case, you can set up last login details to show up as soon as the PC starts. This will show you when the account was last logged in and any failed attempts. This information cannot be deleted and can only help you for future unauthorized access as you will be setting it up next.
 
You will be editing the Windows Registry, so make sure you create a backup of it. Press Win + R and enter regedit in the Run dialog box to open the Windows Registry. In the Registry, click on “File -> Export,” pick a location for the backup file in the file chooser, then click the “Save” button.
 
To check previous login information In the Registry:
 
- Move to the below-mentioned location:

 
- Right-click on the “System” folder and select “DWORD value” from the “New” option.

 
- An entry will be created ready to be renamed; you need to name it “DisplayLastLogonInfo.”

 
- Double-click on this entry and set its value to “1.”

 
Now whenever you (or someone else) logs in to your PC, you will first see when you last logged in and any failed attempts.
 
## Check Browser History
 
If your browser automatically deletes history when you close it, this won’t help. But even if it doesn’t, many people forget to delete their history when they’re using someone’s PC without permission. Simply open your browser(s) and access the history using the Settings menu for your specific browser.
 
## Catch Remote Users
 
It’s unnerving to have someone logging in to your PC in person, but what about remotely? The methods above still work well to let you know whether a remote user has been on your PC. Typically, your Windows login history in Event Viewer will show even remote login events. A few other things to check for remote Windows logins include:
 
- Check your PC for any new apps. If you see something you didn’t install or that was installed recently without your permission, research it to see what it does. It’s possible it’s a result of malware and that the new app is allowing remote users to log in.Check your firewall. If you have a firewall installed, remote connections may show up. You may even notice a current active connection. Use your firewall to block remote users. The steps and settings vary greatly based on the type of firewall, and Windows has a built-in firewall. Go to “Settings -> Privacy & security -> Windows Security,” then go to “Open Security” and select “Firewall & network protection.” Select “Advanced Settings” to view events associated with the firewall.

 
- Scan for viruses. If someone’s logging in to Windows remotely without your permission, it may be due to malware. Run a virus scan regularly to check for malicious apps. If you don’t have anything installed, consider using Windows Defender.Check that your antivirus and firewall haven’t been disabled. If these have been disabled, it’s a sign of malware and possible remote access.

 
The above methods should be able to alert you about unauthorized access. However, they will not tell you “who” actually accessed your account. So yes, you’ll need to do a little more investigative work outside of your PC. 
 
Remember, if someone uses your account and is smart enough to clear their traces, it’s tricky to catch them. Always log out of your account if you leave your PC to prevent someone from using it.
 
## Frequently Asked Questions
 
### 1. How can I find out who is using my PC?
 
While your Windows login history lets you know something’s amiss, it doesn’t tell you who is responsible. If there are multiple potential culprits, consider hiding a camera or even having your webcam turn on and record upon logon. This won’t work for remote logons, but it helps catch people in your home or office. You may need permission to do this at your workplace.
 
So far, we’ve only talked about technical ways to check for unauthorized access. You can also use physical methods to check for access. For example, you might place a hair or thin string on your keyboard or mouse to see if they’ve been used. You could use a light powder on your mouse. If it’s gone or faded, you know someone’s been using it. Get creative with your traps.
 
### 2. How can I prevent unauthorized access to my PC?
 
If you’ve discovered unauthorized Windows logins, there are several ways to prevent access in the future, such as:
 
- Set up a login for your PC. You might have Windows set to log in automatically without a password. If someone’s using your PC without your permission, switch back to using a password, PIN, or even biometric login (if available on your device). Always log out of your PC when you’re not using it. If someone logs on, change your password immediately.Add separate accounts for each user, including kids. If you have a shared PC, ensure every user has their own account. This helps protect your files and settings. However, be aware that kids may still get around parental controls to access things they’re not supposed to.Never allow remote access unless it’s a reputable app or user you fully trust. Use a VPN any time you use public Wi-Fi. If hackers gain access to your PC while you’re in public, they can install apps that allow them to remotely log back in later.
