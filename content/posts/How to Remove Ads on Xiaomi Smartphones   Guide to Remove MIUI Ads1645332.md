# Say Goodbye To Xiaomi Ad Overload In Just A Few Clicks - Your Ultimate Guide To Removing Miui Ads!

If you have ever used a Xiaomi device, you must have encountered Miui ads. These ads can be frustrating and annoying, especially when you are in the middle of doing something important. Fortunately, there’s a way to get rid of these ads. In this ultimate guide, we will show you how to remove Miui ads in just a few clicks!

## Step 1: Check Your Miui Version

Before we proceed, it’s vital to check your Miui version. The process of removing ads varies depending on the Miui version. To check the Miui version on your device, go to “Settings,” then “About Phone,” and finally, “Miui Version.” Make a note of the version and proceed to step two.

## Step 2: Disable Personalized Ads

Now that you know your Miui version, the next step is to disable personalized ads. This feature allows Xiaomi to show you ads based on your browsing history and app usage. Disabling this feature will significantly reduce the number of ads you see on your device. To disable personalized ads, follow these steps:

- Go to “Settings”
- Scroll down and select “Privacy”
- Tap on “Ad services”
- Toggle off “Personalized ad recommendations”
- Tap on “Ad preferences”
- Toggle off “Receive recommendations”

## Step 3: Disable MSA

MSA (Miui System Ads) is a background service that runs on Xiaomi devices. It enables the company to display ads on the lock screen, settings, and other system apps. To disable MSA, follow these steps:

- Go to “Settings”
- Scroll down and select “Additional settings”
- Tap on “Authorization & revocation”
- Disable “msa”

## Step 4: Remove System Apps That Display Ads

Some Xiaomi system apps display ads, and the only way to get rid of them is to remove them from your device. However, this step requires a bit of caution as removing the wrong system app can cause your device to malfunction. If you’re not sure which system apps to remove, it’s best to skip this step. Otherwise, follow these steps:

- Go to “Settings”
- Tap on “Apps”
- Scroll down and select the system app you want to remove
- Tap on “Uninstall”

## Conclusion

Removing Miui ads is not a complicated process. With just a few clicks, you can significantly reduce the number of ads you see on your Xiaomi device. By disabling personalized ads, MSA, and removing system apps that display ads, you can enjoy a more seamless and productive experience on your device.

But Ads can get annoying at times, especially if you have them overlaying on top of core apps or services that you use frequently. If you own a Xiaomi phone, chances are you’ve encountered a ton of ads spread across the UI or system apps (unless you have the Mi A1 or A2 which are Android One devices and do away with MIUI in favor of stock android) which surely hinders your user experience.

 
## How to Stop Ads in Xiaomi Redmi smartphones?


Thankfully, there are numerous ways to fix, or rather, break Xiaomi’s ad service so as to have a pleasant experience while using your phone. So, let’s get to what you should do. Also, we suggest you to follow this guide in its entirety to get rid of ads across all your system apps. Do note that these steps can be followed for MIUI 9.6+ as well as MIUI 10.

 
### Disable Ad Authorization


This is the first step for freeing yourself from ads that you see in stock MIUI apps.
Head over to the ‘Settings’ app on your phone and navigate to ‘Additional Settings’ and then select ‘Authorization and Revocation’ and disable ‘msa’. Now, this option might not get disabled the first time you try, so if it throws an error, just try disabling it again, and it should happen this time.

By disabling the authorization to display ads, apps like Browser, Security, Downloads, etc. will not have the permission to display ads anymore. Also, it prevents the algorithm which displays ads from being revoked so that you won’t see the ad recur on your phone. This step alone might work for some, but some of our readers have reported that it doesn’t work completely and they continue to see ads at some places. If this doesn’t work, proceed to the next step below.
Note – Xiaomi doesn’t let you turn off the ‘msa’ option from MIUI 10 8.9.20 onwards, so the workaround is to head over to Settings > Apps > msa > Restrict data usage.

 
### Manually Disabling Ad Services from MIUI System Apps


The ads that you receive on a daily basis in MIUI are usually pushed from apps like File Manager, Music, Downloads, Browser, etc. This can easily be tackled by digging for options under menus and disabling ‘Recommendations’. We’ll tell you how it’s done.

 

Let’s do this one app at a time. First, head over to the Mi File Manager and tap on the 3 lines that appear at the top left corner to open up the hamburger menu. The head over to Settings > About and disable the ‘Recommendations’ tab.





 

Next comes the Security app, which probably operates contrary to its moniker by showing you ads based on your usage patterns. To prevent this, fire up the Security app, then go to settings by tapping the gear icon on the top right and disable ‘Receive Recommendations’. While you’re at it, also head over to the ‘Cleaner’ section in the same settings menu and disable the ‘Receive Recommendations’ option here as well.





 

The default MIUI browser is what displays maximum ads since it has permissions to be connected to the internet all the time, so let’s handle that. Also, this setting is really buried in a place you wouldn’t expect to find it, so probably Xiaomi doesn’t want you to disable it after all! Once you open up the Browser app, got to Settings > Advanced > Top sites order and disable ‘Receive recommendations’.





 

Another app linked to the internet is Downloads, so once in the app, head over to Settings and deselect ‘Show recommended content’.





 

Since MIUI 9, the default Music app is integrated with online services, which again means a ton of ads. To disable this, open up the Music app, go to Settings > Advanced Settings and turn off ‘Recommendations’.





 
### Disable Advertising Tracker


Lastly, let’s disable the service which tracks your usage patterns to display user specific ads. Open the Settings app and navigate to Additional Settings > Privacy > Ad Services and disable ‘Personalized Ad Recommendation’

Once you follow all these steps, reboot your device for the settings to take effect.
Alternatively, you could also use a service named Blokada which blocks ads system-wide giving you a complete ad-free experience if that’s what you’re looking for. Mind you, this is a third party service, so understand the risks involved before you proceed. We don’t really suggest you this over the others mentioned above.
If you followed these steps accurately, you could be assured that you will not see ads anymore on your home screen or as banners on stock apps or in the form of notifications.
