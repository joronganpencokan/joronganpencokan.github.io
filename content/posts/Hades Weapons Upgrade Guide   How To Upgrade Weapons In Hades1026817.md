# You won't believe how easy it is to upgrade your weapons in Hades! Master the game with our ultimate guide!

If you're a fan of action-packed, fast-paced games, you'll undoubtedly have heard of Hades. The game's popularity has exploded since its release in 2020, and it's easy to see why. This rogue-like dungeon crawler has it all: stunning visuals, a gripping storyline, and challenging gameplay.

One of the standout features of Hades is the vast array of weapons available to players. From blades to bows, players can choose their preferred weapon, upgrade it, and unleash its power in the underworld.

In this article, we'll give you a step-by-step guide to upgrading your weapons in Hades, so you can dominate the game.

## Choose Your Weapon

The first step to upgrading your weapon is choosing the right one. In Hades, players can select from six primary weapons:

* Stygian Blade
* Heart-Seeking Bow
* Shield of Chaos
* Twin Fists of Malphon
* Adamant Rail
* Exagryph

Each weapon has unique abilities, ranging from dash strikes to area-of-effect attacks. Take some time to experiment with each weapon and choose the one that feels most natural to you.

## Unlock Weapon Aspects

Once you've chosen your weapon, you'll want to unlock its aspects. Aspects are abilities that can be upgraded using Titan Blood, a rare resource that can be found by defeating bosses.

To unlock new aspects, players must defeat bosses with their chosen weapon, with each boss unlocking a new aspect. Aspects can be switched out as players acquire more Titan Blood, so don't be afraid to experiment with different combinations.

## Upgrade Your Weapon

Once you've unlocked your weapon's aspects, it's time to upgrade its base statistics. To do this, players must use darkness, a resource earned by completing runs in the underworld.

Players can access the weapon upgrade menu by talking to the Weapons Master in the House of Hades. Here, they can choose between using darkness to upgrade their weapon's base stats, or using keys to unlock new abilities.

It's essential to upgrade your weapon regularly as you progress through the game's challenging levels. Increasing your weapon's base stats will improve its damage output, making it easier to defeat tougher enemies.

## Use Boons to Strengthen Your Weapon

Finally, players can use boons to augment their weapon's abilities further. Boons are upgrades that can be obtained by sacrificing nectar or ambrosia, resources earned by interacting with characters in the House of Hades.

Each boon has unique effects, from increasing damage output to granting additional attacks. Be sure to experiment with different boons to find the ones that synergize best with your weapon of choice.

In conclusion, upgrading your weapons in Hades is a straightforward process, and players can do so with a combination of Titan Blood, darkness, and boons. By leveling up your weapons, unlocking its aspects, and using boons, you'll be able to take on even the toughest challenges thrown your way. So, what are you waiting for? Step into the underworld and become a master of Hades today!
