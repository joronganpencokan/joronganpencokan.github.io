Are you ready to unleash your inner Spartan in Halo Infinite campaign? Mastering the art of switching equipment is crucial in order to triumph over enemies and complete missions successfully.

In this article, we will provide you with tips and tricks to help you switch equipment seamlessly, giving you an advantage on the battlefield.

Firstly, it is important to familiarize yourself with the equipment available in Halo Infinite. As a Spartan, you are equipped with a wide range of weapons and gadgets that can be used to demolish your foes.

To switch equipment, simply press the “Y” button on Xbox or “Triangle” button on PlayStation to swap weapons, while pressing and holding the “X” button on Xbox and “Square” on PlayStation to swap gadgets.

It is important to know which weapons and gadgets to use in certain situations. For example, when facing groups of enemies, it is best to use grenades or explosive weapons to take out multiple enemies at once.

When encountering a heavily-armoured enemy, it is best to switch to a weapon with armour-piercing capabilities such as the Sniper Rifle, or use a gadget like the Plasma Pistol to disable their shields.

Another tip to master switching equipment is to assign favourite gadgets and weapons to the directional pad or other quick-select buttons. This allows for faster swapping during intense gameplay, as you will not have to scroll through your entire arsenal to find the desired weapon or gadget.

Additionally, it is important to always be on the lookout for new equipment to add to your collection. Some of the best weapons and gadgets in the game are often hidden in secret areas or rewarded after completing certain missions.

By mastering the art of switching equipment, you will be able to level up your gameplay and crush your opponents with ease. So, unleash your inner Spartan and take on the enemy with the confidence that comes from being a master of your equipment.

In conclusion, mastering the art of switching equipment in Halo Infinite campaign will greatly increase your chances of success. By being familiar with your arsenal, assigning hotkeys, and using the right weapon or gadget for the situation, you will be well on your way to triumphing over your enemies.

Halo Infinite Campaign is an amazing game with stunning graphics, smooth mechanics, and an incredible story. In Halo Infinite Campaign, Players have Abilities that they can use alongside their Guns. There are 5 Abilities that the Players can use, one of which is a passive Ability. Abilities are also known as Equipment. During the game, the player can switch between equipment giving him/her an advantage in Battle. The management of your Abilities is what sets apart great Players from average Players. In today’s guide, I will show you how to switch between Equipment in Halo Infinite Campaign.
 
## How to Switch Equipment in Halo Infinite Campaign
 

 
To keep it simple, Equipment are Abilities that the Player can use at any time in Battle as long as they are not on a Cooldown. There are 5 Equipments at your disposal, they are Grappleshot, Thrusters, Shield Core, Drop Shield, and Threat Sensor. Each of these is unique and is useful in any situation you may be in. To switch between this Equipment is pretty easy in Halo Infinite, here is how to do it.
 
- On Console:
 - Press Right on the D-Pad to open up the Equipments Tab and then press any one of the arrows on the D-Pad to use an Equipment. To use it press RB.
 - On PC:
 - Press the corresponding Hotkey on the Number Keys (1,2,3, & 4) above the Letter Keys. To use it Press Q.

 
### Why switch between Equipments?
 
This is how you can Switch between Equipment in Halo Infinite Campaign. Switching between Equipment is important as one of those Abilities is going to help you out in a Sticky Situation. Want to pick up an item or kite an enemy? Grappleshot is your best option. Want to dampen the enemy’s incoming bullets? Drop Shield is going to be your go-to. Want to be beefy? Shield Core is your Equipment. Although, Shield Core is passive Equipment so it is always equipped. Want to reach higher-up places and dodge enemies? Thrusters are the best for it. Want to detect items, enemies, and invisible enemies around you? Threat Sensor is the right Equipment.
 
- Press Right on the D-Pad to open up the Equipments Tab and then press any one of the arrows on the D-Pad to use an Equipment. To use it press RB.

 
- Press the corresponding Hotkey on the Number Keys (1,2,3, & 4) above the Letter Keys. To use it Press Q.

 
As we have seen, Equipments cover a wide range of situations and learning how to use them is important. I would advise you to first learn how to switch between 2 Equipments, like Grappleshot and Drop Shield. Keeping these on Muscle Memory will benefit any Player immensely. After this part, you can focus on learning the others as it will become second nature.
