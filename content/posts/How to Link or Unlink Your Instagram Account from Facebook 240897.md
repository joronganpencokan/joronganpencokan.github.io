In today's world, social media is an essential tool for businesses and individuals alike. However, managing multiple social media accounts can be time-consuming and challenging. Fortunately, Instagram and Facebook have a solution to simplify the process: linking the two platforms. In this article, we will discuss the benefits of linking Instagram and Facebook and provide a step-by-step guide on how to do it.

## Why Link Instagram and Facebook?

Linking Instagram and Facebook accounts can have many benefits. Here are a few:

### Cross-Promote Content

Connecting your Instagram and Facebook accounts allows you to share your Instagram posts on your Facebook page. This cross-promotion can help increase your reach and engagement on both platforms. When you post on Instagram, your post can appear on your Facebook page, allowing followers from both accounts to engage with your content.

### Save Time

Connecting your accounts also reduces the time-consuming need for posting the same content on both platforms. With a simple click, your Instagram post can be automatically reposted on your Facebook page, saving you time and effort.

### Business Advantages

If you're a business owner, linking Instagram and Facebook accounts comes with some unique perks. Firstly, it enables you to use the Instagram account as a business account which allows you to gain insights into your audience and post metrics, providing you with valuable data for business decision making.

Secondly, it helps to streamline the management of your social media strategy by consolidating your online presence in one place. This integration can further ensure that you are giving consistent messaging across both platforms.

## How to Link Instagram to Facebook

Now that we understand why linking Instagram and Facebook is essential, let's go over the steps you can follow to connect your accounts:

### Step 1 – Open Instagram App

Launch the Instagram app from your phone's home screen. Ensure that you have already logged into your Instagram account.

### Step 2 – Go to Settings

From the Instagram profile page, tap on three horizontal lines at the top right corner of the screen. This icon will display the settings for the app.

### Step 3 – Connect Accounts

Under the stored account section, navigate to and click on "Linked Accounts." The option will show which social media apps can be linked to Instagram. Here, find and click on Facebook and enter your login credentials; after successfully logging in, Click OK.

### Step 4 – Adjust Settings

Once your accounts have been linked, you should see more settings options. Here, you can choose to share your Instagram content on your Facebook page by toggling on the "Share to Facebook" option.

### Step 5 – Enable Automatic Posting

Finally, if you want your photos to automatically post to Facebook, you can activate the "Automatic" toggle for Facebook. This option will automatically replicate all new Instagram posts on your Facebook account.

## Conclusion

Linking Instagram to Facebook is an excellent way to streamline and coordinate your social media activity. It saves time, extends your reach, and provides valuable data for businesses. By following the five simple steps in this guide, connecting your accounts will be quick and easy. So go ahead and take advantage of these benefits today!

If you are a regular user of both Instagram and Facebook, it may be helpful to link your two accounts so that you can share content across both platforms. But you may not want the two to be connected. This guide shows you how to link your accounts and how to unlink Instagram from Facebook if you desire.
 
## Why Link Your Instagram to Facebook?
 
You can continue to use Instagram and Facebook independently. However, if you’re on both platforms, it’s easier to have the two linked together. By doing so, you’ll be saving yourself the extra time you’d otherwise spend on posting the same content in two places.
 
Once linked, Instagram lets you share posts automatically to Facebook or manually select the posts you want to share to Facebook from the new post page. In addition, you can choose to send posts, stories, or both to Facebook and share Instagram stories as Facebook stories as well.
 
## How to Link Your Instagram Account to Your Facebook Profile
 
You can only link your Instagram account to Facebook from the Instagram mobile app or the web application and not the other way around. It used to be possible in the past, but that’s no longer the case.
 
### Link Instagram to Facebook on Desktop
 
On the desktop, you can easily link your Instagram to your Facebook by accessing the Accounts Center. Follow the instructions below.
 
1. Open Instagram on your PC.
 
2. Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner.
 
3. Select Settings.
 
4. Scroll down and click on “Accounts Center” on the left.
 
5. On the “Accounts Center” page, tap on “Add accounts.”
 
6. If you’re already logged in to Facebook on your desktop, you’ll be asked whether you want to continue with that particular account. 
 
Alternatively, log in with the Facebook account you want to link to your Instagram.
 
7. Click on Continue.
 
8. Select “Yes, finish setup.”
 
That’s it. You’ve connected the two accounts.
 
### How to Link Instagram to Facebook on Mobile
 
On mobile, the process is quite similar. For the purpose of this tutorial, we are using an Android device, but the steps on iOS are the same.
 
1. In the Instagram app, tap on your profile picture in the bottom right of your profile.
 
2. Tap on the hamburger menu in the top right.
 
3. Select Settings from the menu that pops up.
 
4. Tap on “Accounts Center” at the bottom.
 
5. Select “Set up Accounts Center.”
 
6. Choose the Facebook account you want to connect. If you’ve already logged in on this device with your Facebook account, tap “Continue.” 
 
Alternatively, tap on the “Not you” button if you wish to log in with another account or when using a borrowed device. You will be redirected to a Facebook login page.
 
7. Confirm your choice by tapping “Yes, finish setup.”
 
8. Agree to sync your profile picture if you want to, then tap Continue. Select “Not Now” if you want your name and profile picture synced.
 
Now that you’ve linked the two accounts, you can share an Instagram post to Facebook from the same page where you add a caption. You can also opt to have your stories and posts shared automatically between apps. 
 
Tap on the “Story & Post Sharing” in Accounts Center on your Instagram account, then toggle on the option to automatically share stories and posts on Facebook. Alternatively, you can opt to automatically share Facebook stories on Instagram.
 
## How to Link Your Instagram DMs to Facebook Messenger
 
Once you’ve linked your two accounts, you can upgrade your direct messaging experience by connecting your Instagram DMs to Facebook Messenger.
 
Note: you can only do this through your mobile Instagram app.
 
1. In the Instagram app, tap on the DM paper airplane icon in the upper-right corner.
 
2. You will be greeted with a new screen that invites you to upgrade to Messenger. Tap on the “Update” button.
 
This action will overhaul your overall DM experience to look more like Messenger. You’ll find all the familiar features, too, including the abilities to reply to individual messages; forward messages; customize chat colors; and add selfie stickers, custom emoji reactions and more.
 
If don’t see this option in your DMs, then try hitting Settings to see if you can spot an “Update Messaging” offer in there.
 
## How to Disconnect Instagram DMs from Facebook Messenger
 
Want to go back to the old DMs in Instagram? You can do that, while still keeping your Instagram and Facebook accounts connected.
 
1. In your Instagram app, go to Settings.
 
2. Select Privacy.
 
3. Go to Messages.
 
4. Under “Message Controls,” find the “Others on Facebook” option and tap on it.
 
5. Select “Don’t receive requests.”
 
This should unlink your Instagram DMs from Facebook Messager and prevent others you’ve chatted with on Messenger from sending you requests. 
 
## How to Unlink Your Instagram and Facebook Accounts
 
If, for whatever reason, you don’t want to have the two apps connected anymore, you can unlink your Instagram from Facebook quite easily. Just note that you won’t be able to use the hybrid DMs – Messenger experience if you do. Obviously, it won’t be possible to post on Instagram and Facebook at the same time if you go through with it. What’s more, you’ll stop seeing Instagram’s suggestions to follow your Facebook friends on IG. If you’re ready to disconnect the two, follow the instructions below.

## Frequently Asked Questions
 
### 1. Why can’t I upgrade to the Instagram – Facebook hybrid messaging experience?
 
It seems the feature is not yet available in all regions. While the option was launched back in September 2020, and Facebook mentioned plans to expand it globally, it’s still not available on a wider scale.
 
### 2. How can I share select Instagram posts to Facebook without enabling the auto feature?
 
You can simply toggle the “Also post” option in Facebook from the “New Post” page. As for Stories, there’s a “Share to Facebook” button once you’ve posted the Story on Instagram. Use that to send it directly to Facebook.
 
### 3. Can I connect other social accounts to Instagram?
 
Yes, you can. You will have to go to “Settings -> Account -> Sharing to other apps” and add accounts from there. You can link your Twitter, Tumblr, Ameba or OK.ru profiles.
 
Using Instagram together with Facebook may help you attract more followers to your page, so if you’re looking to boost your audience, you will probably benefit.
