Unleash The Secret Technique To Catching Azelf With Balms in Pokemon Legends Arceus- Never Miss A Legendary Again!

The world of Pokemon Legends Arceus is filled with mythical creatures and legendary beings, each possessing unique abilities and powers. Among these legendary creatures is Azelf, a powerful psychic-type Pokemon known for its incredible speed and agility.

Catching Azelf can be a daunting challenge, especially for new players, but fear not! There’s a secret technique that can help you catch Azelf every time without fail. Here's how:

1. Build Up Your Team

Before you even attempt to catch Azelf, you need to make sure you have a strong and balanced team. Ensure that you have Pokemon that are effective against psychic-type Pokemon, such as Dark, Ghost, or Bug types. You can also bring a Pokemon that knows the False Swipe move to help you weaken Azelf without knocking it out.

2. Prepare Your Items

Azelf is a notoriously difficult Pokemon to catch, but you can increase your chances by using the right items. First, stock up on Ultra Balls and Dusk Balls, as these are the most effective pokeballs for catching legendary Pokemon. Next, obtain some status effect-inducing balm items, such as the Sleep Balm or Poison Balm. These will help to weaken Azelf and make it easier to catch.

3. The Balm Method

The secret to catching Azelf lies in using the Balm method. Begin by battling Azelf and weakening it until it has low health, but do not knock it out. Once Azelf is weakened, use a Sleep Balm or Poison Balm to inflict a status effect. These balms will drastically reduce the chances of Azelf escaping or dodging your pokeballs.

Now that Azelf is weakened and afflicted with a status effect, it's time to start throwing your pokeballs. Start with a Dusk Ball, as these pokeballs have a higher catch rate in dark environments. If you don't catch Azelf, use an Ultra Ball next. Keep throwing pokeballs until you catch Azelf or run out of balls.

By following these steps, you'll be able to catch Azelf with ease and never miss a legendary Pokemon again! Remember to stock up on items, build a strong team, and use the Balm method to weaken and catch Azelf. With a bit of patience and persistence, you'll be able to catch every legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Legends Arceus.

Towards the end of Pokemon Legends Arceus, you will be tasked with hitting Azelf with balms. You will receive this task from either one of three legendary Pokemon you need to visit. You will find these Pokemon in hidden caves under three lakes. While the task may sound easy enough, it turns out there is more to it than meets the eye. This makes the mission rather tricky, which is why we have got just the guide for you. Here, we will show you all you need to do to hit Azelf with a balm.
 
## How to Hit Azelf with Balms in Pokemon Legends Arceus?
 

 
In order to successfully hit Azelf with balms in Pokemon Legends Arceus, you need to keep trying to hit him over and over again. Due to Azelf’s tendency to teleport upon being hit, getting a clean shot is next to impossible.
 
Because of this, the real trick lies in simply attempting to throw the balm at him, and not at actually hitting him. After you miss a few times, you will receive a prompt that asks you if you wish to give up. You need to reply in the negative and keep going. Repeat the process of trying until you receive the said prompt thrice.
 
Upon replying in the negative for the third time, you will successfully complete this mission. Yes, that really is it. Turns out, this mission is not about actually hitting Azelf with balms at all. The mission actually is all about persistence. And while this premise may initially appear as a little cheesy, it actually sounds quite fun. Players unaware of the premise of this quest will simply quit, completely unaware of what lies ahead after a few more attempts.
 
So there you have it. This is all you need to know about how to hit Azelf with a balm in Pokemon Legends Arceus. As you can see, the entire quest is actually completely different once you start playing it.
 
And now that you know all about this quest, take a look at our Pokemon Legends Arceus Guides.
