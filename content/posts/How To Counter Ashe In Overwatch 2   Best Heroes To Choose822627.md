Are you tired of getting defeated by Ashe in Overwatch? Fear not, as we’ve got a solution for you. In this article, we’ll discuss the game-changing heroes that you can use to counter Ash and achieve victory in Overwatch.

Ashe is a fierce opponent with long-range weapons, lethal dynamite attacks, and a powerful ultimate that calls down a giant Bob to wreak havoc. But, with the right hero choices, you can take down Ashe and give your team a fighting chance. 

So, let’s get started with the heroes that can make a difference:

1. Pharah: 

Pharah is a good pick to counter Ashe due to her vertical mobility, which allows her to fly above the battlefield and rain down rockets on her opponents. 

As Ashe’s dynamite has a long cooldown, Pharah can also take advantage of Ashe’s vulnerability during this time. She can quickly burst Ashe with her rockets before she has time to recover.

2. Reaper:

Reaper can be an excellent counter to Ashe due to his mobility and significant damage output. His wraith form can be used to get out of harm’s way or close the gap between himself and Ashe. His shotguns can quickly shred her health pool.

3. Winston: 

Winston is a great choice for players who prefer a more strategy-focused approach to countering Ashe. His jump pack allows him to easily engage Ashe, and he can use his bubble shield to protect himself and his teammates from Ashe’s dynamite.

4. Tracer: 

Tracer is a high-mobility hero that can disrupt Ashe and her team with her fast movement speed and blink ability. She can also take advantage of Ashe's long reload time to land critical hits on her, dealing significant damage.

5. Sombra: 

Sombra's ability to hack Ashe and render her abilities useless make her an excellent hero pick to counter Ashe. She can also use her invisibility and teleportation abilities to get behind Ashe and quickly take her out.

6. Widowmaker:

Widowmaker’s long-range sniper rifle makes her an ideal pick to take out Ashe from a distance. Her ultimate ability, Infra-Sight, provides her team with wallhacks that can quickly find Ashe and her teammates, making it easier to take them out.

In conclusion, to counter Ashe in Overwatch, you must choose the right hero that suits your play style. Each of the above-listed heroes can take down Ashe if used correctly. So, go ahead and unleash your inner Overwatch champion by picking the right hero to crush Ashe and achieve victory for your team. 

Good luck and have fun playing Overwatch!

## Best Counters for Ashe in Overwatch 2
 
### Soldier: 76
 
The only thing Ashe struggles at more often than not is winning short-range battles. With a semi-automatic rifle at her disposal, Ashe’s weapon is no match for Soldier: 76’s Pulse Rifle. The fully automatic assault rifle can get the better of Ashe’s single shots. Ultimately, Soldier: 76 can kill Ashe in most close-range 1v1 duels.
 
### Widowmaker
 
Widowmaker has the upper hand over Ashe in Overwatch 2. Blessed with no bullet drop or damage fall off and hitscan, she can often out-snipe Ashe and kill her with ease. All this, while also having the ability to outflank Ashe due to better mobility, Widowmaker is truly one of the hardest counters to Ashe in Overwatch 2.
 
### Sombra
 
Sombra can make short work of Ashe by disabling B.O.B. He is a deployable robot-butler who charges forward to launch enemies into the sky and then explodes them with his arm cannons. However, when B.O.B. comes up against Sombra- the world’s most cunning hacker – his efforts are futile. Sombra can easily ride override B.O.B.’s system, thereby ruling out a powerful asset for Ashe’s team
 
She might be a “Jack of all trades” character but only in the right hands! Learning to understand Ashe’s mechanics and abilities can take a lot of time to understand.
