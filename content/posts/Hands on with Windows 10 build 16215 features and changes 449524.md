# You won't believe the game-changing features in Windows 10 Build 16215 - our hands-on experience will blow your mind!

As technology advances, it's only natural for software developers to constantly improve software to meet growing user demands. Microsoft has taken this idea to heart, and it shows with the latest build of Windows 10, Build 16215.

We got our hands on Build 16215 and were blown away by the game-changing features added to the operating system. Here's a rundown of some of the most notable changes:

## Fluent design system

Microsoft has introduced a brand new design system, called Fluent Design, to Windows 10. Fluent Design is designed to make it easier to create immersive experiences across devices, by introducing new UI elements, animations, and behaviors.

The new design system is being used throughout the operating system, from the Start menu to the Settings app. The design is sleek, modern, and is sure to please many users.

## Microsoft Edge improvements

Microsoft's Edge browser is now more powerful than ever with the update. There is now a new full-screen mode, allowing users to remove all distractions and focus only on the content – perfect for reading articles or browsing photos. Microsoft has also added the ability to annotate PDFs without leaving the browser, using a built-in PDF viewer.

Edge now also supports e-books, with a new e-book store built into the browser. Users can browse and purchase e-books directly from the app, and start reading them right away.

## OneDrive files on demand

OneDrive has always been one of the most convenient features of Windows 10, allowing users to access their files from anywhere. Now, Microsoft has made it even better with the "Files on Demand" feature.

Files on Demand allows users to access all their OneDrive files, without actually storing them on their device. This means you can access files without taking up precious storage space, but still have complete control and visibility over all your files.

## Game mode improvements

Windows 10 has always been a great platform for gamers, and the latest update has only made it better. Game Mode, a feature introduced in a previous update, now gets a slight improvement which allows it to be controlled individually for each game. This means that you can now turn Game Mode on or off for individual games, providing a more customizable gaming experience.

## Cortana improvements

Cortana has been a key feature of Windows 10 since its introduction, and the latest update makes it even more powerful. The digital assistant is now integrated with the OneDrive Files on Demand feature, allowing users to search for and open files directly from Cortana.

Cortana also now integrates with Microsoft's Groove Music service, allowing users to voice control their music playback. You can ask Cortana to play specific songs, albums, or even genres, making it easier than ever to enjoy your favorite tunes.

Overall, we were extremely impressed with the latest update to Windows 10. The new features and improvements truly enhance the user experience, adding new levels of customization and convenience. If you're a Windows 10 user, we highly recommend updating to Build 16215 – the game-changing features will blow your mind!
