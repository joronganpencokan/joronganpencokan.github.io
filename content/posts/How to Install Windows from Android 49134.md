# Unleash The Power: Install Windows From Your Android And Take Control Of Your PC Like Never Before!

Are you tired of your limited PC functionality? Do you wish you had the freedom to install your favorite operating system, such as Windows, without the need for a bootable USB or CD? Well, with Android and a few simple steps, you can install Windows on your PC like never before.

Gone are the days when you needed a separate USB or CD to install an operating system. Today, it’s possible to install Windows on your PC using just your Android smartphone. In this article, we’ll take you through the steps to install Windows on your PC using an Android device.

## Requirements

Before we delve into the installation process, you’ll need to meet some requirements to ensure a seamless installation. First, ensure that your Android device has enough space to store the Windows installation files. You’ll also need a USB OTG cable to connect your phone to your PC. Additionally, you’ll need a stable internet connection, as well as a Windows ISO file and a file manager app on your Android device.

## Step 1: Download the required files

The first step to installing Windows on your PC via Android is to download the necessary files. Start by downloading a Windows ISO file and save it to your device’s internal storage or microSD card. Next, download a file manager app on your Android device if you don’t have one.

## Step 2: Connect your phone to your PC

After downloading the Windows ISO file and the file manager, you need to connect your phone to the PC using a USB OTG cable. Once connected, open the file manager app on your Android device and locate the Windows ISO file.

## Step 3: Extract the ISO file

When you locate the Windows ISO file, extract it to a folder on your Android device. This process may take some time depending on the size of the ISO file.

## Step 4: Install a VNC app on your Android device

Now, you’ll need to install a VNC app on your Android device. This app will allow you to control your PC remotely from your phone. Some great options include TeamViewer or VNC Viewer.

## Step 5: Create a bootable USB drive

Next, create a bootable USB drive on your PC that you’ll use to install Windows. To do this, insert a USB drive into the PC and format it to FAT32. Then, copy the extracted Windows ISO files to the USB drive.

## Step 6: Enable USB boot on your PC

Before installing Windows from the USB drive, you need to enable USB boot on your PC. To do this, restart your PC and enter BIOS mode by pressing a specific key (usually F10, F12, or Del, depending on your PC model). Next, go to the “Boot” tab and enable “USB Boot.”

## Step 7: Boot from the USB drive

Once you’ve enabled USB boot on your PC, restart the computer and boot from the USB drive you created in step 5. You should then see the Windows installation screen on your PC.

## Step 8: Connect your phone to your PC

Now, connect your phone to your PC using the same USB OTG cable you used earlier. This time, however, open the VNC app you installed in step 4 on your Android device to control your PC remotely.

## Step 9: Complete the Windows installation process

Using your phone, control your PC remotely and complete the Windows installation process. You’ll need to enter your Windows product key, choose your installation type and wait for the installation to complete. Once done, you’ll be able to enjoy the power and functionality of Windows on your PC!

## Conclusion

In conclusion, you don’t need a bootable USB or CD to install Windows on your PC today. With Android and a few simple steps, you can install Windows on your computer using just your phone. Follow the steps outlined above and take control of your PC’s functionality like never before.

USB flash drives are very useful, but not everyone has one, and it is not always possible to lay your hands on a Windows recovery disk every time you want to install Windows on your PC.
 
Thanks to DriveDroid, you can install Windows from Android. It only takes a few minutes to set it up.
 
## Requirements
 
Before you proceed with this tutorial, ensure that you have the following things in place:
 
- A rooted Android device (Magisk and SuperSU work well for this – always back up your device before rooting)4.5GB or more free space on your Android deviceThe Windows ISO file

 
## Setup
 
First, you need to install DriveDroid or DriveDroid Paid on your device. Launch the Google Play Store app on your device, search for “DriveDroid” and install from there. It’s important to note that the current free version works best with Android 9 devices. However, it’s still one of the best options, despite not being updated for a while. 
 
Once you have it installed, you can run the USB setup wizard to configure the application. Hit “Setup” to begin.
 
It will verify that your device has not been blacklisted. Tap “Proceed,” then grant the app root access.
 
Next, connect your Android device to a PC using a USB cable.
 
You need to choose from a list of USB systems for handling USB. Most devices will work with the first available USB system.
 
Finally, open the file manager on your PC and confirm whether your device is mounted as a USB drive or CD drive. This indicates that your device works well with DriveDroid. You may close the Wizard and proceed with the rest of the tutorial.
 
If your device doesn’t show up at all, head back to the previous page and try other USB systems until one works.
 
## Create a Bootable Windows Image
 
Once you have scaled the initial setup, creating a bootable Windows ISO on your Android device should be a walk in the park.
 
Follow the below-listed steps and make sure your device remains connected to your PC before continuing.
 
- Download the latest Windows 10 ISO file or Windows 11 ISO file and move it to your device’s internal storage or SD Card.Launch DriveDroid and hit the “+” button at the bottom of the screen.Select “Add image from file.”

 
- Name your image and tap the magnifying glass icon to select the path of the ISO file. Once done, tap the checkmark at the top to save.

 
- Tap the newly-created entry and select one of the hosting options. “CD-ROM” worked for me in this case.

 
- Your Windows image should be mounted now. A notification will appear on your phone indicating the the image was successfully mounted.

 
- Finally, reboot your PC and boot from the Drive where your Windows ISO is mounted.

 
You may need to enter the boot menu if your PC isn’t set to boot from external devices or disks first. During the boot process, press F8, F11, or Del (the button varies based on your PC) to access the boot menu. Choose the UEFI option with a name that usually starts with Linux File-CD. 
 
That’s it! Windows should boot normally, and you will be able to continue the installation process from there.
 
## Frequently Asked Questions
 
### 1. Will this cause any data loss on my Android device?
 
It shouldn’t. As long as you perform the root process correctly and have ample space on your device, you shouldn’t lose any files, apps, or settings. However, always back up your device first. If you’re worried, consider using an old Android device instead if there is one available.
 
### 2. Will DriveDroid let me boot other operating systems?
 
Yes. It’s actually designed for letting you boot Linux systems directly from your Android device so that you don’t have to install them on your PC. For example, if you wanted to give Linux a test drive before creating a dual-boot system on your PC, use DriveDroid to install a Linux distro on your Android device and boot directly into it by connecting your Android device to your PC via USB.
 
If you’re not sure which Linux distros to try, check out some of the best Linux distros for Windows users.
 
### 3. Can I delete the Windows ISO once I’m finished?
 
Absolutely! Once Windows is successfully installed on your PC, you no longer need the Windows ISO on your Android device. Feel free to delete it to save space. 
 
### 4. Is there a big difference between DriveDroid and DriveDroid Paid?
 
While I personally had no issues with the free version of DriveDroid on Android 12, some users have reported having better success on Android 11 devices using the paid version. 
 
### 5. Will DriveDroid let me run Windows from Android?
 
While you can run Linux systems, you can’t run Windows fully from Android using DriveDroid. This is only to start the installation process. This works the same as creating a recovery or installation media on a DVD or USB drive.
