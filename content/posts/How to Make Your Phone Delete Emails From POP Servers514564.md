Revolutionize Your Email Inbox: Learn How To Automatically Delete Emails From Pop Servers on Your Phone!

Email has become an essential part of our lives. We use it for everything from work to personal communication, but it can quickly become overwhelming with the number of emails we receive daily. While it's necessary to keep up with our inbox, some messages just aren't important, and they take up precious storage space. It's time to take control of your email inbox and learn how to automatically delete emails from POP servers on your phone.

POP (Post Office Protocol) servers are the primary means of accessing email on mobile devices, but storing too many emails can slow down your phone's performance. For instance, your business email might receive a lot of automated messages that aren't essential. You can easily set up rules to delete such messages automatically, freeing up space and improving your phone's performance.

So, how do you set up an automatic deletion rule for POP server emails on your phone? Here's a quick guide to help you get started:

1. Open your email app, and locate the settings tab.

2. Scroll down to Rules, Filters, or Filters and Sorting, depending on your email app.

3. Click on Add a Rule, Create a Filter or Create a New Rule.

4. Name your rule by identifying its purpose, such as unwanted marketing emails.

5. Define the specific conditions that will trigger the rule. For instance, emails containing specific words like "promo," "offer," or "sale." You might also specify the sender's address or any other filtering criteria you prefer.

6. Next, determine what happens when the rule conditions are met. You can either delete the message entirely or move it to a designated folder.

7. Save your rule and exit the settings page.

Now, your email app will automatically detect incoming messages that meet the rule's condition and delete or move them according to your preference. This way, your inbox will be more organized, and you can focus on the most important emails without being distracted by irrelevant messages.

Keep in mind that setting up an automatic deletion rule on POP servers may also delete emails from other devices that use the same email account. So, carefully choose conditions that won't harm your overall email management. 

In conclusion, automatically deleting emails from POP servers on your phone can help you manage your inbox more efficiently. Customized rules will filter out unwanted messages from your inbox, leaving only essential communications. So, take control of your email inbox and get started with automatic email deletion rules today!

IMAP synchronizes the email on your smartphone with the emails on the server. In contrast, POP downloads messages to the phone and leaves a copy on the server. Learn how to remove the deleted messages from the server using Gmail, but the steps are similar for Outlook, Yahoo, and other email providers.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Go to Gmail Settings > See all settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP > When messages are accessed with POP. Choose an option.POP settings include: Keep Gmail's copy in the Inbox, Mark Gmail's copy as read, Archive Gmail's copy, and Delete Gmail's copy.The only way to delete emails from all your devices at once is to set up each device with your provider's IMAP server.

 
##   How to Keep or Delete Mail From POP Servers  
 

If you use POP and want to remove the deleted messages from the server, either delete those messages again from a computer or change the email settings so that the server deletes mail after it downloads to your phone.

 

Here's how to change those settings in the browser version of Gmail.

 
- On a desktop computer or laptop, open a web browser and go to Gmail.
 - This will work in a mobile browser, but you must force the page to load the desktop version of the website to see the correct menu items and make the server changes.
 - Select Settings (the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the page).
 - Choose See all settings.
 - Select the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab, or use this link if you can't find it.
 - In the POP download section, select the When messages are accessed with POP drop-down menu.
 - If you can't select this menu, choose one of the Enable POP options just above it.
 - Choose one of these options:
 - Keep Gmail's copy in the Inbox: When an email is deleted from the phone, the message is removed from that device but remains in your account. The message stays on the server and can be accessed from any device.Mark Gmail's copy as read: Deleted messages remain in your mail account, but the messages are marked as read. If you delete a message on your phone and then open Gmail on a PC, the message downloads to the PC and is marked to show that you read the message on another device.Archive Gmail's copy: Emails remain in your account when you download or delete them from your device. Deleted emails are moved from the Inbox folder to an archive folder.Delete Gmail's copy: Messages that download to your phone are deleted from the server. The mail remains on the device as long as it isn't deleted. However, it won't be available online when you log in to Gmail from a computer or another device. Use this option when you're running out of available storage in your online account.
 - Select Save Changes. Emails on the server will now behave in the way you specified in Step 6.

 
##   Delete Emails From All Devices at Once  
 

When you access email from a POP server, the email app can't make changes to the emails on the server. This is unlike IMAP, which controls the server emails from the device.

 

On a desktop computer or laptop, open a web browser and go to Gmail.

 
This will work in a mobile browser, but you must force the page to load the desktop version of the website to see the correct menu items and make the server changes.
 

Select Settings (the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the page).

 

Choose See all settings.

 

Select the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab, or use this link if you can't find it.

 

In the POP download section, select the When messages are accessed with POP drop-down menu.

 
If you can't select this menu, choose one of the Enable POP options just above it.
 

Choose one of these options:

 
- Keep Gmail's copy in the Inbox: When an email is deleted from the phone, the message is removed from that device but remains in your account. The message stays on the server and can be accessed from any device.Mark Gmail's copy as read: Deleted messages remain in your mail account, but the messages are marked as read. If you delete a message on your phone and then open Gmail on a PC, the message downloads to the PC and is marked to show that you read the message on another device.Archive Gmail's copy: Emails remain in your account when you download or delete them from your device. Deleted emails are moved from the Inbox folder to an archive folder.Delete Gmail's copy: Messages that download to your phone are deleted from the server. The mail remains on the device as long as it isn't deleted. However, it won't be available online when you log in to Gmail from a computer or another device. Use this option when you're running out of available storage in your online account.

 

Select Save Changes. Emails on the server will now behave in the way you specified in Step 6.

 

For example, if you use Gmail's POP servers on your phone and you chose Keep Gmail's copy in the Inbox, emails are downloaded to your phone and kept online. The messages are kept on your phone and on the server until you delete them. Even if you change Gmail's settings to make the POP server delete Gmail's copy from the server, the messages aren't removed from your device.

 

The only way to delete emails from all your devices at once is to set up each device with your provider's IMAP server. That way, you can log in to any device that has direct server access via IMAP (your tablet, phone, or computer) and delete emails there. When messages are removed from the server, every device deletes the locally stored emails when the device requests an update from the IMAP server.
