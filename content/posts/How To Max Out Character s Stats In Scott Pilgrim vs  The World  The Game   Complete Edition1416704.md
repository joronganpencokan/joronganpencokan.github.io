## How To Maximize Character’s Stats In Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game – Complete Edition
 
Maximizing your character in Scott Pilgrim Vs is not straightforward. To do so, you will have to head over to the Shopping District housed on level one. After taking down all of the enemies, go to the ‘Delicious Cup’ coffee shop.
 
After entering the coffee shop, you will have to order something from the menu. Notably, having a snack in your inventory will prevent you from losing lives after you input the following Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World: The Game cheat code.
 

 
You will have to repeat the same process until you have got the required money $504.25. Once you cheated your way to the top, you will need to go to the No Account Video tap and pay off Scott’s late fees $504.25. Now, there are multiple videotape boosters will appear on the screen and each one has a specific bonus attached to it.
 
What all you need to do is to focus on buying merely two updates. The first videotape that you will have to purchase is called Seven Shaolin Masters, which will increase your stats by 10 points. If you are on Level one, buy it 10 times to max out your stats to 100.
 
The second videotape that you should purchase is ‘Alone and Disturb’, which will give you bonus 1500 XP boost. You will have to purchase sufficient videotapes to unlock all the moves through level 16 and watch your foes quake in fear.
 
That’s everything you need to know about how to max up your character in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game – Complete Edition.
