Title: Breaking News: GTA Fans Rejoice! Analyst Predicts GTA 6 Release Window Soon, Could It Be 2023 or 2024? Find Out Here!

The Grand Theft Auto (GTA) franchise has been a top-rated game series for over two decades, with the latest installment, GTA 5, breaking several records since its release in 2013. Fans of the game have been eagerly anticipating the release of GTA 6, eagerly awaiting the announcement of its release. Over the years, rumors and speculations about its release date have circulated, leading to a lot of disappointment when the official release announcement failed to happen. However, a recent report by an industry analyst has given GTA fans hope of seeing the game in the near future.

According to Jeff Cohen, a senior research analyst at investment firm Stephens Inc., Rockstar Games, the developer of GTA, is likely to announce the release window for GTA 6 soon. In a recent note to investors, Cohen suggested that the game might be released by Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of Rockstar Games, between 2023 and 2024.

Cohen arrived at his conclusion after analyzing Rockstar Games' marketing expenses, which he believed showed an increase in spending in the last few years. He suggested that this uptick in advertising cost was likely to be related to the development and promotion of GTA 6, indicating an imminent release.

While the revelation from Cohen has stirred excitement among GTA fans, it is still just speculation, and it is important to take it with a grain of salt. Rockstar Games has not released any official announcement regarding the release date of GTA 6 nor confirmed Cohen's prediction.

However, the idea of a 2023 or 2024 release date aligns with previous rumors and speculations. Back in 2018, a Reddit user claimed to have inside knowledge that the game was in the early stages of production and would not be released until 2022 or 2023. Additionally, in 2020, a Rockstar Games insider suggested that the game's release was slated for 2023.

GTA 6's expected release window is promising, but it remains unclear which consoles will feature the game. With the release of new gaming systems like PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, Rockstar Games may decide to make the game exclusive to these new consoles. Alternatively, they could also make it available on the previous gaming systems like PS4 and Xbox One.

In conclusion, Jeff Cohen's note to investors has sparked hope for the long-awaited release of GTA 6, with predictions pointing to a 2023 or 2024 window. While this news is exciting, it is important to keep in mind that it remains speculation until Rockstar Games makes an official announcement. Until then, GTA fans can keep their fingers crossed and hope that Jeff Cohen's prediction aligns with the much-awaited reality.


GTA is one of the most beloved franchises in the entertainment world. This is why video gamers are eager to know something about its next installment, which seems inevitable. While the project remains unconfirmed, a new rumor seems to indicate that GTA 6 could debut before April 2024.
 
According to reports, in its financial reports, Take-Two, the company that owns Rockstar Games, revealed that for the fiscal year 2024 (it will be from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024) it has a marketing budget that amounts to at $89.2 million. This figure is more than double than any advertising budget of any other year in the next five years.
 
A company like Take-Two planning such a big budget for a year indicates that a very important game could debut in this period. This suggests that GTA 6 could be planned to be one of its releases for the fiscal year 2024. It should be mentioned that this budget was intended for the fiscal year 2023, but was moved to the fiscal year 2024 in the most recent report.
 
Keep in mind that this is not a theory of fans, but of analysts of the video game industry. We say this since Jeff Cohen from investment firm Stephens noted that a budget increase like this has happened with other Rockstar Games releases, such as Red Dead Redemption 2.
 
“We are not sure how much we should be reading into this shift, but we would note that this disclosure accurately predicted the launch of Red Dead Redemption 2 prior to that game’s announcement,” said Cohen. “[Take-Two management] has spoken very confidently about the pipeline over the next five years and existing live services execution has been excellent. However, the timing of the next Grand Theft Auto remains top-of-mind for investors, particularly with the stock near all-time-highs.”
 
It also makes sense that Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive will prefer to wait for next-gen consoles to be well established and with a good strong user base. After all, they are in no rush to release another installment after the success of GTA V and GTA Online.
