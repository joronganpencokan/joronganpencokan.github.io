You Won't Believe How This Simple Trick Solves the Statue Puzzle in Temple of Light in God of War Ragnarok!

The Temple of Light in God of War Ragnarok has been one of the most challenging areas for players. The massive temple, filled with obstacles and puzzles, has kept players on their toes. One of the most notorious challenges players face in the Temple of Light is the Statue Puzzle. It is a complex puzzle that involves multiple statues that have to be correctly aligned, and it has been a nuisance for many players. However, using a simple trick, players can quickly solve this puzzle and move on to the next challenge.

The Solution

The first thing players must do is to approach the puzzle area and assess the statues. Notice the symbols on top of each statue: one has a symbol of a hand, and the other has a symbol of an open book. Remember or take note of the location of the statues.

After taking note of the statue positions, interact with the wheel in front of the puzzle. Turn the wheel to move the light to the statue with the hand symbol.

When the light shines on the statue with the hand symbol, press the circle button to make Atreus shoot an arrow at it. The statue will then lift its hand.

While the light is still on the statue with the hand symbol, turn the wheel to move the light to the statue with the open book symbol. The light beam from the wheel should shine on the open book statue.

Once the light shines on the statue with the open book symbol, it will open the book. Keep the light on the statue and take note of the location of the statue's right-hand side.

With the light still shining on the statue with the open book symbol, turn the wheel to move the light towards the location of the right-hand side of the statue. The light beam will now shine on the back of the statue, where a hidden button will light up.

Shoot the hidden button with Atreus' arrow, and the puzzle will be solved, allowing access to the next part of the Temple of Light.

Conclusion

The Statue Puzzle in the Temple of Light in God of War Ragnarok has been the source of frustration for many players. However, with this simple trick, players can navigate the puzzle and access the next part of the temple with ease. Remember to keep track of the statue positions, use the wheel to move the light to the statue with the hand symbol, shoot the raised hand to lift it, move the light to the open book statue, shoot the open book statue to open it, take note of the right-hand side of the statue, move the light to the side with the right-hand, and shoot the hidden button on the back of the statue.

Solving puzzles is one of the things that make God of War Ragnarok an exciting game. With this simple trick to solve the Statue Puzzle in the Temple of Light, players can now show off their puzzle-solving skills to friends and experience the thrill of moving on to the next challenge in the game.
