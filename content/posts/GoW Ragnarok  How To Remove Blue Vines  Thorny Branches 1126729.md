Title: Gow Ragnarok Secrets Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Eliminating Blue Vines & Thorny Branches!

Attention all players! If you're struggling to eliminate those pesky Blue Vines and Thorny Branches in Gow Ragnarok, then you've come to the right place. In this guide, we'll reveal the ultimate secrets to eliminate these pesky obstacles so that you can progress through the game with ease.

Before we dive into the tips, let's briefly discuss what the Blue Vines and Thorny Branches are and why they are causing so much trouble in the game.

Blue Vines are plants that have a blue-colored flower and can be found on walls, floors, and ceilings. They release poisonous gas that can damage your character's health if you get too close. Thorny Branches, on the other hand, are sharp branches that you need to break with your weapon to progress further in the game.

Now that we understand the problem let's move on to the solutions!

1. Use Your Weapon

The easiest way to eliminate Blue Vines and Thorny Branches is by attacking them with your weapon. You can use any weapon to get rid of them, but it's better to use an axe or a sword since they have a broader attacking range. Once you hit blue vines or thorny branches, they will break into smaller pieces, and you can move forward.

2. Use Shock Arrows

Shock Arrows are a type of special arrows that you can craft from the crafting menu. These arrows will not only break the Thorny Branches but also stun nearby enemies, giving you a chance to attack or run.

3. Cast Atreus' Shock Arrows

Atreus is a great companion in Gow Ragnarok, and he can use a variety of arrows. To break Blue Vines, Atreus can cast Shock Arrows that will instantly get away these stubborn plants from your path.

4. Use the Blades of Chaos

The Blades of Chaos are a powerful weapon in Gow Ragnarok that can break through Blue Vines and Thorny Branches. You can use the chains to swing the blades and attack enemies, but they also work wonders against obstacles.

5. Use the Spartan Rage Ability

Spartan Rage is a unique ability that Kratos has, which makes him nearly invincible for a short time. You can use this ability to break Blue Vines and Thorny Branches easily since they can't damage you while in Spartan Rage mode.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Blue Vines and Thorny Branches can be frustrating obstacles in Gow Ragnarok, but using the above-mentioned tactics can help you get rid of them with ease. Remember, sometimes it's better to avoid the plants than attack them, especially if you're running low on health. So, stay focused, use your senses, and don't forget to have fun!

All the paths leading anywhere in this game are filled with adventurous obstacles awaiting you to remove them. These obstacles can be tricky puzzles or twisted ways that may slow you down in getting your hands on rewards or reaching a certain location. The most common obstacle you will come across throughout the game is Blue Vines. This thorny branch in God of War Ragnarok can be found while being in the early period. If you have missed the tutorial somehow and are unable to clear them, then this article got you covered. Check out this guide that features the steps to clear out the blue vines in GoW Ragnarok.
 
## How to Remove the Blue Vines in GoW Ragnarok
 

 
In order to clear your path, you can burn the blue vines or thorny branches with the help of Blades of Chaos. Kratos’s Blades of Chaos holds the strongest flames that can burn the toughest metals to ash. All you have to do is press the left button on the d-pad on your controller to equip the Blades of Chaos. Further, press and hold L2 to aim toward the blue vines obstructing your path in GoW Ragnarok. Press R2 when you are ready to burn down the thorny branches.
 
In the later parts of the game, you will come across blur vines that are far beyond the reach of Blades of Chaos. In such cases, you can use Sigil Arrows and make them detonate so they get burnt. For this to happen, simply shoot 3 Sigil Arrows close to each other so that they get chained. You will know the job is done correctly if the middle one shines brighter. For those who don’t know Sigil Area when chained together covers a specific area with purple color. You can use Blades of Chaos to touch that area causing the chain to detonate which will remove the blue vines near it in GoW Ragnarok.
