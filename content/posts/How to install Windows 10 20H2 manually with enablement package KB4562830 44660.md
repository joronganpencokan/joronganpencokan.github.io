The October 2020 Update for Windows 10 (version 20H2) is now slowly rolling out to compatible devices, and while the recommended way to install the feature update is using the Windows Update service, you can also download and install the enablement package (KB4562830) manually using the standalone installer.
 
This option is only available for devices running version 2004. If you’re using version 1909 or an older release, you can’t use the enablement package to upgrade. The reason is that Windows 10 version 2004 and 20H2 have a common core system with the same system files. As a result the new set of features have already been deployed in a dormant state to computers running version 2004 using quality updates throughout the year. These new features will remain inactive until the KB4562830 update is installed, which is what Microsoft is rolling out to users starting October 20.
 
Using this approach significantly reduces the time to upgrade from version 2004 to version 20H2, and lowers the restart times to only one.
 
In this guide, you’ll learn the steps to download and install the enablement package manually to upgrade your device to Windows 10 20H2.
 
## Install Windows 10 20H2 enablement package on version 2004
 
While it’s a good idea to wait until the device receives the update automatically, this option will come in handy in many scenarios. For instance, if it’s been sometime and your computer is not getting the feature update through Windows Update and you’re sure that your hardware configuration is compatible. You want to test the update on a spare computer before upgrading your primary device, or you can’t wait until the new version arrives automatically.
 
### Requirements
 
According to the Microsoft support website, the device must have the quality updates released on September 8 and October 13 or later releases before you can apply the enablement package. 
 
You can make sure your computer has the latest updates on Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update, and clicking the Check for updates button.

 - Click the Yes button.
