Introduction

Sony's PlayStation 3 is a powerhouse of gaming perfection, and its wireless capabilities are impressive. However, many users don't realize that there are hidden wireless gems in their PS3 that make their gaming experience better. This guide will show gamers how to unlock these gems and take their gaming experience to the ultimate level.

Step 1: Upgrade Your Wireless Router

Your PS3 is only as good as your wireless network. An old or outdated wireless router won't give you the fast and reliable connection you need. Investing in a new wireless router that supports the latest wireless standards (802.11ac) will provide faster and more stable connections. Additionally, it's also worth considering purchasing a router with a higher bandwidth capacity as PS3 games can have very data-intensive multiplayer modes.

Step 2: Connect to Wired Ethernet

While the PS3 is a wireless gaming console, there's still an option to connect to wired Ethernet to obtain a faster and more reliable connection. Some PS3 gamers prefer to connect their console directly to their router with an Ethernet cable. Although wireless connections work well in most places, you can still anticipate some issues, particularly if multiple people are using the same network.

Step 3: Switch to Netplay

PS3's Netplay feature is an excellent way to reduce lag, particularly when you're playing online multiplayer games. It works by establishing a direct and faster connection between consoles, allowing multiplayer games to function in peer-to-peer style. Netplay feature allows gamers to connect with each other directly and exclusively, avoiding lag issues with other gamers on the same network.

Step 4: Specify Your DNS Settings

Your ISP's DNS server might not always provide the quickest and most efficient connection to PlayStation Network. However, you can take matters into your own hands and specify your DNS settings manually. You'll need to know which DNS server to use, but a simple Google search will point you in the right direction.

Step 5: Use Remote Play

Remote Play is a fantastic way to extend your PS3 gaming experience beyond your console's bounds. Remote Play allows you to access your PS3 games remotely by connecting it to a compatible device such as a mobile phone or tablet. This feature is particularly useful if you're traveling frequently or need some extra gaming space outside your living room.

Conclusion

Sony's PS3 is already an all-in-one entertainment device, and the hidden wireless gems on the console make it even better. With just a couple of easy upgrades and tweaks, gamers can take their PS3 experience to the next level. The tips above will help you unlock the power of your PS3's wireless capabilities and make every gaming session more enjoyable.

A Sony PlayStation 3 video game console isn't useful only for gaming. With some software on your computer and a few settings changes, you can stream music and videos from your computer to your PS3 over your home network, as well as participate in the world of online gaming. Many of the most popular games for the console operate entirely over online game servers. Other games usually have an online option. To participate, you need a connection to your home network to reach the internet. It can be either a wired Ethernet connection or a wireless connection. All PS3 consoles can be connected with an Ethernet cable to the internet, but a wireless connection is more convenient for gaming.

 
##   PS3 Wireless Capability  
 

With the exception of the original 20GB model, the PlayStation 3 video game consoles, the PS3 Slim consoles, and the PS3 Super Slim units all include built-in 802.11g (802.11b/g) Wi-Fi wireless networking. You don't need to purchase a separate wireless game adapter to hook up a PS3 to a wireless home network.

 

The PS3 doesn't support the newer Wireless n (802.11n) form of Wi-Fi that is included in PlayStation 4 consoles.

 
##   PS3 vs. Xbox Networking Support  
 

The PS3 networking capability is better than that of the Xbox 360, which offers no built-in wireless networking at all. The Xbox has a built-in 10/100 Ethernet network adapter, but a wireless connection requires an 802.11n or 802.11g adapter that must be purchased separately.
