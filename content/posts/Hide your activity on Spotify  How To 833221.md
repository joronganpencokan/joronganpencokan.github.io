# Discover the Secret Trick to Hide Your Spotify Activity From EVERYONE, Including Your Ex!

Are you tired of your ex stalking your every move on Spotify? Or is your friend always commenting on how terrible your taste in music is? Well, fear no more, because we have the secret trick to hide your Spotify activity from everyone!

First, let's understand how Spotify works. When you listen to music on Spotify, everything you do is recorded in the app's activity feed. This includes the songs you listen to, the playlists you create, and the artists you follow. While this is handy for discovering new music and sharing your favorite tunes with friends, it can also be quite intrusive.

But don't worry, there's a way to keep your activities private. Here's how.

Step 1: Open the Spotify app on your phone or computer.

Step 2: Click on the "Settings" button on the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.

Step 3: Navigate to "Social" under the Settings menu.

Step 4: Toggle off the switch next to "Show my recently played artists on my profile."

Step 5: Repeat step 4 for the "Show the music I listen to on my profile" option.

Congratulations, you have successfully hidden your Spotify activity from others! Now no one will know what you're listening to, and you can jam out to your guilty pleasures in peace.

But wait, there's more! If you want to further enhance your privacy on Spotify, here are a few more tips:

- Create a private session: By clicking on the "Private Session" option in the "Social" settings menu, you can hide your activities for up to six hours.
- Hide your profile: If you don't want anyone to see your Spotify profile at all, you can hide it from the public view by toggling off the "Public Profile" switch in the "View Profile" menu.
- Create a separate account: If you really want to keep your music preferences a secret, consider creating a separate account with a different email address. That way, you can listen to whatever you want without worrying about anyone finding out.

In conclusion, hiding your Spotify activity can be a great way to keep your music preferences private. By following these simple steps, you can ensure that your ex, your friends, or anyone else won't be able to see what you're listening to. So go ahead and jam out to all those guilty pleasures, because no one will ever know!
