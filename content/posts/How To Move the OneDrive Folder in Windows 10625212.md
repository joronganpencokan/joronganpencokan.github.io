Secret Windows 10 Hack Revealed: Move Your OneDrive Folder with Just a Few Clicks!

If you're an avid Windows 10 user, you might know that OneDrive is Microsoft's cloud storage service that comes pre-installed on all Windows 10 computers. It allows you to store files, photos, and other documents in the cloud, so you can access them from anywhere, anytime. However, one of the biggest limitations of OneDrive is that it only allows you to store files in the default folder, which can be a pain if you have limited space on your PC's hard drive. But don't worry, there's a secret Windows 10 hack that allows you to move your OneDrive folder wherever you want with just a few clicks. In this article, we'll show you how.

Step 1: Sign Out of OneDrive

Before you move your OneDrive folder, you need to sign out of your OneDrive account. You can do this by right-clicking the OneDrive icon in your system tray and selecting "Settings." In the Settings tab, click "Account," then click "Unlink this PC." You'll be prompted to confirm that you want to sign out of OneDrive. Click "OK" to proceed.

Step 2: Move Your OneDrive Folder

Now that you're signed out of OneDrive, it's time to move your OneDrive folder. To do this, you need to create a new folder in the location where you want to move your OneDrive files. For example, you might want to create a folder named "OneDrive" on your D: drive.

Once you've created your new folder, you can move your OneDrive files by following these steps:

1. Open File Explorer and navigate to your current OneDrive folder.
2. Right-click the OneDrive folder and select "Properties."
3. In the OneDrive Properties window, select the "Location" tab.
4. Click the "Move" button.
5. Browse to the location of your new OneDrive folder.
6. Select your new OneDrive folder and click "OK."
7. A prompt will appear asking if you want to move all your OneDrive files to the new location. Click "Yes" to proceed.
8. Windows will start moving your OneDrive files to the new location. This may take some time, depending on the size of your OneDrive folder.

Step 3: Sign Back Into OneDrive

Once Windows has finished moving your OneDrive files to the new location, you need to sign back into OneDrive to ensure that everything is working as it should.

1. Launch OneDrive by searching for it in the Start Menu.
2. Enter your Microsoft account credentials and sign in.
3. Once you've signed in, OneDrive should start syncing your files to the new location.

That's it! You've successfully moved your OneDrive folder to a new location on your PC. Now you can free up space on your hard drive and store all your files in a more convenient location.

The OneDrive folder is available by default in Windows 10, and if you are using OneDrive it must be taking some space on your hard drive. If you are lacking space in the drive where OneDrive is installed, then moving the OneDrive folder to another drive might help save some space.
 
However, it is not as simple as cutting and pasting to another drive; you need to make sure the folder syncs all the data. We are going to show you how to properly move the OneDrive folder to another drive and make sure it sync all the previous and future files properly.
 
## Unlink Your Microsoft Account
 
Before you move the OneDrive folder, you must unlink your Microsoft account so it can sync files from the new location when you re-link.
 
1. To do so, right click on the OneDrive icon in the taskbar and select “Settings” from the context menu.
 

 
2. In “Settings” go to the “Account” tab, and you will see an “Unlink OneDrive” button there. Just click on this button, and your account will be immediately unlinked; you will be asked to log in again. For now, minimize this window and follow the next step.
 
## Move the OneDrive Folder
 
Now that your account is unlinked, let’s move the OneDrive folder to your desired folder.
 
1. Go to the directory where your OneDrive folder is located. If you didn’t change the default location, then it should be located in “C:\Users\Your User Name\.”
 
2. Left-click on the OneDrive folder to select it, and then click on “Move-to” in the explorer ribbon. From the drop-down menu, click on “Choose Location” and select the drive and location where you want to move the folder to. It will start moving and will take time depending on how much data you have stored in it.
 
## Set Up OneDrive Again
 
Now that the OneDrive folder has been moved, you need to link your Microsoft Account to OneDrive again and choose a new location for syncing data. Enter the Login details of your Microsoft account in the OneDrive window that you minimized before, and click on “Sign in.”
 
Once you log in you will be shown your OneDrive location with a “Change Location” button below. Click on the “Change Location” button and select the location where you moved the OneDrive folder.
 
A prompt wil ask whether you want to merge the already existing OneDrive folder or whether you want to choose a new location. Here, click on “Use this location” to merge the folder with the old folder. After that just press “Next” to finish up the setup and your OneDrive account will be synced to the new location.
 
## Conclusion
 
The process to move your OneDrive folder isn’t that difficult, but it is important to go through this process to ensure all your previous and new data gets synced properly. It is a great way to save up some considerable space, so going through this little process is probably worth it. Do let us know how moving your OneDrive folder helped you.
