In the popular online game Adopt Me, one of the most coveted items to have in your collection are the epic neon mega pets. These glowing creatures are a status symbol among players and can be incredibly difficult to obtain. But fear not, dear player, for we have unlocked the secrets to creating your very own epic neon mega pet. Your friends will be begging for your tricks!

Step 1: Collect the Necessary Pets

First and foremost, you’ll need to collect the necessary pets to make your epic neon mega pet. This can be a bit tricky as certain pets are rarer than others. However, with a bit of persistence and trading skills, you’ll be able to acquire the pets you need. The pets you’ll need will depend on the type of epic neon mega pet you’re looking to make, but some of the most popular ones include the neon unicorn, the neon frost dragon, and the neon shadow dragon.

Step 2: Level Up Your Pets

Once you have the necessary pets, you’ll need to level them up. The higher the level of the pets, the brighter and more vibrant their neon colors will be. This can be a time-consuming process, but it’s worth it in the end for the stunning results.

Step 3: Make Your Pet Neon

To make your pet neon, you’ll need to acquire neon materials. These can be obtained by purchasing them from other players, trading, or by hatching neon pets. Once you have the materials, simply apply them to your levelled up pets and watch as they start to glow.

Step 4: Combine Your Neon Pets

The final step is to combine your neon pets to create your epic neon mega pet. This can be done by purchasing a mega neon pet potion from the in-game store or by trading for one. Once you have the potion, simply use it on your neon pets to combine them into one glowing, magnificent creature.

In conclusion, creating an epic neon mega pet in Adopt Me is a process that takes time, dedication, and a bit of trading savvy. But with the right pets and a little patience, you too can create a pet that will have all your friends begging for your secrets. Follow these steps, and watch as your new pet becomes the envy of the game. Happy creating!

While playing Adopt me you will see many players roam with their Neon pets and might want to make one for yourself. And if that is the case then you are partially in luck because the process to make Neon pets is fairly easy. But while the process is easy it is also very tedious and requires a lot of grinding. So in this guide let us check how to get a neon Pet in Adopt Me and how to make a Mega Neon Pet.
 
## How to Make a Neon Pet in Adopt Me
 

 
You can make Neon pets by fusing four of your full-grown pets at the Neon Cave. Here is what you have to do:
 
- Get four pets and start growing them. These 4 pets should be of the same type, otherwise, this method won’t work.
 - There are seven stages of leveling up your pet starting from newborn all the way to full-grown.
 - Once you have all four of them fully grown take them to the Neon Cave.
 - You can find the door to the Neon Cave under the big white bridge. Check the image for reference.
 - Once you enter the cave you will find four spots for your four fully grown pets.
 - Place one on each spot.
 - This will merge the four pets and you will get a neon pet.

 
- You can find the door to the Neon Cave under the big white bridge. Check the image for reference.

 
Warning though, once you merge your pets you cannot revert the changes. The four pets will be gone in exchange for your new neon pet. Also, the neon pet you get will be a newborn so you will not only lose 4 pets but also their progression. Thus if you still want to continue then feel free to merge them.
 
### How to Get a Mega Neon Pet
 
The process to get a Mega Neon Pet is exactly the same as when you make a Neon Pet. You need to fully grow 4 Neon Pets and merge them. Here is what you have to do for it:
 
- Fully grow four neon pets of the same type.
 - Place them on the four spots in the Neon Cave.
 - They will fuse and you will get the Mega Neon Pet.
