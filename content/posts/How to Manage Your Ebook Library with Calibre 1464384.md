Calibre usually gets this right, but sometimes the metadata isn’t quite right when a book is imported. Easily edit this by selecting the “Edit metadata” option.

This information is displayed next to the “Start/Stop Content Server” button. For example, if your IP address is 127.0.0.1 and your port number “8080,” then you can access the content server by typing
