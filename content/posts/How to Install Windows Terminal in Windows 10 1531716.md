Windows Terminal is Microsoft’s powerful integration of several software, including the Command Prompt, Windows PowerShell, Azure Cloud Shell, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Using this latest console, you can easily multitask by switching between panes, running different types of commands side by side, and having a singular view of your entire system.
 
This tutorial covers different ways to install Windows Terminal on Windows 10 machines. The new Windows Terminal also allows you to experiment with different themes which we cover toward the end.
 
## About Windows Terminal 
 
Windows Terminal was first launched in May 2019 with a stated aim to run a multi-tabbed console that could run the PowerShell and Command line simultaneously on each side. The new Windows terminal also supports Azure Cloud Shell, SSH, and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). 
 
The console offers a genuine, multi-tabbed browsing experience. You can use Alt + Click to split a current window into two or more panes. Another shortcut, Shift + Click, opens a new terminal window. 
 
From the top menu selection, you can choose between Windows PowerShell, Command Prompt, and Azure Cloud Shell window panes. While the default is PowerShell, you can change it to Command Prompt from Settings.
 
## Ways to Install Windows Terminal
 
There are different ways to install Windows Terminal on your Windows 10 system, from the easy to the slightly more complex. Knowing these different strategies is important, as it would help you correctly install the latest versions and achieve more customization with additional themes and third-party software support.
 
### 1. From Microsoft Store
 
Of course, the easiest way to install the integrated Windows Terminal is to download it from Microsoft Store. The download link can be found here. 
 
In case your Store is not working properly, you can troubleshoot with these tips. 
 
Once the software is installed, you can readily launch it from the Store itself. 
 
You can always go back to the Windows search box to open the Windows Terminal app and even choose its default console window. Run it in “Administrator” mode for best results.
 
### 2. Through GitHub
 
The various release builds for Microsoft Windows Terminal can also be manually downloaded. The GitHub Releases link is here. Search for the latest Windows Terminal version under “Assets” as shown here. Click the “msixbundle” link to proceed.
 
The “msixbundle” package is quickly downloaded and saved on your system.
 
When you click to install, you will receive a preview of the Windows Terminal. This would proceed smoothly from here. 
 
It takes just a few minutes for the package to be completely installed. You are now ready to deploy Windows Terminal.
 
Once opened, you will notice a “do you want to close all tabs?” option after you close the terminal window. This would never happen with individual Command Prompt or PowerShell windows.
 
### 3. Through Chocolatey 
 
Chocolatey is one of the most versatile tools to install any third-party software. It can be used to make Discord bots, launch Power Toys, and provide a component of lightweight browsers.
 
Whether or not Chocolatey is installed on your system, you can always find out using a fresh set of instructions in Windows PowerShell. Copy the following into a PowerShell window and click “Enter:” 
 
As shown here, Chocolatey was already installed, so it just got upgraded. To install Windows Terminal using Chocolatey, the following command will do:
 
Click “Y” to any requests for “Yes to all.”
 
You will be able to view the success screen once the latest Windows Terminal package is launched through Chocolatey. 
 
## Windows Terminal Themes
 
Unlike the monotonous background of Windows Command Prompt and PowerShell, the new integrated Windows Terminal offers many colorful themes. 
 
While GitHub offers many different themes for Windows Terminal, you can find a huge selection of such themes from this online link. Go down to download a JSON file which has a collection of the themes. 
 
Go to the “Settings” menu in the integrated terminal window. Select “Open JSON file.”
 
Now open the Windows Terminal JSON themes from the downloaded location. This will give you more choice in colorful backgrounds.
 
You can also manually change the background and foreground (font color) from “Color Schemes” in Settings. 
 
Here we have learned different ways to install the Windows Terminal on Windows 10, along with adding new themes. Installing the new Windows Terminal does not affect your existing Command Prompt or PowerShell software. You can continue to use them while learning to use the integrated terminal. 
 
Moreover, it does not require too much learning, as the basic usage of PowerShell/Command Prompt has been retained. In fact, it’s been made easier. For example, you can freely copy-paste in the new Windows Terminal window for the Command Prompt and don’t have to separately configure it.
