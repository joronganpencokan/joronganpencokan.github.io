Android 12 Beta 1: The Revolutionary Update You Can't Afford to Miss!

Android has been dominating the mobile operating system industry ever since its inception in 2008. With every new update, it promises to deliver cutting-edge innovations and advancements in technology, making our smartphones smarter and more efficient. And its latest offering, Android 12 Beta 1, is no different!

Let's delve into the key features of this revolutionary update:

1. Material You Design – Android 12 brings a significant redesign to the operating system, and the Material You design language is one of its biggest highlights. It allows users to customize their interface by selecting personalized color schemes, font styles, and even the shape of icons. This feature is a game-changer as you can now tailor your interface to your preferences, giving it a more personal touch.

2. Enhanced Privacy Features – We are all concerned about our privacy, and Android 12 Beta 1 recognizes just that. It introduces several new privacy features such as the ability to see and control which apps have access to your microphone, camera, and location. It also includes a privacy dashboard that lets you see how apps are using your data and permission settings.

3. One-handed mode – With the growing trend of increasingly larger smartphone displays, it becomes challenging to use them with one hand. Android 12 solves this problem by introducing the "one-handed mode." It allows you to easily shift the screen to one side of the device, making it more accessible to use with one hand.

4. Game Mode – Android 12 Beta 1 also caters to the gaming community with its new game mode feature. It optimizes your phone for gaming by enhancing its performance and prioritizing battery life. Additionally, it enables seamless integration with video game streaming platforms, offering users a more comprehensive gaming experience.

5. Smarter Notifications – Notifications are an essential feature in our smartphones, and Android 12 aims to make them more manageable with its smart grouping feature. It not only categorizes notifications based on their source, but it also allows you to prioritize them according to your preferences, ensuring that you never miss an important update.

In conclusion, Android 12 Beta 1 is a revolutionary update that promises to enhance your smartphone experience greatly. From its Material You design language to its privacy and gaming features, this update offers something for everyone. So be sure to update your device and start exploring all the fantastic new features!

The first public beta for Android 12 doesn’t show much of the big changes that are coming to the OS, but it is a good start.

 
### 
Key Takeaways
 
- Android 12 beta 1 is now available to users with Pixel phones, as well as select other Android phones.While the first beta for Android 12 gives us a small look at the upcoming OS, there are still a lot of missing features that Google has yet to add.If you just want to see the big feature additions, like Material You’s new themer system, it isn’t worth downloading the Android 12 beta on your phone right now.

 

Announced at Google I/O 2021, Android 12’s first beta is now live, giving users with specific phones a taste of the changes coming with the new operating system. Between the Material You changes—which include the ability to set your phone’s system colors based on your wallpaper—and the new privacy features, Android 12 is a pretty radical shift from Android 11.

 

I’ve been using the beta for the past few days, and despite not offering the full suite of updates, Android 12 already is starting to look as good as Google wants you to think it will be.

 
##   Pretty and Bubbly  
 

While the first Android 12 beta isn’t giving us the full addition of Material You and its automatic themer—which can customize system and widget colors based on your wallpaper—there are some notable user interface changes.

 

First, the notifications shade and quick settings have been updated with the big and bubbly buttons showcased in Google’s preview of Android 12. New screen on and off animations are also present, alongside a slew of smaller animations that add playfulness to interacting with different buttons and options in the menus.

 
While Android 12 is extremely promising, the first beta still leaves us in the dark quite a bit.
 

Finally, the pin entry screen no longer shows the wallpaper, instead, blocking out the entirety of the phone’s display.

 

The theming system is still the same seen in Android 11, and none of the new widgets are available just yet, but it is nice to at least get a glimpse at what Material You’s new design is bringing to the user interface.

 

It is worth noting, though, that the UI changes mean there is less information density, which some may find annoying. Of course, this is just Google’s design, and other manufacturers could utilize Material You differently.

 
##   Privacy Soon  
 

While the visual redesign for Android 12 is huge, there are also some much bigger features coming with the new OS in the form of privacy settings. 

 

"One of the biggest (and most overdue) features of the Android 12 update relates to privacy," Rex Freiberger, a tech expert and CEO of GadgetReview, wrote in an email. 

 

"Prior to this, apps had to choose to let you know if they were using your microphone or camera and only had to ask permission initially when you installed them. Now, the OS, itself, will alert you when an app is trying to use your microphone or camera so you can decide whether or not you still want to use that app."

 

That particular setting isn’t available in Android 12 beta 1, but Google does have plans to add a slew of customizable privacy features in future updates. Android 12 is planned for release at some point later in the year, so it’s possible we could start to see more of these settings as soon as the next beta. Unfortunately, there’s no real way to tell what Google will add in the next update.

 
##   Shaping Up  
 

While Android 12 looks extremely promising, the first beta still leaves us quite a bit in the dark. We know that the changes coming to the OS are going to be big—those privacy settings alone are a pivotal push in the right direction—but there just isn’t enough to show off right now.

 

Still mostly missing is Material You, which is easily one of the most anticipated parts of the new operating system.

 
Now, the OS itself will alert you when an app is trying to use your microphone or camera so you can decide whether or not you still want to use that app.
 

If you’re someone that just feels like they have to have the latest update, then it might be worth downloading the beta and checking it out yourself. Just don’t expect it to look that much different from Android 11.

 

If you’re just in it to see the new Material You design and glimpse some of the other big features coming with Android 12, it’s worth waiting until Google adds more to the beta.
