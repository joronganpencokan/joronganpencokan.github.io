# Never Be Late Again: Unlock the Secret to Speedy Windows 8 Startups with this Easy Application Hack! 

Are you tired of waiting for your Windows 8 operating system to boot up every morning? Does the slow startup process make you late for work or school? If so, you're not alone. Many users experience slow startup times with their Windows 8 machines. Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem: an easy application hack.

This application hack involves changing the Windows 8 startup settings by disabling unnecessary programs and services that load at startup. By doing this, you can drastically reduce the time it takes for your operating system to start up. Here's how you can do it:

Step 1: Access the System Configuration Utility

The easiest way to access the System Configuration Utility is to press the Windows key and the R key at the same time, then type "msconfig" into the Run box and hit enter. This will bring up the System Configuration Utility.

Step 2: Navigate to the Startup tab

Once you've opened the System Configuration Utility, navigate to the Startup tab. Here, you'll see a list of all the programs and services that load at startup.

Step 3: Disable unnecessary programs and services

To speed up your Windows 8 startup, you'll want to disable any unnecessary programs and services that load at startup. Take a look at the list and uncheck any programs that you don't need to start up automatically. For example, you may have an antivirus program or Adobe Reader that you don't need to start up automatically every time you turn on your computer. Uncheck those boxes to prevent them from loading at startup.

Step 4: Apply and save changes

Once you've unchecked the programs and services you don't need, click on Apply and then OK to save your changes. You may be asked to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

And that's it! By disabling unnecessary programs and services at startup, you can significantly reduce the time it takes for Windows 8 to boot up. This easy application hack can save you time and frustration, and ensure that you're never late again. Give it a try and see how it works for you!

In most situations, we want to have as little apps running during startup as possible, so the whole boot up process will be quick and fast. We have shown you plenty of ways to remove/disable items from the startup list, but what if you want to do it the other way – force a particular app to run during startup? Most applications don’t have startup parameters that you can configure in settings, meaning that you’ll have to manually add them. Today, I’ll teach you how to do this in Windows 8.

 
## A Word Of Warning
 
If you didn’t already know, there are some negative aspects to making applications run at startup on Windows. First of all, the app could initiate before its dependencies are loaded and throw an error. This doesn’t happen very frequently, but you should be aware that nothing is wrong with the program. It’s just starting up before its libraries do. I must be honest – this might not happen at all in Windows 8, as I have never experienced such an issue, but the possibility is still there, and you should be aware of what caused it.
 
Also, making applications run at startup in Windows will prolong the amount of time the computer takes to finish booting. To test how much time an application will take to load up, try opening it with the computer already started. That’s half the time it would take to open at startup. The reason one particular app (such as Skype) would take so long to open during startup is because apps aren’t opened sequentially during the boot process. Rather, they are opened simultaneously, meaning that all of them will be loading up their libraries and components at the same time.
 
## The Tutorial
 
We’ll follow the steps sequentially through a Windows 8 machine in its default configuration:
 
1. Make a shortcut on the desktop to the application you want to run at startup.
 
2. Open Windows Explorer and type or paste the following in the address bar: 
 
Press “Enter” on the keyboard once you’ve copied and pasted it. This takes you to the directory holding every program that starts when Windows boots.
 

 
3. Drag the shortcut from the desktop to the startup folder you just opened.
 
You might see a couple of app shortcuts already placed in that startup folder. If you’d like to remove any of them, this is your chance to do it. Simply delete the shortcut and, under normal circumstances, that application will no longer start when your computer boots. Dropbox and other applications have a tendency to configure themselves this way during installation, sometimes against your best wishes.
