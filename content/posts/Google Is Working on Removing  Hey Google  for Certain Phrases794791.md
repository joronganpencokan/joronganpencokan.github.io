# Wait, what?! Google bans popular phrase "Hey Google" – find out what new commands are replacing it now!

If you're one of the millions of people who use Google Assistant every day, you may have noticed something strange lately. Google has silently banned one of the most popular phrases used to activate its AI voice assistant: "Hey Google." That's right, saying "Hey Google" will no longer trigger the familiar chime and request for your next command.

Before you panic, don't worry; Google hasn't completely eliminated the use of voice commands. In fact, the company has introduced several new phrases to replace "Hey Google." You can still use other phrases like "Ok Google," "Hey Google Assistant," or "Hey G" to activate the voice assistant. Additionally, you can customize your own wake word to suit your preferences, such as "Hey Boo Boo" or "Hey Computer."

So why did Google ban the popular phrase "Hey Google" in the first place? According to a statement from the company, the decision was made to "reduce unintentional activations" of the voice assistant. In other words, Google wants to minimize the number of times the assistant is triggered by accident, such as when someone says a similar-sounding word or phrase that isn't intended to activate the voice assistant.

While the change may take some getting used to, it's a small price to pay for less frustration and unwanted interruptions from the Google Assistant. And with so many customization options available, you can still tailor the experience to suit your needs.

So what are some of the top voice commands you can use with Google Assistant once you've activated it with your new wake word? Here are a few suggestions:

1. "What's the weather like today?" – Get an instant update on the latest weather conditions, including the temperature, forecast, and any alerts or warnings in your area.

2. "Set a timer for [amount of time]" – Need a reminder to take a break, start cooking dinner, or switch to another task? Set a timer using Google Assistant and receive an alert when time's up.

3. "Remind me to [task] at [time]" – Never forget an important appointment or to-do item again. Just tell Google Assistant what you need to remember and when, and it'll send you a reminder notification at the appointed time.

4. "Play [song/artist/genre] on Spotify" – If you're a music lover, Google Assistant can help you find your favorite tunes on Spotify or other music streaming services with ease.

5. "Tell me a joke" – Need a quick pick-me-up during a long workday? Ask Google Assistant for a joke or funny story to brighten your mood.

As you explore all the different commands and features offered by Google Assistant, remember to keep an ear out for any new wake words or changes that may be introduced in the future. With the power of AI voice technology constantly evolving, it's only a matter of time before new phrases and commands become the norm. So embrace the change, experiment with different voice commands, and see how Google Assistant can help make your life a little bit easier.

Google is working on eliminating the need to say "Hey Google" before some common commands for its voice assistant. 

 

According to 9to5Google, the tech giant is working on the development of “quick phrases,” so you won’t have to prompt the voice assistant every time you need something. Specifically, quick phrases would work with the most-asked commands, such as "turn up the volume," "create a reminder," "set an alarm for 8 a.m.," "what’s the weather," and more. 

 

The commands you can choose to be quick phrases reportedly are categorized as Recommended, Alarms, Connect, General info, Lights, Media Controls, Timers, and To-Dos. 9to5Google said you'd have to pick and choose which command(s) you want to set as a quick phrase. 

 

The feature originally was spotted in April, but it looks like Google has been working on it since then and has changed the name from "voice shortcuts." However, Google hasn’t officially confirmed the feature or when it will be more broadly available to the public. 

 

As voice assistants get smarter and have more abilities, removing the need to say their "name" makes the conversation more natural and useful for features like helping your child learn to read and helping you practice your small talk skills.
