# Ready to Blow Out the Candles? Celebrate Make Tech Easier's Birthday with These Mind-Blowing Tech Tips!

As Make Tech Easier turns another year older, it's time to celebrate with some mind-blowing tech tips. From productivity hacks to innovative gadget suggestions, these tech tips will take your skills to the next level and improve your daily life.

## 1. Unleash Your Creativity with Design Thinking

Design thinking is a creative problem-solving approach that can help you tackle challenges and improve your life. Start by understanding your problem or need, brainstorming solutions, and iterating ideas until you find the best one. With design thinking, you can approach any problem by thinking creatively and breaking it down into actionable steps.

## 2. Take Control of Your Inbox with Email Filters

If your inbox is full of clutter, it's time to take control with email filters. These handy tools can help you sort and prioritize your email based on sender, subject, keywords, and more. You can create filters in Gmail, Outlook, and other email clients to automatically route emails to folders or apply labels based on rules you set up.

## 3. Boost Your Productivity with Time Management Apps

Time management apps are a great way to keep track of your schedule and stay on top of your tasks. From simple to-do lists to sophisticated project management tools, there are many options available to help you stay organized and focused. Try apps like Trello, Asana, or Todoist to streamline your workflow and maximize your productivity.

## 4. Stay Safe Online with VPNs

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are essential tools for protecting your privacy and security online. With a VPN, you can encrypt your internet traffic and hide your IP address, making it harder for hackers and snoops to spy on your online activity. VPNs also allow you to bypass geo-restrictions and access content that may be blocked in your location.

## 5. Connect Your Home with Smart Home Devices

Smart home devices are becoming increasingly popular, and for good reason. From voice assistants like Amazon Echo and Google Home to smart locks, lights, and thermostats, these devices can make your home more convenient and energy-efficient. You can even set up routines and schedules to automate tasks and save time.

## 6. Get Creative with 3D Printing

3D printing is a fun and creative way to make virtually anything you can imagine. Whether you want to print toys, tools, or even prosthetic limbs, there are 3D printing options available for every budget and skill level. You can even join online communities to share ideas, designs, and tips with other 3D printing enthusiasts.

## 7. Embrace the Future with Augmented Reality

Augmented Reality (AR) is an exciting technology that overlays digital information on the real world. From shopping and gaming to education and entertainment, AR can enhance many aspects of our daily lives. You can explore AR with apps like Pokemon Go, Ikea Place, and Snapchat, or invest in AR glasses like Magic Leap or Microsoft HoloLens for a more immersive experience.

## Conclusion

As Make Tech Easier celebrates another year of providing valuable tech tips and resources, take a moment to reflect on how these tips can improve your daily life. Whether you're looking to boost your productivity, protect your privacy, or get creative, these tech tips can help you unleash your full potential and make the most of the digital world. Cheers to another year of innovation and progress!

It has been a long five year and I am glad we are still around. 
 
It all started back in Nov 2007 when I wanted to have a personal space to document all my tech knowledge. I am tired of bookmarking a tons of tutorial sites and return to find that they are no longer around. I reckon that the only way to have these tutorials at my fingertips is to keep them on my own blog so I can refer to them anytime I want. I also try to write these tutorials in an easy-to-understand and easy-to-follow manner so I won’t be confused by my own writing in the future. That is when I coined the term “make tech easier”, or at least making it easier for me. 
 
The year 2007 is also the year I started to use Ubuntu on a full scale. I started playing with Ubuntu Dapper 6.06 and completely replaced my Windows XP with Ubuntu when 7.04 was released. Back then, the command line is almost the way to survive (on Linux) and Linux tutorials were few and sparse. That also explains why plenty of our Linux articles were an instant hit and they helped push the traffic to beyond my imagination. By June 2008, we were already having a consistent traffic count of 3000 – 5000 visitors per day, despite that only one article was published per day, excluding the weekend. With the increased traffic and income, that is when I started to realize that I could go full-time on this. 
 
Five years down the road, we are now a multi-writers team and have transitioned from just a Linux blog to include Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and more. We have published over 3000 tutorials, tips and tricks and will continue to do so for many years to come. 
 
For those who have followed us throughout the whole journey or along the way, thank you very much. Without all of you, we won’t be what we are today. 
 
Lastly, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAKE TECH EASIER
 
## Welcome to our Birthday bash!
 
The fifth year is always a memorable year. In my country, people always hold a celebration for their 5th birthday, or in work, receives a medal for long service award. And yes, we will be holding a series of celebration, recognition and giveaways. You heard me right, we have giveaways for you, not 1 or 2, but 5 giveaways that we will hold throughout the week.
 
On top of all that, we also have a very special giveaway. Do check out the site again for more detail. I promise, it will be worth your while.
