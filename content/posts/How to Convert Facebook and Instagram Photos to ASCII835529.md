# Unlock the Secret Code: Convert Your Facebook and Instagram Photos to ASCII with One Simple Trick!

Are you looking for a unique way to display your photos on social media? Then, look no further than converting your Facebook and Instagram photos into ASCII code.

ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It is a coding standard that assigns each letter, digit, and symbol on the keyboard a unique numerical value. By converting your photos into ASCII code, you transform them into a series of characters that create a mosaic-like representation of your original photo.

Luckily, converting your photos to ASCII code is easier than you might think. With the right tools, you can have your pictures transformed in just a few clicks!

## Step 1: Choose Your Photo

The first step is to choose the photo you want to convert. Whether it’s a stunning landscape, a pet photograph or a portrait, any photo can be transformed into ASCII art.

## Step 2: Choose an Online Converter

To convert your photo to ASCII, you’ll need to use an online converter. There are plenty of free converters available online. Simply search for “ASCII photo converter,” and you’ll find a variety of options to choose from.

## Step 3: Upload Your Photo and Convert it to ASCII

Most online converters have a simple interface. Simply upload your photo and choose the ASCII conversion option. Depending on the size and complexity of your photo, the conversion process may take a few moments.

## Step 4: Customize Your ASCII Art

Once your photo has been converted into ASCII code, you can customize your art by changing the characters used and the density of the characters. Most converters have options that allow you to invert the image, adjust the contrast, and change the character set to symbols, letters or digits.

## Step 5: Share Your ASCII Art on Facebook and Instagram

After customizing your ASCII art, it’s time to share it on social media. Simply upload your art to Facebook or Instagram as you would with any other photo. ASCII art is a unique way to display your photos, and your followers will be impressed by your creativity.

In conclusion, converting your Facebook and Instagram photos to ASCII code is a simple and fun way to create unique art.

If you have seen a photo either on Facebook or Instagram and would like to have its ASCII version, then look no further as both of these websites do have the feature that lets you convert any public photo to ASCII right in your browser.
 
All you need to do is launch the photo in your browser and add some modifications in the URL, and you are all set to get the ASCII version of your photo.
 
Here’s the entire procedure to do so for both Facebook and Instagram.
 
## Convert Facebook Photos to ASCII
 
This should only work for the photos that have their privacy set as Public. It will not work for photos that are hidden from Public.
 
1. Head over to Facebook and find a photo that is publicly viewable. This means you cannot use the photos that are set to only be viewed by yourself, friends, or friends of friends.
 
2. When the photo loads, right-click anywhere on the photo and select the option that says “Open Image in New Tab.” The photo will then load without the interference of Facebook features.
 

 
3. When the photo launches in a new tab, look in the address bar of your browser, and you should see the full path to the photo on Facebook. The path should end with the format of the photo (.jpg, .png, etc.).
 
What you need to do is add “.html” (without quotes) at the end of the URL and press Enter. It will instantly convert the photo to ASCII characters.
 
4. You should be able to see the converted photo in your web browser tab. You can now copy these ASCII characters laid out as the given photo anywhere on your computer. Press “Command + S” for Mac or “Ctrl + S” for Windows to save the ASCII photo to your computer.
 
While it was easy to convert Facebook photos to ASCII, converting Instagram photos to ASCII is not that easy because you cannot get the direct URL of a photo easily.
 
## Convert Instagram Photos to ASCII
 
1. Head to Instagram using any of the browsers on your computer, and click on the photo that you want to convert to ASCII. Make sure you click on the photo so that you are taken to the photo page and not the Instagram profile where you found the photo. Again, the photo has to be set as viewable to the public or you cannot do the task.
 
2. Once you are on the chosen photo page, add “media” at the end of the URL in the address bar to go to the direct link for the photo.
 
The URL to my photo is  “https://www.instagram.com/p/vvPs4bMUjh/.”
 
After adding “media” it will look like “https://www.instagram.com/p/vvPs4bMUjh/media.”
 
3. Now that you are on the direct page of the photo, click on the address bar in your browser and add “.html” after the photo format as shown below.
 
4. Your photo will be converted to ASCII, and you can save it to your computer for other uses.
 
## Conclusion
 
If you wish to convert a photo on Facebook or Instagram to ASCII, then you can use the built-in features on those sites to do the job without running to third-party tools.
