You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Beat Hollow Knight's Hornet With This Boss Guide!

Hollow Knight, a critically acclaimed game known for challenging gameplay, is known for its difficult bosses such as Hornet. She is known for her agility and speed, which can catch players off guard. However, with a bit of preparation and the right strategy, she can be beaten with ease.

Here are some tips to help you beat Hornet:

1. Learn Her Patterns

Hornet has predictable attack patterns, which means you can easily dodge her attacks once you know them. She starts with a lunging attack that you can avoid by jumping or dashing aside. After that, she tends to leap and swing her needle at the player. You can avoid it by dashing under her. Focus on studying her moves to find the perfect time to attack.

2. Use Your Spells

One of the best ways to deal damage to Hornet is by using spells. Equip the Vengeful Spirit or Shade Soul, and use them when Hornet lands. They deal a significant amount of damage, and you can even use them to interrupt her attacks.

3. Use Charms

Charms play an important role in your fight against Hornet. Equipping the right charms can give you an advantage in combat. For example, equip the Quick Focus Charm to restore health faster, making it easier to sustain yourself while avoiding her attacks. You can also equip the Mark of Pride Charm to increase your range and deal more damage to her.

4. Stay Mobile

Hornet is fast, and she moves around a lot in combat. You need to be able to move quickly to avoid her attacks and stay close enough to land your own. Use your dash ability to avoid her attacks and get close to her quickly. You can also use your wall jump ability to jump over her attacks and move around the arena.

5. Timing is Key

Finally, timing is everything when it comes to beating Hornet. Wait for the right moment to attack her. Don't be too aggressive or you'll leave yourself open to her attacks. Always observe her moves and wait for the perfect timing to strike.

In conclusion, beating Hollow Knight's Hornet may seem daunting, but with the right strategy and preparation, you'll find her quite easy to defeat. Just remember to study her patterns, use your spells and charms, stay mobile and keep your timing precise. With these tips, you'll be able to take down Hornet in no time!

Hollow Knight is a 2D Side-scrolling Metroidvania video game by Team Cherry. The video game features souls-like gameplay that revolves around the dark world of Hallownest. As you progress, you will face several enemies and creatures to defeat. Hornet is one of the characters that you will encounter twice. In these two encounters, she will fight against you to test your combat skills. While there are not many differences in her moves in these both fights, it can be slightly tricky to defeat her. So, here’s our guide on how to beat Hornet in Hollow Knight.
 
## How to Beat Hornet in Hollow Knight
 
As mentioned, you will face Hornet twice. Firstly, you will face her at the west of the Greenpath near Stag Station. Here are some of the moves she will use against you:
 
### Dashing Needle Attack
 
This attack will be used by her for most of the fight. When Hornet inflicts this attack, she will unleash her needle in a linear path. You can dodge this attack by jumping until the needle’s back with her. If you time it right, you can attack her from above until the needle returns to her. But you need to be quick or else you will get hit by this attack.
 
### Hovering Silk AoE Attack
 
When Hornet inflicts this attack, they will get a higher ground above and unleash some strings of Silk. Now, the tricky part about this attack is that she can inflict it also on the ground. If you get closer to these strings, your health will deplete eventually. So, the best way to dodge this attack will be to stay back from the range.
 
### Flying Needle Attack
 
During this attack, she will fly and pierce a needle down to you. This can be at any level which makes it difficult to dodge. She can either attack you on the ground or fly to pierce the needle down. But as the attack comes in a linear path, you can dodge it by getting out of her way. As she lands the attack, you can attack her from behind to damage her. Once you deplete her enough health, she will be stunned for a while. This will be the best time to inflict damage and defeat her.
 
### Second Boss Fight with Hornet
 
The only key differences in encountering her for the second time are her increased speed and reduced stunning time. In addition to that, she can also throw spiked balls in your way.
 
So, make sure to jump and dodge her attacks. Or you can also counterattack with your nail.
 
Make sure to upgrade your equipment and heal enough during the fight. You need to be patient and analyze her attacks. Once you analyze her attack patterns, it will be easier to dodge them.
