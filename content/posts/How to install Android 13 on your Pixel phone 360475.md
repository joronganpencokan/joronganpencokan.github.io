Google is now rolling out Android 13 for compatible devices. In this release, the company is not redefining the way you use your phone, but in version 13, you will find a number of visual changes, improvements, and various new features that are worth the upgrade.
 
For example, on Android 13, you will find an updated version of “Material You” with new styles and colors, a cloud-powered clipboard that syncs content across devices, complete encryption for group conversations, better control for app notifications, and other tweaks and fixes.
 
The 13th version of Android will be first available for Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 6A, Pixel 6, Pixel 5A, Pixel 5, Pixel 4A (5G), Pixel 4A, Pixel 4  XL, and Pixel 4. Then other manufacturers will follow their rollout to its compatible phones, including Samsung Galaxy, OnePluse, Oppo, Sony, Xiaomi, and others.
 
This guide will teach you the easy steps to upgrade from Android 12 to 13. However, if you have one of the Pixel 6 variants, the company points out that once the phone is upgraded, you won’t be able to roll back to the previous version.
 
- Install Android 13 on a Pixel 6, 5, 4
 - Install Android 13 on a Pixel using Beta program

 
## Install Android 13 on a Pixel 6 , 5, 4
 
To install Android 13 on a Pixel 6 Pro, 6, 5, or 4, use these steps:
 
- Open Settings on Android.
 - Tap on System.
 - Tap on System update.
 - Tap the Check for update button.
 - Tap the Download and install button.

 
Once you complete the steps, the installation files will download, and the system will apply the Android 13 update. The installation process should take less than an hour to complete, but the time will depend on the hardware available on your phone.
 
Open Settings on Android.
 
Tap on System.
 
Tap on System update.
 
Tap the Check for update button.
 

 
Tap the Download and install button.
 
Google is gradually rolling out the update, which means that not everyone will see Android 13 on day one. You will need to check later if the update is unavailable on your phone.
 
## Install Android 13 on a Pixel using Beta program
 
If you don’t want to wait, you can force the Android 13 installation using the Android Beta program. Google’s Android Beta program has been designed to test development previews of upcoming releases of Android. However, since the final version of Android 13 has been released, if you enroll your compatible device today, you will receive version 13.
 
To install Android 13 through the Beta program, use these steps:
 
- Open Android Beta program website.
 - Sign in with your Google account (if applicable).
 - Under the “Your eligible devices” section, click the Opt in button.
 - Click the Confirm and Enroll button.
 - Open Settings on your Pixel phone.
 - Tap on System.
 - Tap on System update.
 - Tap the Check for update button.
 - Tap the Download and install button to install Android 13.
 - Open Android Beta program website after the upgrade.
 - Sign in with your Google account (if applicable).
 - Under the “Your eligible devices” section, click the Opt out button to unenroll the phone

 
After you complete the steps, the Pixel phone will upgrade to Android 13 with the same version Google is rolling out to other devices.
 
Open Android Beta program website.
 
Sign in with your Google account (if applicable).
 
Under the “Your eligible devices” section, click the Opt in button.
 
Click the Confirm and Enroll button.
 
Open Settings on your Pixel phone.
 
Tap the Download and install button to install Android 13.
 
Open Android Beta program website after the upgrade.
 
Under the “Your eligible devices” section, click the Opt out button to unenroll the phone
 
When opting out of the Beta program, you may receive a message that leaving the program will trigger an update that will delete the data and reset the device to a stable build. However, since Android 13 is a stable build, this action will not take place. 
 
This option only works during the early days of the rollout. Once Google begins testing new builds of the next version of Android, you won’t be able to upgrade using the above instructions, and your phone will receive the update that will wipe out the data and reset the phone to the stable build. The window to upgrade is expected to be open until September.
 
Alternatively, it’s possible to sideload Android 13 on a Pixel. For this approach, you will need to download the installation image, start the phone in recovery mode, use the “adb” tool to apply the new version, and then restart the phone.
