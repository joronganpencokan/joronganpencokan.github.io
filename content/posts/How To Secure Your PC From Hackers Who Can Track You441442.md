Are you leaving yourself vulnerable to hackers?! Learn these essential tips to protect your PC and stay anonymous online!

In the digital age, we have become highly dependent on our computers and the Internet. While technology has made our lives more comfortable, it has also made us vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Hackers are constantly trying to steal private data from unsuspecting users, such as credit card details, passwords, and personal information. Therefore, it is essential to take steps to protect your PC and stay anonymous online. Here are some tips to get you started:

1. Use a strong password: Your password is the entry point to your device, data, and personal information. Therefore, it is essential to use a strong and complex password that includes a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and is at least eight characters long. You should avoid using passwords that are easy to guess, such as your name, birthdate or other personal information.

2. Keep your software updated: Developers release updates to their software to fix security bugs and other issues. Therefore, it is essential to keep your operating system, antivirus, and other software updated to ensure that you have the latest security patches.

3. Use antivirus software: Antivirus software is essential for protecting your computer from viruses, malware, and other malicious software. Therefore, it is necessary to install antivirus software on your PC, and ensure that you keep the software updated.

4. Use a VPN: A VPN or Virtual Private Network is a secure tunnel between your computer and the Internet. It prevents hackers and other cybercriminals from intercepting your data or tracking your online activity. Therefore, it is essential to use a VPN to encrypt your data and stay anonymous online.

5. Be aware of phishing scams: Phishing is a type of cyber-attack where cybercriminals use fake websites, emails, or messages to trick you into providing personal information, such as passwords or credit card details. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of phishing scams and avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing personal information to unknown websites.

In conclusion, protecting your PC and staying anonymous online requires a vigilant approach towards online safety. By using a strong password, updating your software, using antivirus software, using a VPN, and being aware of phishing scams, you can significantly reduce the risk of cyber-attacks and protect your personal data. Remember, prevention is always better than cure, and taking these essential measures can go a long way towards keeping you safe online.

## Secure Your PC From Hackers Who Can Track You


When it comes to security, it’s always better to arm yourself beforehand rather than waiting to get infected. So, in this article, we are going to share a few things that could help you secure your PC from hackers.
Choose An OS Based On Its Security
If you have just purchased a new computer or laptop and want to remain on the safe side, then you need to choose an operating system based on its security. Microsoft Windows Operating system is right now used by millions of users, but it’s definitely not the secure OS out there. That’s why the Windows operating system receives frequent updates compared to other OS. Linux and OpenBSD is definitely the best operating system if security is the utmost privacy.

 
### Choose Web Browser


Well, most of us prefer Google Chrome over any other web browser. However, to secure your computer, you need to choose a web browser based on its security and vulnerabilities because malware or viruses mostly enters your system through the web browser. Even if you are using the Google Chrome web browser, then make sure to use Adblocker and script blocker to be on the safe side. These extensions will make things difficult for hackers to compromise the system.

 
### Keep Your System Updated


Windows update can often seem like an annoyance, but its really important to install them. Windows updates not only add extra features, but they also come with lots of bug and security fixes. So, it’s always best to update the operating system. Also, the latest builds of Windows 10 has a better Windows defender that got ransomware protection, tamper protection, etc.

 
### Using Windows Event Viewer


This is one of the best methods that will tell you about the activities going on your computer. Windows Event Viewer will let you know about any unusual activities or suspicious events.
Step 1. Open the Windows 10 search box, type ‘eventvwr.msc’ and press Enter.

### Bad browser extensions


Well, browser extensions never fail to please users. But, these extensions can monitor your online activities, steal your data, and can do much more than that. Using extensions is not bad, but you need to double-check what you are installing. Moreover, you also need to check the permissions of installed extensions.

 
### Enable a firewall


Firewalls play a key role in protecting your computer against hackers. The firewall acts as a barrier between your computer and the internet. The role of the Firewall is to block the computer ports that prevent communication with your connected device. The firewall can protect your computer by blocking threats from entering the system and spreading between the devices.

 
### Use a Different Network


When someone is monitoring your computer, it is dependent on the network which we are connected to. Let us take an example as someone has installed a keylogger program. This program transfers the data from one machine to another, but on the same network. In these cases, you can try using a different network. This will not ensure that you are not being monitored in all the cases, but it will do help prevent some types of monitoring depending on how the person sets up all.

 
### Unplug or Disconnect


If you don’t have any option to do, just disconnect or unplug your computer from the network. This will ensure that no one will monitor your system. Basically, it’s good to unplug and follow other methods if you are confirmed that you have been tracked.

 
### Encrypting Keys To Protect From Keyloggers


Keyloggers are dangerous as they can record your keystrokes, track your activity, and can record the open sites. With Keyloggers, your accounts can be easily hacked by the hackers. These keyloggers can detect your bank accounts passwords too. So better it to avoid them as much you can. So follow the guide to encrypt keyboard.

 
### Using Malwarebytes


Malwarebytes detects and removes malware in real-time with advanced anti-malware, anti-spyware, and anti-rootkit technology. The good thing about Malwarebytes is that it scans for the newest and most dangerous threats automatically, so you’re protected without having to even think about it.

 
### Use AdwCleaner


Well, AdwCleaner is definitely underrated, but it can remove stubborn and hidden malware from your computer. It requires less than 30 MB of storage to install on your computer and it can remove adware, PUPs from your computer. However, AdwCleaner is not an antivirus tool, so, you need to use an additional security tool with AdwCleaner. However, still, AdwCleaner is recommended by lots of security experts from all around the world.
