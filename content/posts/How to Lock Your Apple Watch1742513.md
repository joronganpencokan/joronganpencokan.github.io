#Unlock the Secret to Keeping Your Apple Watch Safe with These Simple Steps!

The Apple Watch is a must-have accessory for many tech-savvy individuals. With its sleek design and innovative features, it has become a key player in the wearables market. However, with its high price point, protecting the device can be a top priority for many users. In this article, we will discuss the secrets to keeping your Apple Watch safe with just a few simple steps.

#Step 1: Protect Your Screen

The Apple Watch is equipped with a durable screen made from Ion-X Glass for its standard model or Sapphire Crystal for the higher-end versions. That being said, accidents happen, and it’s best to keep your Apple Watch’s screen well-protected.

One way to protect your screen is by using a tempered glass screen protector. This thin layer of tempered glass can resist scratches, cracks, and minor impacts. This screen protector is a cost-effective solution that can save you from costly repairs in the long run.

#Step 2: Keep It Dry and Sweat-Free

Apple Watch is IP-rated against water and dust, but it is not entirely waterproof. Avoid wearing your Apple Watch while swimming or engaging in any water sport.

Moreover, when you sweat during a workout, make sure to clean the watch with a microfiber cloth to keep moisture from accumulating within the device. Any moisture that seeps into the watch can cause damage to the internal components.

#Step 3: Avoid Extreme Temperatures

Extreme temperatures can be harmful to your Apple Watch. Apple advises users to avoid exposing the watches to extreme temperatures below -10ºC or above 45ºC. The extreme temperature can damage your Apple Watch's battery, screen, and other internal components.

#Step 4: Be Careful When Charging

The Apple Watch needs to be charged regularly to function correctly. However, charging the watch can also pose a risk if not done properly. Avoid overcharging your device to prevent battery damage.

Moreover, use only Apple-approved chargers and avoid using third-party chargers. Using a third-party charger can cause damage to the battery, which can render your watch unusable.

#Step 5: Regular Maintenance

Lastly, when it comes to keeping your Apple Watch safe, it’s essential to take care of it regularly. Keep the watch clean and free from dust, dirt, and grime that can accumulate over time. Use a microfiber cloth to clean the device and avoid using harsh chemicals or solutions that may damage your watch’s screen or external finish.

In conclusion, keeping your Apple Watch safe can be straightforward and easy if you follow these simple steps. Protecting your screen, keeping it sweat-free, avoiding extreme temperatures, being careful when charging, and performing regular maintenance can go a long way in extending the lifespan of your Apple Watch. Remember, these simple steps can save you from costly repairs or replacements in the long run.

The Apple Watch is different from a lot of your everyday tech gear because it's one of the few things (in fact, likely the only device) you wear on your body. Locking it is less critical than on a device you might leave lying around, but it is still a good idea.

 
##   Locking Your Apple Watch  
 

Enabling the Wrist Detection feature is the best way to make sure your Apple Watch locks when you aren't looking at it. The original Apple Watch had a manual lock option, but if you're using watchOS 3.1.3 or later, the manual lock option is no longer available. Apple replaced it with the Wrist Detection feature.

 
Information in this article applies to Apple Watch with watchOS 6, watchOS 5, watchOS 4, and watchOS 3, except as indicated.
 

The other way to force the lock screen is to turn off your Apple Watch. You must enter your passcode when you turn it back on.

 
##   Turning on Wrist Detection  
 

Wrist Detection is handy and easy to activate.

 
- Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.
 - Tap Passcode.
 - Swipe the slider to turn on Wrist Detection.

 

You can also turn on Wrist Detection on the Apple Watch itself by tapping the Settings icon on the app screen, followed by Passcode. Move the slider next to Wrist Detection to On/green.

 

Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.

 

Tap Passcode.

 

Swipe the slider to turn on Wrist Detection.

 
##   Using Water Lock  
 

Apple Watch with watchOS 5 or later offer water protection. Water can activate your screen, so whether you're wearing your watch in the shower or going for a swim, the Water Lock feature is handy.

 

Selecting a water activity in the Workout app automatically turns on Water Lock. If you're not counting your shower as a workout, you need to turn it on in the Control Center.

 
- Swipe up on your watch to open the Control Center.
 - Tap Water Lock, which is the symbol with a single droplet shape, to activate the water lock feature.
 - To turn off Water Lock, turn the Digital Crown until your Apple Watch says it's unlocked.

 
##   Set a Passcode With a New Apple Watch  
 

One of the first things you are prompted to do when setting up a new Apple Watch is to create a passcode. You can bypass this step, but it's a quick way to protect your watch right out of the box.

 

Swipe up on your watch to open the Control Center.

 

Tap Water Lock, which is the symbol with a single droplet shape, to activate the water lock feature.

 

To turn off Water Lock, turn the Digital Crown until your Apple Watch says it's unlocked.

 
### 
Ejecting Water From Apple Watch
 
Water Lock isn't just for convenience. It also includes a feature used to push water out of the speaker holes in your Apple Watch to prevent any water from causing damage to your device.
 
- Select Create a Passcode. If you choose a code that might be easy to guess, such as repetitive digits, you are prompted to verify that you still want to use it.
 - As an alternate option, select Add a Long Passcode if you want to use more than four digits for a stronger passcode.
 - Reenter your passcode to confirm.

 
##   Adding a Passcode After Initial Pairing  
 

If you opted not to make a passcode when you initially paired your Apple Watch, you can do it later, either on the Apple Watch or on your iPhone using the Apple Watch app.

 

Select Create a Passcode. If you choose a code that might be easy to guess, such as repetitive digits, you are prompted to verify that you still want to use it.

 

As an alternate option, select Add a Long Passcode if you want to use more than four digits for a stronger passcode.

 

Reenter your passcode to confirm.

 
### 
Wrist Detection
 
Adding a passcode to your Apple Watch enables Wrist Detection automatically. When you take off your watch and it goes into sleep mode, your passcode is required to wake it up.
 
###   Adding a Passcode on Apple Watch  
 

You can add a passcode directly on the Apple Watch.

 
- Press the digital crown on the watch to open the app screen.
 - Tap the Settings icon.
 - Tap Passcode.
 - Move the slider next to Simple Passcode to On/green and enter a four-digit code in the field provided.

 

You cannot set a longer passcode on your Apple Watch directly. You have to use your iPhone to do that.

 

Press the digital crown on the watch to open the app screen.

 

Tap the Settings icon.

 

Move the slider next to Simple Passcode to On/green and enter a four-digit code in the field provided.

 
###   Adding an Apple Watch Passcode on iPhone  
 

You can also use your iPhone to turn on the passcode feature for your Apple Watch.

 
- Open the Apple Watch app on the iPhone and tap Passcode.
 - Select Turn Passcode On.
 - Enter your desired passcode.

 
###   Adding a Longer Passcode on iPhone  
 

If you created a four-digit code initially but want to have a more secure passcode, you can update it through your iPhone. Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and select Passcode. Use the toggle switch to turn off Simple Passcode and then the app directs you to your Apple Watch for the next steps.

 

Open the Apple Watch app on the iPhone and tap Passcode.

 

Select Turn Passcode On.

 

Enter your desired passcode.

 

Enter your current four-digit passcode on the watch. Then enter a new, longer option and tap OK. Reenter the code to verify it.

 

Now you're ready to keep your Apple Watch safe from prying eyes, curious toddlers, and potential water damage.

 
You can change an existing passcode through the Apple Watch by going to Settings > Passcode > Change Passcode. You can also change the passcode through the Apple Watch app on the iPhone.
