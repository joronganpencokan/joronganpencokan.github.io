# Unlock the Power of Wordpress: Learn How to Merge Categories Like a Pro!

If you own a WordPress website, you know that managing your content can be a bit tricky. One of the challenges is organizing your posts into the right categories. Over time, your website might accumulate a long list of categories. Some might even become obsolete or irrelevant. If you find yourself in this situation, don’t worry. WordPress provides a way to merge categories, allowing you to tidy up your website and make it easier to navigate.

In this article, we’ll show you how to merge categories like a pro. We’ll start with the basics and then dive into the finer details.

## What is a Category in WordPress?

A category is a way to group related content together. It’s like a folder that holds all the posts that are related to a particular topic. Categories help visitors to your website find the information they are looking for quickly and easily.

WordPress categories can be found in the Posts section of the Dashboard. You can create new categories and assign them to your posts by editing them.

## Why Merge Categories?

As your website grows, your list of categories might become too long or too convoluted. This can make it difficult for visitors to find the content they are looking for. You may also find that some of your categories are becoming obsolete, or that you have duplicated categories. Merging categories will help you to consolidate your content and make it more organized.

## How to Merge Categories

Merging categories is a straightforward process that can be done in a few steps.

1. Firstly, log in to your WordPress Dashboard.

2. Next, go to the Posts section.

3. Select Categories.

4. Find the two categories you want to merge.

5. Click on the checkbox next to each category.

6. From the Bulk Actions dropdown, select Merge.

7. Click on the Apply button.

8. Choose which category you want to keep.

9. Click the Merge button.

That’s it! Your two categories are now merged into one.

## Advanced Tips for Merging Categories

While merging categories is easy, there are a few things to keep in mind to ensure that you get the most out of the process.

### 1. Choose the Right Category Name

The name of the category you keep is critical. Make sure to choose a name that is descriptive and straightforward. The new category name should make sense to users and accurately reflect what the category is about.

### 2. Check for Duplicates

Before merging categories, it’s a good idea to check if there are any duplicates. For example, if you have categories called “recipes” and “cooking,” you might find that they contain the same content. In this case, you would want to merge the two categories to avoid confusion.

### 3. Update Your Posts

After merging categories, it’s a good idea to review your posts to make sure they are assigned to the correct category. You may need to update some posts to ensure that they are in the right category.

### 4. Use Plugins

WordPress plugins can help you to merge categories quickly and efficiently. You can use plugins like Batch Categories or WP Bulk Post Terms to merge categories in bulk.

## Conclusion

Merging categories is an easy and effective way to organize your WordPress website. By consolidating your content, you make it easier for visitors to find what they are looking for. Remember to choose the right category name, check for duplicates, and update your posts after merging categories. Use plugins to save time and automate the process. With these tips, you can merge categories like a pro and unlock the full potential of your WordPress website.

In our previous post on cleaning up tags in WordPress, some of you feedback that you are looking for ways to merge categories too. In this tutorial, I will show you how to merge categories in WordPress.
 
## Situation
 
When iPhone first launched, we created a category called “iPhone” for every article related to iPhone. Later when the iPad was released, we again created another category call “iPad”, since at that time, iPhone and iPad are two different devices. When Apple merged all its mobile OS into the current iOS, there seems to be very little differences between iPhone and iPad anymore. In this case, rather than maintaining two different categories of similar context, it is much more efficient to merge them together into one single category.

 
## The merging process
 
Here is what we need to do:
 
1. Move all the posts from one category to the other (the one you want to merge into).
2. Delete the duplicate category.
3. Add a URL forwarder to redirect the previous category URL to the new URL.
 
## The steps
 
1. In your WordPress dashboard, go to “Posts -> All Posts”. Filter all the posts with the category you want to delete.
 

 
2. Check out the number of posts in this particular category. 
 
At the top of the screen, click Screen Options and enter the number of posts to appear on the screen. 
 
3. Check every single post in this category. Click Edit.
 
4. Add the category that you want to merge into. 
 
5. Once done, go to “Posts -> Category”. Delete the category from the list.
 
6. Lastly, using a FTP application, download the .htaccess file (assuming you are using a Linux web host) from your server root. Open the .htaccess file with a text editor and addd the following line to the top of the file.
 
For example, the old category URL is at http://your-domain.com/category/old-category and the new category URL is http://your-domain.com/category/new-category. So in your .htaccess file, you will put:
 
redirect 301 /category/old-category http://your-domain.com/category/new-category
 
Save and upload (and replace) the .htacess file to your server.
 
That’s it. Alternatively, you can install the Redirection WordPress plugin to manage the redirection. This will, however, increase your server load. Using the .htaccess method is more straightforward, though it can be a little bit intimidating to the new users.
