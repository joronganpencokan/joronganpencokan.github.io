As the real estate industry continues to evolve, it takes the right kind of innovation to remain competitive. Hassan Riggs, the CEO and founder of Smart Alto, is providing a new way for real estate agents to succeed. With its state-of-the-art technology, his company is introducing groundbreaking solutions to help agents close more deals and earn more income. In this article, we will take a closer look at how Hassan Riggs and Smart Alto are revolutionizing the real estate industry.

Smart Alto is an innovative technology platform that provides real estate agents with virtual assistants to provide outstanding customer service. These assistants handle consumer inquiries and follow-up, ensuring that agents can focus on closing deals. Agents need not worry about being overwhelmed by email, text, and social media inquiries. Smart Alto takes care of everything and elevates customer service in the process.

Riggs understands that many real estate agents are busy and have difficulty juggling their workloads. Smart Alto provides agents with the assistance they need to successfully manage their workload, freeing up more time for family, friends and to focus on developing new business. By helping agents tackle the administrative tasks that consume their time, they can focus more on real estate tasks that generate revenue.

Furthermore, Smart Alto's technology provides real-time analytics, which helps agents analyze their outreach and stay on top of client needs. They can see what has and hasn’t worked so that they can adjust their outreach and communication strategies accordingly. The data visualizations are easy to read and provide insight to upcoming lead opportunities.

With Smart Alto, agents can maintain a higher level of engagement with their clients. The company’s virtual assistants provide 24/7 service that responds to inquiries quickly, ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks. While conventional real estate agents sometimes struggle to provide quick response times, Smart Alto assists with quick responses to questions that lead to increased engagement and conversions.

Smart Alto helps agents make more sales by providing superior customer service, engaging with clients effectively, and using data analytics to make informed decisions. With this technology, real estate agents can close more deals and earn more money. With more deals closed, it's easier for agents to expand, whether they are looking to hire new team members or increase marketing budgets.

Hassan Riggs' innovative ideas and his company, Smart Alto, are transforming the real estate industry. They are helping agents achieve more success by reaching more customers and closing more deals. With Smart Alto’s technology, agents won't need to worry about the administrative aspects of real estate clients because they have automated systems supporting them. Smart Alto is an excellent example of how technology can revolutionize an industry and make businesses more successful.

Hassan Riggs has one goal in mind with his tech startup: to help make real estate agents more money.

 

Riggs is the founder of Smart Alto, a qualification and appointment-setting platform designed to help real estate agents make additional money each year. The company’s platform integrates with agents’ lead sources, prescreens new leads, filters false inquiries, sends targeted text messages to the right leads at the right time, and ultimately enables agents to schedule five times more appointments than they would by themselves, Riggs told Lifewire in a phone interview.

 

"When I was in college, I worked in the real estate space, so I knew that real estate agents often did not have the time to consistently follow up with online leads," he said.

 

"This idea was always in the back of my head. Then in 2017, me and a buddy started Smart Alto because I knew this problem existed and we wanted to help real estate agents who were already doing well take their business to the next level."

 

On average, realtors make an additional $40,000 a year when they use Smart Alto’s platform, according to Riggs. In the past four years, Riggs has been able to scale and grow his business with the help of accelerator programs. 

 
##   It Takes Change to Grow  
 

Hassan was doing digital marketing consulting for Hilton in the Washington, DC area prior to joining Y Combinator to launch Smart Alto. He was a part of the startup accelerator’s winter 2017 cohort, and he's since secured $820,000 in funding, bringing his total venture capital raised to $1.1 million.

Quick Facts
 
Name: Hassan Riggs
 

While Smart Alto is based in Birmingham, Alabama, Riggs personally has since relocated to San Francisco, and leads a distributed team of 10 employees from there. Smart Alto encompasses a team that includes sales, engineering, product, design and customer success specialists.

 

Though the company was poised for growth heading into 2020, following a year in which it doubled its revenue, Riggs said everything changed when the pandemic hit. 

 

"We made some really tough changes," he said. "In order to keep the business alive, I implemented a COVID-19 strategy, and a part of that was, we re-negotiated all of our contracts."

 

These negotiations included securing discounts from business partners and helping customers work out payment plans, to avoid cancellations.

 

While a lot of tech companies halted hiring last spring, Riggs said that adding some team members in sales, customer success, and engineering has helped his company thrive through the pandemic.

 
Don’t despise small beginnings. Start small and make progress every single day.
 

"People were pulling back from a lot of growth areas and we started to double down on growth," he said. "By focusing primarily on growth with our hires, we were able to sustain our company growth. We ended up growing our team by 30% year over year."

 
##   More Access Is Needed  
 

Riggs said his No. 1 challenge as a Black tech founder has been access to both investors and knowledge capital. 

 

"Yes, we did raise money but, man, it was a true drive," he said. "Going through Y Combinator and AngelPad definitely gave us credibility, but it was hard just getting introductions to people because, the reality is, most people who say they want to help really don’t."

 

Riggs said Smart Alto has been able to build relationships with strategic investors in Birmingham, which is where the company raised the majority of its funding and why it is still headquartered there today.

 

These relationships with Birmingham investors are what helped Riggs grow his network of mentors and advisors. He said while Silicon Valley-based Y Combinator wanted Smart Alto to remain headquartered on the West Coast, that just wasn’t viable for his business plans. 

 

"The reality is, that wasn’t the best place for us to grow our business," he said. "We had to pivot, move, shape, and evolve to find the best place for us, and that happened to be Birmingham."

 

This year, Riggs is looking to double in business again, grow the company's sales team, and land contracts with some big customers. Right now, the majority of Smart Alto’s business comes from individual real estate agents and small teams, so Riggs is eager to get into enterprise sales. 

 

For aspiring Black tech founders, Riggs said it's important to not lose momentum in this sometimes discouraging sector. He also stressed the significance of starting to build strong professional relationships as soon as you can. 

 

"Man, I could write a book on this," he said. "Don’t despise small beginnings. Start small and make progress every single day."
