# Unlock the Ultimate Agent Status with this Insane Trick on Hitman 3's "How the Turntables" Challenge!

As an Agent 47 fan, you're well-aware of the challenges that await you in the world of assassination. Hitman 3, the latest entry in the series, has taken the franchise's iconic gameplay to new heights with its fresh approach to stealth and improvisation.

One of the most challenging levels in the game is the "How the Turntables" mission. It takes place in Dubai, where Agent 47 is tasked with assassinating targets in the Burj Dubai. The mission is challenging, but it's also packed with opportunities to show off your mastery of the game's mechanics.

In this article, we'll share with you an insane trick to help you unlock the ultimate Agent status for the "How the Turntables" challenge. Read on to learn how to master this level and prove your worth as a top Hitman 3 player.

## What is the "How the Turntables" Challenge?

The "How the Turntables" challenge is one of the many feats you'll need to conquer to earn mastery points in Hitman 3. It requires you to assassinate the targets in Dubai while dressed as the disc jockey.

To complete the challenge, you'll need to eliminate the targets while wearing a specific outfit. You can't use any disguises or kill anyone while in the costume unless you're taking out the targets.

The challenge is quite challenging as there are other DJs walking around in the same outfit as you. Also, your cover could be blown if a guard sees you holding a weapon or acting suspiciously.

## Unlock the Ultimate Agent Status in the "How the Turntables" Challenge

To achieve the ultimate Agent status in this challenge, you'll need to complete it in record time. The best way to do this is by taking advantage of a specific glitch that allows you to quickly access the targets by climbing into the air ducts.

First, start the mission as usual, but make sure you're carrying the explosive barrel with you. Then, head down the hall and turn right, and you should see a large crate near the yellow scaffolding.

Place the barrel down and shoot it to create an explosion that'll move the crate away from the wall. Next, climb on top of the crate and make your way to the air ducts between the third and fourth floors.

Once inside the air ducts, you can quickly make your way to the targets' location while also avoiding any guards or security measures. You'll need to exit the ducts on the fourth floor and head to the central display area.

Once there, you should see the targets sitting at the bar. Take them out quickly, and then exit the area as quickly as possible. If done correctly, you should be able to complete the challenge in a matter of minutes.

## Final Thoughts

The "How the Turntables" challenge may be challenging, but it's doable if you know what you're doing. By using the air duct glitch, you can quickly access the targets and complete the challenge in record time.

Remember to take things slowly and carefully, and always have an escape plan in the event that things go wrong. With a little bit of practice and patience, you'll be able to unlock the ultimate Agent status and become a Hitman 3 master.

So, what are you waiting for? It's time to take on the "How the Turntables" challenge and show the world what you're capable of!
