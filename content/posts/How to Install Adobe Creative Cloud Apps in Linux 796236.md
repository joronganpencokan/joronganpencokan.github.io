Title: Not a Windows User? No Problem! Learn the Sneaky Trick to Install Adobe Creative Cloud on Your Linux Machine Now!

Are you someone who prefers Linux over Windows, but you still want to use Adobe Creative Cloud? Well, you're in luck because there's a sneaky trick that you can use to install Adobe Creative Cloud on your Linux machine.

So let's begin with the basics. Adobe Creative Cloud is a suite of applications that includes Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and many more. Creative Cloud is the most popular and widely used software suite for graphic designers, photographers, and digital artists.

The problem, however, is that Adobe Creative Cloud is not available for Linux. Adobe has not yet released a Linux version of Creative Cloud, which means that Linux users have no other option but to use an alternative software or dual boot into Windows to use Creative Cloud.

But, what if we told you that there's a way to install Adobe Creative Cloud on your Linux machine, without having to switch to Windows? Yes, it's possible, and it's easier than you think.

Here's the sneaky trick to installing Adobe Creative Cloud on Linux:

Step 1: Install Wine

Wine is a free and open-source software that allows you to run Windows applications on Linux. You need to install Wine on your Linux machine first to get Creative Cloud running.

Open your Linux terminal and type the following command to install Wine:

sudo apt-get install wine

Step 2: Download Adobe Creative Cloud Setup

Now, download the Creative Cloud setup for Windows from Adobe's website. You can download the setup using a web browser or using the terminal.

Option 1 - Download using Web Browser:

1. Open your web browser and visit Adobe's website.
2. Log in to your Adobe account or create a new one.
3. Go to the Creative Cloud section and click on "Download Creative Cloud."
4. Select Windows as the operating system and click on "Download."

Option 2 - Download using the Terminal:

1. Open your Linux terminal and type the following command to download the Creative Cloud setup:

wget https://ccmdl.adobe.com/AdobeProducts/KCCC/1/linux32/ACCCx1_1_0_35.zip

2. Extract the downloaded zip file using the following command:

unzip ACCCx1_1_0_35.zip

Step 3: Install Adobe Creative Cloud on Linux

Once you have downloaded the Creative Cloud setup, follow these steps to install it on your Linux machine:

1. Open the Linux terminal and navigate to the folder where the setup file was downloaded.

cd /path/to/downloaded/file

2. Right-click on the setup file and select "Open With Wine Windows Program Loader."

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Creative Cloud. Make sure to select your preferred language and install location.

4. Once the installation is complete, open Adobe Creative Cloud from the start menu or by typing the following command in the terminal:

wine '/home/<your-username>/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Adobe/Adobe Creative Cloud/CoreSync/CoreSync-Setup.exe'

And that's it! You now have Adobe Creative Cloud installed and ready to use on your Linux machine.

Conclusion

Adobe Creative Cloud is essential for many designers and artists, and it's frustrating that it's not officially available for Linux. But with the sneaky trick we just shared, Linux users can now install and use Creative Cloud without having to switch to Windows.

Remember, while running Windows applications on Linux using Wine is possible, it's not always perfect. Therefore, some Creative Cloud applications might not work correctly, or you might encounter some bugs. However, this sneaky trick is definitely worth trying out if you're a Linux user who wants to install Creative Cloud.

Adobe’s suite of Creative Cloud apps are relied upon by many people for professional and personal use, but these programs have not been ported to Linux officially despite incessant requests from Linux users. This is presumably because of the tiny market share that Desktop Linux currently has.
 
Despite this, the community has found ways to bring Adobe apps to your Linux Desktop through Wine. But it can be difficult to get the Creative Cloud suite working in Wine due to compatibility issues with the multiple versions of the setup program available from Adobe’s website.
 
To solve this problem, Corbin Davenport created an installation script that helps you install any of the Adobe Creative Cloud apps on Linux without all the hassle. The script takes care of all the necessary configuration details and makes use of a lot of patches and tweaks to get things working.
 
## Installing PlayOnLinux
 
The Creative Cloud Script was made to work with PlayOnLinux which is a GUI Front-End for Wine that allows you to easily install and use numerous apps and games designed to run with Microsoft Windows, so you need to install that first. Here’s how to install PlayOnLinux on the following Linux Distributions:
 
Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based distributions
 
Debian
 
Fedora
 
OpenSUSE
 
Arch Linux
 
### Other Linux Distributions
 
Even if your distribution does not have PlayOnLinux in its repositories, there’s still a good chance you’ll be able to install it through some other means. There’s a generic package provided on the PlayOnLinux website that should work with any Linux distro, so consider checking that first.
 
## How to Use the Creative Cloud Script
 
Once you have PlayOnLinux installed, download the Creative Cloud script from its Github Repository and save it to your computer.
 
Next, launch PlayOnLinux, go to “Tools -> Run a local script,” then select the script you just downloaded.
 

 
Hit “Next” to begin the installation process. This could take a while, so be patient. Eventually, once the installation completes, you should be able to launch Adobe Application Manager from PlayOnLinux and use it to sign in with your Adobe ID and download your Creative Cloud applications.
 
Note that this script does not give you free access to Adobe’s Creative suite. It only makes it easy for you to set up the Adobe Creative Cloud desktop program which can be used to install and update Photoshop, Lightroom, Dreamweaver, Illustrator, and other apps.
 
You will need a free Adobe ID and a paid subscription to download and use most of the applications in the suite.
 
## Wrap Up
 
This script is not required to run Adobe CC apps on Linux. With a little patience, you can reproduce the same results even without using PlayOnLinux. However, using this script will make things much easier for you.
 
Keep in mind that not every Adobe CC app will run on your Linux PC. According to the developer, only Photoshop CC, Bridge CC, Lightroom 5, and the Creative Cloud manager have been extensively tested, so your mileage may vary.
