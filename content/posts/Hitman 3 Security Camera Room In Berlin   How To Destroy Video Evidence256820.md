Unleash your Inner Assassin and Learn How to Eradicate Security Cameras in Hitman 3's Berlin Level! Say Goodbye to Video Evidence Forever!

Hitman 3 has proven to be one of the most intriguing games of its time. With its advanced mechanics and immersive gameplay, it's no wonder that players all around the world have been in awe since the game's release. While the Hitman games have always focused on stealth and strategy, Hitman 3 has taken these elements and refined them further to create a game that is more challenging and rewarding than ever before.

One of the key features of Hitman 3's Berlin Level is the security cameras that litter the map. These cameras can be a pain to deal with, as they record your every move, making it difficult to maintain your anonymity. However, if you wish to become the ultimate assassin, you must learn how to take charge of the situation and make the security cameras work to your advantage. Here are some tips to help you eradicate security cameras in Hitman 3's Berlin Level!

Understand the camera's vision

Before we delve into ways to remove security cameras, it's necessary to understand how they work. Security cameras can only see within a specific range, and you can use this knowledge to your advantage. By scoping out the camera's vision, you can move around undetected, and the camera will never pick up on your location. If you need to move closer to the camera, try to move in a zigzag pattern to avoid detection.

Disabling the cameras

The most straightforward way to eliminate cameras is to shoot them. A well-placed shot will cause the camera to malfunction, and it will no longer record your movements. However, shooting cameras is noisy and will attract the attention of nearby guards. If you're going to go down this route, make sure to take out the guards around the cameras first.

Another way to disable cameras is to use electronic devices such as EMPs. These devices will also disable the cameras, but the range is limited. Make sure to get up close to the camera before using an EMP.

Bypassing the camera

One of the most crucial elements of being an assassin is the ability to slip past unnoticed. If you need to slip past a camera without being seen, use disguises to your advantage. By dressing up as a guard or waiter, you can move around undetected. Make sure to take note of your surroundings and pick disguises that blend in. Some disguises may make you stand out, which is not ideal.

Another way to bypass cameras is to move through shadows. Stay close to walls, and make use of the dark corners of the map to stay hidden. Again, zigzagging will help you move in areas that may be exposed to the camera.

In conclusion, security cameras can be a thorn in your side when it comes to completing Hitman 3's Berlin Level, but with the right knowledge and strategy, you can eradicate these cameras, and no one will ever know that you were there. Remember to move in zigzag patterns, destroy/ disable cameras, and use disguises or shadows to slip under the radar. Become the ultimate assassin and leave no traces behind.
