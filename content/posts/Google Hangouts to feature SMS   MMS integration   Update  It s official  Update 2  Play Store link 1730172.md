Revolutionizing Messaging: Google Hangouts Unveils SMS/MMS Integration! You Won't Believe What It Means For Your Conversations! Check Out the Exciting Update Now with Play Store Link!

With messaging becoming an integral part of our daily lives, it's no surprise that tech giants like Google are continually taking innovative steps to simplify communication. Recently, Google Hangouts unveiled an exciting update by integrating SMS/MMS within its app. This development is a game-changer for Hangouts users as it makes conversing with friends and family even more convenient and seamless. Let's dive deeper into this exciting update and discover how it revolutionizes messaging!

Google Hangouts is a popular messenger app developed by Google Inc. Its unique features include video and voice calling, messaging, and even the ability to send pictures and animated GIFs. However, despite its many features, users often lamented the inability of Hangouts to integrate SMS/MMS messages into the app. This meant that users would have to toggle between Hangouts and their messaging app to stay updated and keep the conversation going. But, all that has now changed with the latest Google Hangouts update.

The update is easy to access, and you can download it from the Play Store. Once you have it installed, you'll be greeted by a prompt to set up SMS/MMS integration within the app. With this feature activated, all incoming and outgoing SMS/MMS messages will now appear within the Hangouts app, alongside regular messaging conversations. The new integration feature means that users can enjoy all the usual benefits of messaging through the familiar interface of Hangouts- all in one place!

Not only is this new feature convenient, but it also adds a new level of functionality to Hangouts. No longer will users have to worry about switching between apps for voice, video, or text conversations. Everything is now available in one app. Moreover, this integration also extends to voice and video calls, allowing users to make and receive calls within Hangouts seamlessly. The benefits of SMS/MMS integration make the communication experience seamless and hassle-free.

But that's not all; Google has also added some new features that make conversing within Hangouts even more enjoyable. For instance, the updated app now enables users to share location, further enhancing the chatting experience. Everybody needs to send their location at some point, and this feature makes it simpler than ever before. Users can also access a broader range of emojis, stickers, and gifs within the app, allowing them to convey emotions more effectively.

In conclusion, the integration of SMS/MMS into Hangouts has revolutionized the messaging experience for its users. With this new development, messaging, voice, and video calls are all available in one place. Users can spend more time chatting and sharing moments with friends and family while enjoying all the great functionalities of the Hangouts app. To take advantage of this new update, head on down to the Play Store and get the latest Hangouts app! Happy chatting!


When it was launched, it was expected that Google Hangouts would feature the ability to send and receive SMS as well much like iMessage. The expectation seems to be coming alive now after a leak from Android Police which shows those features in Hangouts version 1.3.
 
Although this is just a rumour, the evidence is strong and in a way is a much expected move from Google. Hangouts already has the ability to send and receive instant messages and video chats (one to one and group) and introducing this SMS and MMS integration would mean Google would be plugging a hole in Hangouts with another useful feature.
 
Google has not released their plan for Hangouts 1.3 but these leaks suggest that development is going well and strong and can be released sooner than we expect.
 
Hangouts has already replaced Google Messenger and Talk. So, after the integration of the messaging features where do you thing the future of the default Messaging app would be?
 
 
 
Update: It’s official now.
 
In Google’s event on Oct. 29, 2013, Google has confirmed the following updates rolling out to Hangouts.
 
- Location sharing : You can now send a map of your current location via Hangouts
 - Send & Receive SMS : Time to say goodbye to the native messaging app. Sending & Receiving SMS will now be integrated into Hangouts.
 - Support for animated GIFs : Animated GIFs will play inline in the text within Hangouts

 
Besides these, the video calling feature has also been given a significant improvement. Hangouts can now automatically enhance webcam lighting to improve the user experience.
 
According to Google’s official blog, “The Android app and video calling features will be available in a few days, while the On Air improvements will roll out over the next few weeks.”
 
Update 2: The app is now officially available in the Play Store. You can download it from there. Here is the link
