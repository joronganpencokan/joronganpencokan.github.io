Body:

The Dartmoor level of Hitman 3 may seem daunting at first, but it is one of the most satisfying levels to complete. Your mission is to eliminate Alexa Carlisle, who happens to be the head of the Carlisle family. To complete this mission, you must gain access to Alexa's office safe, where the ultimate secret lies. The safe's code is crucial to the mission's success, and you must know how to crack it if you hope to finish the game successfully.

The first thing you need to know is where to find the safe code. You should know that the code isn't too far from the safe itself. Start by heading to the mansion's greenhouse, which is located to the left of the main entrance. In the greenhouse, you'll find Emma Carlisle, Alexa's niece. Emma is a key figure in the game as she can give you access to the safe code.

To get the safe code from Emma, you need to assume a false identity. Do this by heading to Alexa's office, which is located on the top floor of the mansion. Inside the office, you'll find a photograph of Zachary Carlisle, Alexa's nephew, on the desk. Pick it up and reveal the secret entrance behind the bookshelf. Inside the secret room, you'll find a Butler uniform that you can use to disguise yourself as Zachary.

Once you've obtained the Butler uniform, head to the greenhouse and talk to Emma while wearing your disguise. Emma will divulge the safe code, which is 1975. Use this to unlock Alexa's office safe and get the ultimate secret.

Conclusion:

Hitman 3 is an excellent game that features a variety of levels, intriguing storylines, and puzzles that require skill and finesse.
