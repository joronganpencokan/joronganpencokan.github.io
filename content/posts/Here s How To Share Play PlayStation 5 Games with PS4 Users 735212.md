# Unlock The Ultimate Gaming Experience: Share Play Playstation 5 Games with PS4 Users Now!

Are you a Playstation owner who loves to play games with friends, but can't always afford the latest console? Do you constantly miss out on gaming experiences that are exclusive to newer consoles because your friends are unable to play with you? Well, it looks like Sony has found a solution to your problem! With the latest update, PS4 users can now share-play PS5 games with their friends, regardless of which console they own! 

So, what exactly is share play? Share play is a feature that allows you to play games with friends who do not own the same console as you, in a variety of ways. From watching or playing games together to passing the controller back and forth, the feature offers a unique way of connecting and gaming with friends.

With the release of the Playstation 5, many gamers were eager to experience everything that the new console had to offer. However, the hefty price tag for the console and the limited availability made it difficult for some gamers to access it. But now, with the introduction of share play for PS4 users, this is no longer a concern.

This latest feature update from Sony enables PS4 users to jump into the latest games exclusive to PS5 alongside their friends who own the console. Share play provides access to a vast range of PS5 games that previously were not available to PS4 users. 

But how does it work?

Once you have established a connection with your friend, you can invite them to join a share play session. Once they have entered the session, they can access and play the latest games exclusive to PS5, all while being hosted from your PS4 console. Your friend can even download the game to their console, allowing them to continue playing should they decide to buy the game for their PS5 in the future.

Share play doesn't just focus on the latest games, either. You can also use the feature to play your favorite PS4 games with your friends, regardless of whether or not they own the game. You can even use the feature to co-op in games, allowing you to play with your friend as if you were sitting next to each other.

In conclusion, Sony's decision to enable share play for PS4 users was a fantastic move for the gaming community. It bridges the gap between the two consoles and allows gamers who can't yet afford to upgrade to the PlayStation5 to experience the latest games alongside their friends. This feature not only enhances the overall experience but also encourages community building and gaming together. So, what are you waiting for? Unlock the ultimate gaming experience and share play PS5 games with your PS4 friends today!

As Sony Interactive Entertainment announced, the share play feature has been expanded again. From now on, cross-generational or share play sessions between PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 users are also possible.
 
## How To Share Play PlayStation 5 Games with PS4 Players
 
With the Share-Play feature, the PlayStation 4 was given a function a few years ago with which it is possible to let a friend or fellow player participate in your own game.
 
In practice, this means that PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 users can now also connect to each other. Nothing has changed in the actual process of Share Play.
 
As before, you can call up the feature via the party menu and invite a friend. If your friend joins your session, they can watch your game happening and even take control of your game by giving them the appropriate clearance.
 
In addition, you can use Share Play to play the local co-op mode of your games via the PlayStation Network without your fellow player having to own a copy of the respective game.
 
In order to be able to use Share-Play, both players must have a sufficiently fast Internet connection (~2 Mbit/s) and a valid PlayStation Plus member. The duration of a session is a maximum of 60 minutes.
 
You can find all further details about Share Play on the official website.
 

 
PS5 and PS4 players can now Share Play together. Use Share Play to let a friend watch your gameplay, or even pass controllers virtually so they can try the game out. Learn more about Share Play here: https://t.co/wX7OIUwY1h pic.twitter.com/P8pguVGWb3
