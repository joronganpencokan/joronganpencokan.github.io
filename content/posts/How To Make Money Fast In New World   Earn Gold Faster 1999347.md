Step 4: Join an Expedition Group

Expeditions are one of the most lucrative ways to earn gold in New World. They are challenging, but the rewards are high. Joining an expedition group means you can take part in expeditions with other players, increasing the chances of successfully completing them. And, upon successful completion, you'll earn rare loot, which can be sold for a high price.
