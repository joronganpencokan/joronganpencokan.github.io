Unlock Your Google Account In Style With Touch and Face ID Authentication!

In this fast-paced digital age, securing your Google account has become an essential thing to do. From emails to important documents and photos, you store everything on your Google account. In this scenario, you can't afford to lose your Google account due to theft, hacking, or any other unauthorized access. Fortunately, Google offers two-factor authentication through Touch ID and Face ID authentication methods to ensure the safety of your account's data.

Touch ID

Touch ID is a biometric system developed by Apple that uses fingerprints for authentication. The technology made its first appearance in the iPhone 5S in 2013, and since then, it has become a common feature in most of Apple's mobile devices, including the most recent MacBook Pro.

To activate Touch ID authentication for your Google account, follow the simple steps below:

- For iOS devices, go to the Google app, and in the top-left corner, select the menu. Then, open the option for "Settings," followed by "Screen lock."
- On the next screen, choose "fingerprint" or "Touch ID," depending on the device you are using.
- After that, enroll your fingerprint for authentication purposes.

Face ID

Face ID is another biometric authentication method, which uses facial recognition technology to unlock and authenticate devices. Apple launched Face ID back in 2017 alongside the iPhone X, which was the first device to have this technology.

To set up Face ID authentication for your Google account, follow these steps:

- Go to the Google app, select the menu in the top-left corner, and open the "Settings" option.
- Click on "Screen lock," followed by "Face ID."
- Then, you need to scan your face within the frame, making sure you are looking directly at the screen until the scan is complete.

The Bottom Line

Google's two-factor authentication using Touch ID and Face ID not only provides a secure way of accessing your account but also saves time by avoiding the need for constantly entering a password. The process is straightforward and offers convenience and peace of mind to users. So, why not secure your Google account with Touch ID or Face ID today?

Google has updated its Authenticator app for iOS devices to include a Privacy Screen setting, which will allow you to require Touch ID or Face ID to access two-factor authentication codes.

 

The newest Google Authenticator update, version 3.2.0 of the iOS app, has added a feature called Privacy Screen that makes revealing authentication codes even more secure. By setting up the Privacy Screen option you'll be able to require the app to verify your identity via Touch ID or Face ID before it will display your two-factor authentication codes.

 

As MacRumors points out, you previously needed to use Touch ID or Face ID in order to export accounts, however, it was not an option for simply displaying your 2FA codes in the app. The new Privacy Screen option can be set to require an ID check immediately, or after 10 seconds, 1 minute, or 10 minutes.

 

There is some conjecture about whether this update will be enough to satisfy iOS users, due to the recent news that Apple will be including a built-in multi-factor authenticator with iOS 15.

 

With iOS 15's password settings reportedly auto-filling the generated codes whenever you log in, there might not be a need to use a separate app anymore.

 

Some users also have noted that this functionality is arriving a bit behind Google's competitors. In response to the news, MysticalOS wroteon Twitter, "too little too late.. it took them too long to even add device transfer and now this? Microsoft authenticator had both ages ago."
