Tier lists are an essential tool for any Grand Summoners player. They help you understand which characters are the most powerful so that you can make the best team for your battles. The tier list is based on a character's abilities, overall stats, and how they perform in battles. This list is updated every year to reflect any changes in the game.

So, without any further ado, let's dive into the Grand Summoners Tier List 2023.

## Tier S

The characters in this tier are the most potent and versatile characters in the game. They are the ones you should have on your team if you want to win every battle. They have high stats, great abilities, and can dish out insane damage.

Some of the characters in this tier are Leon, Riviera, and Vox. Leon has high attack and great skills that can deal massive damage to enemies. Riviera is a great support character that can heal allies and buff their stats. Vox is a powerhouse character that can deal a lot of damage and buff allies' stats.
