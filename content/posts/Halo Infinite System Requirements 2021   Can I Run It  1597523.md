# You Won't Believe the INSANE System Requirements for Halo Infinite 2021 - Can YOUR Computer Handle it?

Halo Infinite 2021, the latest installment in Microsoft’s massively popular first-person shooter franchise, is set to be released later this year. However, if you’re planning on playing the game on your PC, you might want to take a closer look at the system requirements before you get your hopes up.

The system requirements for Halo Infinite 2021 have been released, and they are absolutely insane. To play the game at its highest settings, you’ll need a PC that’s more powerful than most gaming rigs on the market today.

Here are the minimum and recommended system requirements for Halo Infinite 2021:

**Minimum System Requirements:**

- OS: Windows 10 RS3 x64
- Processor: AMD FX-8370 or Intel Core i5-4440
- Memory: 8GB RAM
- Graphics card: AMD Radeon RX 570 or Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti
- DirectX: DirectX 12 Ultimate
- Storage: 50GB

**Recommended System Requirements:**

- OS: Windows 10 20H1 x64
- Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X or Intel Core i7-9700K
- Memory: 16GB RAM
- Graphics card: AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT or Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070
- DirectX: DirectX 12 Ultimate
- Storage: 50GB SSD

The first thing you’ll notice is that the minimum and recommended system requirements are pretty far apart. The minimum requirements might let you play the game, but you’ll be doing it at low settings and with poor performance.

To play the game at its highest settings, you’ll need a PC with a top-of-the-line CPU and GPU. The AMD Ryzen 7 3700X is an eight-core, 16-thread CPU that’s one of the most powerful on the market today. The recommended graphics card, the AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT, is also a top-tier card that can handle any game you throw at it.

If you haven’t upgraded your PC in a while, you might be in for a shock when you see the system requirements for Halo Infinite 2021. However, if you’re a serious PC gamer who wants to play the game at its best, it might be time to invest in some new hardware.

So, can your computer handle the new Halo game? That depends on your PC’s specs. If your CPU and GPU are powerful enough, you should be able to play the game with decent settings and performance. If not, you might want to consider an upgrade.

In conclusion, Halo Infinite 2021 is going to be a demanding game that will require a high-end PC to run at its best. If you’re planning on playing the game on your computer, make sure you check the system requirements before you buy it. If you need to upgrade your hardware, now might be the time to do it.
