You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Access the Secrets of Your Desktop Computer With This Simple Trick!

You might think that your desktop computer is a complete mystery, but believe it or not, there are actually some secrets that you can uncover with a few simple steps. Whether you're looking to improve your computer's performance or just curious about what's hidden away in your files, this quick and easy trick can reveal all!

The first step is to open up the Command Prompt on your computer. This might sound daunting if you're not familiar with it, but don't worry – it's actually very simple. Just press the Start button on your keyboard, type in cmd, and hit Enter.

Once the Command Prompt window opens up, type in the following command: "systeminfo". This will display a whole host of information about your computer, including things like the processor type, the amount of installed RAM, and even the version of Windows that you're running.

But that's just the beginning – there are plenty more tricks up the sleeve of the Command Prompt. For example, if you want to see a list of all the programs and processes that are currently running on your computer, simply type in "tasklist" and hit Enter. This will give you a detailed breakdown of everything that's currently open, so you can pinpoint any performance issues or potentially problematic applications.

Another useful trick is to check your computer's IP address. If you're not sure what this is, it's essentially a unique identifier that allows other devices on the same network to connect to your computer. To find out what your IP address is, simply enter "ipconfig" into the Command Prompt and hit Enter. You'll then see a list of information, including your IP address and your default gateway.

And finally, if you want to take a deeper dive into your computer's files and folders, the Command Prompt is the best way to do it. You can use commands like "dir" to see a directory listing of all the files and folders in a particular location, or "cd" to change directory and navigate to a specific folder.

So there you have it – with just a few simple tricks, you can quickly and easily access all the secrets of your desktop computer. Whether you're a tech enthusiast looking to optimize your system or just curious to see what's under the hood, the Command Prompt is a powerful tool that can give you all the answers you need. So get started today and start exploring the hidden depths of your computer!

This article explains how to open a desktop computer case, which houses all parts of a computer. Every computer is a little different, but these instructions will point you in the right direction no matter what case you may have.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- First, turn off computer and unplug power cable. Remove all external cables and attachments.Next, remove outermost screws from case. Do not remove screws that secure power supply to case.Finally, remove the case side panel.

 
##   Turn the Computer Off  
 

Before opening the case, you must turn the computer off.

 

Shut down your operating system as you normally do. On the back of your computer, locate the power switch and turn it off, as shown above.

 

Some computers don't have a power switch on the back. If you don't find one, skip to the next step.

 
If the computer isn't turning off from inside the OS, you can pull the plug from the wall (see step 2 below), but that isn't the safest method. Here's what to do if Windows 11 won't shut down.
 
##   Unplug the Power Cable  
 

Unplug the power cable that's currently plugged in to the power supply on the back of your computer.

 
This is an important step! It may seem overly cautious to remove the power cable in addition to powering off the computer normally, but some parts of a computer remain powered on even when the computer seems to be off. Plus, if you end up needing to move the computer to a different location while working on it, like if you plan to clean the PC outside, it'll need to be detached from the power source anyway.
 
##   Remove All External Cables and Attachments  
 

Remove all cables and other devices attached to your computer. This will make it much easier to work and to move it around as needed.

 

Most of what's plugged in can be gently pulled out as you'd expect, like HDMI cables, speakers, and USB devices, but other things have a different release mechanism.

 

An Ethernet cable (pictured above) has a small, plastic clip that must be pressed inward as you pull, else it could break off in the process. Older video cables like VGA and DVI have their own screws, though they might not be screwed in, anyway, depending on how it was attached in the first place.

 
##   Remove the Side Panel Retaining Screws  
 

Remove the outermost screws from the case—the ones that are holding the side panels to the rest of the case. You'll likely need a Phillips-head screwdriver to remove these screws, but some cases have screws you can turn by hand.

 

Set them aside, or unscrew them as far as you can if this case doesn't have fully removable screws. You'll need to use them to secure the side panels to the case again when you're through working inside your computer.

 
Take care not to remove the screws that are securing the power supply to the case. These screws are more inset than the case retaining screws and may cause the power supply to fall into the computer, possibly causing damage.
 
##   Remove the Case Side Panel  
 

The case side panel can now be removed.

 

Sometimes the panel can simply be lifted off, while other times it may be attached to the case in a slide-lock manner. No matter the mechanism, you should be able to easily jar it loose.
