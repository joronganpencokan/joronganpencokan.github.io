On Windows 10, you can download and install the group policy templates to manage Microsoft Edge settings, and this guide will show you the process. Out-of-the-box, the Chromium version of Edge comes with a set of features and recommended settings to browse the internet, but sometimes, depending on your environment, you may need to configure the experience differently to allow or deny users specific features or settings, and this went the templates comes in handy.
 
Administrative templates, as the name implies, are templates that contain group policy objects (GPO) that allows you to change system settings more granularly using the Local Group Policy Editor. Although most of the group policy objects are already availble on Windows 10, for the Chromium version of Microsoft Edge, you have to download and install the templates manually.

Usually, you’ll see three different sections after installing the templates, including Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Edge – Default Settings, and Microsoft Edge Update. The Microsoft Edge folder includes the mandatory policies that users cannot modify. The Microsoft Edge – Default Settings folder houses the recommended settings you can set as default, and the user can change to something different. And the Microsoft Edge Update folder has all the settings to manage updates for the browser, including the ability to disable update completely.
 
After making a policy change, you can confirm the policy by browsing to the edge://policy page to see all the policies that have been applied to the browser. 
 
We’re focusing this guide on Windows 10, but you can refer these steps for all supported versions of Windows. Also, these instructions are meant to add administrative templates on an individual computer, but if you’re using Active Directory and you need configure a fleet of devices, perhaps adding the templates through Active Directory is a more efficient approach.
