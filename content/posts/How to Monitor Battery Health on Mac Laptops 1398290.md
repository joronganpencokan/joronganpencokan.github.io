Is your Mac battery on the brink of death? Follow these easy steps to monitor its health and avoid expensive repairs!

In this digital era, having a computer has become a necessity for almost everyone. And when it comes to computers, Mac systems are the most popular ones among consumers. However, even the best technological advancements can be hampered by a dying battery.

As Mac users, we know how frustrating it can be to have a battery that starts behaving erratically, causing you to wonder if you’re on borrowed time. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to understand a Mac battery's health, prolong its life, and avoid costly repairs. In this article, we’ll discuss how to monitor your Mac system’s battery health.

Before we start, it's essential to understand that, over time, all batteries lose their ability to hold a charge, and you might have to replace your Mac's battery if it's aging. But, by keeping track of your battery health, you can detect any potential issues early enough to save money on the repairs. Let's dive in!

Step 1: Check your Battery Health:

Firstly, you need to check your battery's status. Apple provides an in-built tool, "System Information," that displays accurate battery information. To access this tool, click on the Apple logo on the top left corner, choose "About this Mac," then select "System Report."

Next, select the "Power" option, and you will see various battery information such as cycle count, condition, and full charge capacity. The cycle count refers to the number of times your battery has been recharged completely. Typically, a Mac battery should last up to 1000 cycles before needing to be replaced. The condition displays whether your battery is working optimally, while the full charge capacity shows the maximum amount of power your battery can hold.

Step 2: Calibrate Your Battery:

Calibrating your battery is a technique that resets the power measurement system in your MacBook, prompting it to give correct battery status. To calibrate the battery, you need to discharge it fully by using it until it shuts down. Afterward, leave your MacBook off for about five hours, then charge it fully using the power adapter. Once your battery is fully charged, disconnect the power adapter, and use your MacBook until your battery's level is around 5%.

Step 3: Reduce Power Consumption:

Reducing your MacBook's power consumption can help extend its life. One way to achieve this is to adjust your system's brightness to a comfortable level rather than having it at the highest point. Additionally, enabling the Energy Saver feature in your preferences will help your Mac go into sleep mode when it's idle.

Step 4: Optimize Applications:

Certain applications can drain your MacBook's battery faster than others. To optimize your Applications, use the Activity Monitor tool. This tool shows you which applications are using the most power, enabling you to shut down the offenders.

In conclusion, the health of your Mac's battery is crucial, and simple steps can help keep its performance in check. Always remember to check your battery health regularly, calibrate your battery, reduce power consumption and optimize your applications. With these easy steps, you can prolong your battery life and avoid costly repairs.

Understanding how Apple’s lithium-ion batteries function and perform over time can help you maximize the lifespan of your battery while maintaining peak energy performance for as long as possible. Learn how to care for the battery health on your Mac by monitoring usage, charge cycles, and battery life cycle status.
 
## How to Check the Number of Charge Cycles on Your Mac
 
- Click the Apple icon in the upper-left corner of the menu bar.

 
- Select “About This Mac” from the drop-down menu.

 
- Click on the “System Report” button in the new dialog window that appears.

 
- In the System Information app window, click “Hardware” in the upper-left corner to reveal a new menu.

 
- Select “Power” from this menu.

 
- Locate the current cycle count of your Mac’s battery under the “Battery Information” header in the right pane.

 
### Understanding Battery Charge Cycles
 
The lithium-ion batteries inside most MacBook models are designed to retain 80% of their original capacity after 1,000 charge cycles. You have performed one charge cycle once you have discharged 100% of your battery’s capacity. You can view the cycle count limit for your Mac’s battery by visiting Apple’s battery support page.
 
For example, if you consume 50% of your battery’s capacity before charging it back up to 100%, you have completed only half of a charge cycle. It’s a great idea to top off your Mac’s battery whenever you can to reduce the number of charge cycles.
 
A couple of battery-related terms you need to know about in addition to “charge cycle” are:
 
- Battery life: this is the amount of time your MacBook will run before it needs to be recharged.Battery lifespan: this is the amount of time your battery will last until it needs to be replaced.

 
## How to Check Battery Health on Mac
 
To check the battery health on your MacBook:
 
- Launch the System Preferences app.

 
- Navigate to the Battery settings menu by selecting “Battery.”

 
- Select “Battery” once more from the menu on the left.

 
- Click on the button at the lower right titled “Battery Health” and analyze the “Battery Condition” parameter using the status indicators.

 
### Status Indicators for Battery Health on Mac
 
Mac batteries are consumable components that will become less effective as they age. Your Mac will display one of two battery status indicators:
 
Normal: Your Mac notebook’s battery is functioning normally.
 
Service Recommended: The battery inside your Mac laptop is unable to hold a charge equivalent to its original capacity, or it is not functioning properly. You may also see a “Service Now” status at this point instead of “Service Recommended.” Take your Mac to an Apple-authorized service provider or Apple Store to get its battery serviced or replaced. You can fix a battery service warning using a few simple steps.
 
## How to Make Battery Percentage Visible in the Menu Bar
 
To monitor your battery more effectively, you can add a percentage indicator next to the battery icon in the menu bar. To do so:
 
- Navigate to the System Preferences app.

 
- Click on the “Dock & Menu Bar” icon to start customizing the menu bar.

 
- Locate the menu items on the left sidebar and scroll down to select “Battery” from the “Other Modules” section.

 
- Click the empty boxes next to the “Show in Menu Bar” and “Show Percentage” options. The battery icon should now appear in the menu bar.

 
## How to Conserve Battery Life on Your Mac
 
To activate various power-saving measures on your Mac, first visit “System Preferences -> Battery -> Battery.” Check or uncheck the box to the left of each setting as discussed here.
 
- Slightly dim the display while on battery power: check this box to conserve energy by immediately dimming screen brightness to 75% when you unplug your computer from power.Enable Power Nap while on battery power: leave this setting unchecked to prevent your Mac from using battery power to fetch iCloud, Mail, and other data during its sleep state.Automatic graphics switching: check this box to allow some MacBook Pro models to save battery life by dynamically switching between multiple graphics processors.Low power mode: check this box to slightly throttle performance on your Mac and increase overall battery life.

 
## Frequently Asked Questions

### I can't find the “Battery” menu in the System Settings app. What should I do?
 
On older versions of macOS the “Battery” menu item is labeled differently. Click on the “Energy Saver” menu item to locate the battery settings pane.
 
### Is it a good idea to discharge my Mac’s battery to 0% before charging it?
 
No. This practice will actually inflict unnecessary stress on your Mac’s battery, as it typically leads to the accumulation of more charge cycles within a shorter length of time. The capacity of all lithium-ion batteries is slightly reduced after each complete charge cycle, which is why routinely discharging your Mac’s battery before charging it will quickly reduce its battery life.
 
### Why does my Mac take so long to charge past 80%?
 
Apple’s lithium-ion batteries charge to 100% in two phases to extend battery lifespan. This process is called Optimized Battery Charging. In Stage 1, batteries fast charge to 80% capacity. In Stage 2, batteries ease into a slow charging or “trickle charge” state until they reach 100% capacity. In rare cases, your Mac may need to cool down before it can charge past 80% capacity. Thankfully, Apple provides recommended ambient temperature guidance for all MacBooks on its battery support website.
