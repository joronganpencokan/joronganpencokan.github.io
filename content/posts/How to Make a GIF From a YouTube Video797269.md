Have you ever watched a video on YouTube and thought, "Wow, this would make a great GIF?" Well, fortunately for you, there is a way to easily turn any YouTube video into a GIF and add more fun to your social media experience. 

The key to making a great GIF is finding the right moment in the video that captures the intended emotion.

5. Once you're happy with your selection, click "create GIF" and voila! Your GIF is ready to use 

Now, there are a couple of things you should bear in mind when looking for creating GIFs. First, make sure that you're using copyright approved content.
