## Unlock Your Ubuntu's Full Potential: Step-by-Step Guide to Installing Java Runtime!

Do you have an Ubuntu OS and are tired of not being able to use some applications because of missing dependencies? Look no further because installing Java Runtime could be the solution to your problem.

Java Runtime is essential software for running various applications, including web apps, games, and some software. The guide below provides you with a step-by-step solution to downloading and installing Java Runtime in your Ubuntu system.

### Step 1: Update your System

Before installing any software, it's critical to update your system. Open the Ubuntu terminal or command line and run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

Once the system updates, proceed to the next step.

### Step 2: Add the Java Repository

After updating the system, add the Java repository to Ubuntu using the command below:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
```

Then, press enter when prompted, and the system will take care of it.

### Step 3: Install Java Runtime

Once the repository is added to your system, run the command below to install Java Runtime:

```
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
```

The installation process will prompt you to accept the license agreement, after which you can proceed with the installation. Once the installation is complete, you can now verify the installation by running the command below:

```
java -version 
```

If the installation was successful, a message like "Java version 1.8.0_201" should appear.

### Step 4: Setup Java Environment Variables

After installing Java Runtime, it's essential to set up your environment variables. The environment variables help the system locate the necessary files and directories for Java. First, find the path to where Java was installed in your system by running the command below:

```
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```
The system will list all the installed Java versions and their paths. The correct path should be something like "/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java."

Next, export the path by running the command below:

```
export JAVA_HOME=path_to_java
```

Replace `path_to_java` with the correct path you found earlier. 

After running this command, edit the `/etc/environment` file and add the following:

```
JAVA_HOME="path_to_java"
```

Save the /etc/environment file and run the following command to activate the changes:

```
source /etc/environment
```

### Conclusion

By completing these four simple steps, you can now unlock your Ubuntu's full potential and run Java-based applications with ease. Installing Java Runtime will open up your system to a wide range of software, including the most demanding applications.

Remember to always update your system and make sure Java Runtime is correctly installed and set up with environment variables. Enjoy using Java-based applications on your Ubuntu OS!

Java is not installed by default in Ubuntu, but it is required to run Java applications, such as Minecraft, on your computer. This article will show you how to install Java Runtime in Ubuntu.
 
## What Is Java Runtime?
 
Java is an “interpreted” language, which means the code is not compiled into a ready-to-run executable. To run Java applications, you need to have a translator, known as a “runtime.” This runtime translates the program’s code in real time to instructions our computers understand, allowing us to run it.
 
## Check for Java
 
To check if you already have Java installed, use:
 
The output will tell you if you already have Java on your computer, and if not, which versions are available to install. Note them down, as you might need them later.
 
## Install Default Version
 
Out of all available versions of Java, one will be deemed “the default” for your distribution. It might not be a bleeding-edge version, but it’s usually the latest one that is considered stable, secure, and generally “the best” for most uses.
 
To install it, use:
 
After a while, and the installation of some extra dependencies, Java will be installed on your computer.
 
Use the java -version command again to check which version was installed.
 
Unfortunately, though, some programs that are created for a specific version of Java might run into problems when using different ones. Thankfully, there are solutions to such problems.
 
## JRE and JDK
 
To run Java code, you need the Java runtime. In rare cases, though, some related extras may be needed. They can be found in the full-blown Java Development Kit.
 
To install it, enter in your terminal:
 
## Install (and Switch to) Older Versions
 
If what you’re trying to run still fails, install an older version of Java just like you did for the default runtime. For example, to install the oldest version available at this time for Ubuntu 20.04, we used:
 
You don’t have to uninstall the Java version that’s already installed. Many versions can coexist in parallel. Only one of them is active at any given time, though. Even if you install an older version, that won’t solve the problem of not being able to run that jar file automatically. You first have to switch to the older version. To do that, use:
 
A numbered list of the available versions will appear in your terminal. An asterisk before the number will mark the active one. Press Enter on your keyboard to keep the active one or the number that corresponds to a different version followed by Enter to switch to it.
 
## Install Oracle Java
 
Stubborn programs may refuse to work with any open version of Java, demanding Oracle’s version. Unfortunately, installing Oracle’s Java is a bit more complicated. You have to manually download it first from Oracle’s official Java page.
 
Save the file somewhere, fire up a terminal and move to the same directory. Unleash dpkg on the downloaded file with:
 
Use the “update-alternatives” command we saw before to actually install the JDK with:
 
Remember to update the paths of the example for the version of Java you’re installing. Also note that you can switch between the “open” and Oracle’s version of Java like we saw before.
 
With Java installed, you can install and play Minecraft on Ubuntu.
