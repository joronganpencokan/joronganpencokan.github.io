# Unlock the Ultimate Multiplayer Advantage: Learn How to Merge Your Warzone 2 and MW2 Accounts for Cross Progression!

If you love playing Call of Duty and want to level up your game, merging your Warzone and MW2 accounts is a must-try. Cross progression allows you to transfer your progress from one game to another, so you can keep playing with your customized weapons, Operators, and rank. Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Log in to your Activision Account.

To access your account, go to the official Activision website and sign in using the email and password you used to create your account. If you have forgotten your login details, click on "Forgot Your Password" and follow the prompts to reset it.

Step 2: Connect your Warzone and MW2 Accounts.

Once you are logged into your account, navigate to the "Linked Accounts" section and select "Connect" under the "Modern Warfare" option. Follow the instructions to link your MW2 account to your Activision Account.

Step 3: Merge your Warzone and MW2 Progression.

With both accounts linked, you can now merge your Warzone and MW2 progression. To do this, open Call of Duty Warzone, go to the "Options" menu, and select "Account." From there, you should see a prompt to merge your accounts. Follow the instructions to complete the process.

Benefits of Cross Progression

Now that you've merged your accounts, you'll see the benefits of cross progression right away. Any progress you make in either game will be reflected in the other. Here are some examples:

- Customized Weapons: If you've unlocked a weapon skin in MW2, you can now use it in Warzone.
- Operators: You can use the Operators you've unlocked in MW2 in Warzone and vice versa.
- Battle Pass: Progress made in one game will also count towards the Battle Pass in the other.

Conclusion

Merging your Warzone and MW2 accounts is a game-changer when it comes to multiplayer gaming. Not only does it allow you to keep your customized weapons and Operators, but it also saves you time as you no longer have to start from scratch in each game. So what are you waiting for? Give cross progression a try and unlock the ultimate multiplayer advantage!

Another important thing to note is that you may unlink individual platform accounts from an Activision account once every 12 months. So do it wisely.
