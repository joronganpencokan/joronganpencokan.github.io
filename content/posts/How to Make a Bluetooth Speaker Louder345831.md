Title: Unlock The Secret To Epic Bluetooth Sound - Learn The Simple Trick To Pump Up Your Speaker Volume Now!

Introduction:
Bluetooth speakers are a revolutionary development in the world of technology. These devices allow you to listen to your favorite music from your phone, laptop or tablet without the need for wires. However, many Bluetooth speakers don’t provide the volume that most people desire, which can be disappointing. In this article, we will explain how to unlock the secret to epic Bluetooth sound by learning the simple trick to pump up your speaker volume.

Section 1: Why are most Bluetooth speakers quiet?
Before we delve into the secret, it's important to understand why most Bluetooth speakers are quiet. One reason is that manufacturers try to maintain the battery life by limiting the output power of the built-in amplifier. Additionally, Bluetooth speakers generally have a relatively small form factor, which makes it difficult to integrate larger speakers and amplifiers that can produce louder sound. Finally, some speakers are built for a specific purpose, such as outdoor use, and reducing the volume helps to conserve energy.

Section 2: The Secret Trick to Pump Up Your Speaker Volume
While there are several methods of increasing speaker volume, the easiest and most effective method is by using an equalizer app. Equalizer apps allow you to change various settings on your smartphone or tablet, such as bass, treble, and mid-range frequencies. Most Bluetooth speakers have a limited range of frequencies, and equalizer apps can help regulate these frequencies to produce crystal-clear sound with enhanced volume.

Section 3: Apps that Work Wonder with Bluetooth Speakers
Here are some apps that have been tested and found to produce excellent results with Bluetooth speakers:

1. Boom: This equalizer app comes highly recommended for all music lovers using Bluetooth speakers. It allows you to adjust the music settings to align with your preference.

2. Bass Booster: This app does exactly what its name suggests. It boosts the bass without distorting the sound quality. It's a preferred app for those who love deep and punchy bass.

3. Equalizer FX: This app provides several presets that can be selected based on the type of music being played, such as rock, metal, or electronic. It's a simple app that produces significant results, and it works perfectly with Bluetooth speakers.

Section 4: Conclusion
Don’t let the limited volume of your Bluetooth speaker limit your music listening experience. Try using an equalizer app to adjust the sound settings and significantly increase the volume of your speaker. The above apps are great options, but there are many other apps available on the App Store and Google Play Store. With just a few clicks, you can unlock the secret to epic Bluetooth sound and enjoy your favorite tunes with maximum volume and clarity.

This article explains several methods to make smaller Bluetooth speakers louder and enjoy your music with a boost. 

 
##   Consider the Effect of Room Size on Sound Quality  
 

Bluetooth speakers are portable devices. That small size gives them lesser powers of amplification than their bigger cousins.

 
### 
Note:
 
Every speaker has a limit to the maximum volume it can throw out. You cannot make it louder. So, use the methods outlined here to funnel the speakers' sound energy and make it appear louder to your ears. 
 

Sound is a form of energy, and it follows the inverse square law, which states the intensity of sound decreases by approximately six decibels for each doubling of distance from the sound source. The effect is the opposite when you bring the source of sound closer.

 

A Bluetooth speaker in a larger room or an open space will sound different from a speaker in a tiny room. Sound dissipates with distance, so the quality of sound will depend on the room's size and other variables like the material of the walls and floors. 

 

Avoid using a lesser-powered Bluetooth speaker in a large room or open spaces. There are Bluetooth performance speakers like Soundboks and the Bose S1 Pro suited for outdoor parties. Yours may not be one of them. 

 
##   Place the Bluetooth Speaker at the Right Spot  
 

The room size also determines the precise spot for placement. Check for obstructions like a chair or a vase between the speaker and the listeners. Speakers have three fundamental sound drivers: tweeters, midrange drivers, and woofers.

 

Obstructions don’t affect woofers and subwoofers as lower frequencies are omnidirectional and can bend around objects in the room. Higher frequency sounds from tweeters are directional and work best when pointed towards your ears. Any obstacle hampers the full range of sound and your acoustic experience. Follow these two thumb rules:

 
- Don’t place the speakers directly on the floor as the surface can attenuate the signals. For instance, a carpeted floor can absorb sounds. Speakers sound best across all frequency ranges when they are closer to the level of the ears. Don’t place them too close to the walls. Low-frequency sounds (bass) from woofers reflect from walls and interfere with the speaker's direct sounds. You can reduce this acoustic interference by placing it away from walls.

 

Experiment with different locations by moving the speaker around in small increments while listening to the same song. Play it by ear to get the perfect spot where your Bluetooth speaker sounds the loudest. 

 
##   Double-Check All Audio Settings  
 

Set up the Bluetooth speakers with the optimum volume that does not cause any distortions. If your phone is the source of the audio, then check its volume setting too.

 

Sources like VLC Player and iTunes come with equalizer settings. Choose the suitable equalizer preset (there are more than 20 presets in iTunes) and see if they help improve overall sound quality. 

 

Signal dropping is a common problem in Bluetooth speakers. Place the source like your phone or computer close to the Bluetooth speaker to prevent a poor signal.

 
##   Connect to Multiple Bluetooth Speakers  
 

Many Bluetooth speakers today come with Wi-Fi support. You can pair Bluetooth speakers for a bigger sound. For instance, two Apple HomePods can be set up together in the same room. The PartyBoost feature in some JBL speakers allows you to connect multiple PartyBoost-compatible speakers over Bluetooth rather than Wi-Fi. 

 
### 
Tip:
 
Software amplification apps for laptops and phones can also help to increase the perceived loudness. Tweak their settings, and you can also correct for sound distortion. Try a few speaker booster apps to see if they help with your Bluetooth speakers' perceived loudness.
 
- What is the best Bluetooth speaker?
 - Lifewire recommends the Bose Home Speaker 500 as the overall best Bluetooth speaker in 2021. People looking for the best battery life for their money should consider the Anker Soundcore 2, while more budget-conscious shoppers should check out the JBL Clip 3.
 - How do you connect a Bluetooth speaker to a Roku TV?
 - There's no direct way to pair Bluetooth speakers to a Roku TV, so you need to use a workaround. You can use the Roku app on a mobile device to pair the speakers and the TV. In this case, your smartphone or tablet acts as a sort of "connector" between the two.
 - How do you connect a Bluetooth speaker to a computer?
 - You can connect a Bluetooth speaker to a Windows 10 PC by going to Settings > Devices > Bluetooth & Other devices > Add Bluetooth or other device > Bluetooth and selecting your speaker from the list of available devices. If it doesn't pair, make sure the speaker is turned on and that it's not already connected to another device.
 - How do you reset a Bluetooth speaker?
 - Generally, you can reset a Bluetooth speaker by first unpairing it, then pressing a combination of buttons. Usually, it's the power button, Bluetooth button, and/or a volume button, depending on the model speaker you're using. Some speakers also have a pinhole button you can use to reset them.
