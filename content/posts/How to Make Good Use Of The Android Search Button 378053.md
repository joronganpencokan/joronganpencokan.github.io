# Unlock The Secret Power Of Your Android Search Button: Increase Productivity In Seconds! 

As an Android user, you might have noticed the search button on your device, which is placed at the bottom of your screen or on your keypad. It looks like a magnifying glass, and you probably use it to search the web or your device for specific content. But did you know that the search button has more secrets that can help you increase productivity within seconds?

In this article, we will explore the different ways you can unlock the power of the search button, and how you can use it to get quick access to information, apps, and settings on your Android device. 

## Search Within Apps 

If you frequently use certain apps on your device to find information, articles, or messages, you can save time by using the search button to look for specific content within those apps. For example, if you are using the Google Docs app and want to find a particular document, tap on the search button, and type the name of the document you need. The search will show you all documents with that name inside the Google Docs app. You can do the same with other apps, such as Gmail or Evernote.

## Search The Web 

Of course, you can use the search button to search the web just as you would on your browser. However, what you might not know is that you can launch a Google search or a Google Voice search, by long-pressing the search button. This feature is handy when you need to find information quickly or do not have your hands-free to type.

## Search For Settings 

Tired of scrolling through all the settings menus to find the one you need? The search button can help with that too. Simply tap on the search button, and type the setting you wish to change, such as "brightness," "volume," or "Wi-Fi." The search will show you the specific setting you need to access, which you can then change.

## Launch Apps 

You can also use the search button to launch the apps on your device. Instead of swiping through all the apps in your app drawer or on your home screen, you can launch them by typing their name into the search bar. For example, if you want to launch the YouTube app, tap on the search button, and type "YouTube." The search will show you the app, which you can tap on to quickly launch.

## Conclusion 

The search button on your Android device is a hidden gem that can help you increase productivity within seconds. With its multiple functions, you can search within apps, search the web, search for settings, and launch apps with ease. These features not only save you time but also make your Android experience more efficient and convenient.

So, the next time you need to find information, launch an app or change a setting on your device, remember to tap on the search button, and unlock the secret power of your Android search button.

Are you one of those people who is constantly doing something on your Android phone? If you are anything like I am, you likely use the search function a  fair amount. Once you start to use the Android search feature, you can  find and navigate to things with less hassle.
 
One  of the most powerful buttons on an android phone is the search button. You know, the magnifying glass button. If you aren’t using it regularly, perhaps you don’t know what pressing this one button can do for you.
 
Here are a few tweaks to help you give the Android search button even more power.
 
## In the settings
 
I  know a lot of people don’t go poking around in the settings if they  don’t have to. One tip for better searching on Android involves adding  some choices to your search.
 
Press the Android search button and look for the Google icon at the top. This is where you can change how the Android search acts. You can search a  bunch of different applications. When you install applications to your  Android device, you cannot search these apps by default. You need to go into the settings and allow them to be searched.
 
To add new applications to the Android search screen, you need to:
 
- Press the search button.
 - Press the menu button.
 - Select search settings.
 - Select searchable items.
 - Check all of the boxes for the apps you want to search within.

 

 
Now  when you go back into the search screen by pressing the magnifying  glass (search button). When you press the Google logo next to the search  bar, you will see the apps you selected available to search now.
 
### LaunchKey
 
LaunchKey is another application to add even more function to the Android search  button. By long pressing the Android search button, you can choose 9 application or system shortcuts.
 
Download  LaunchKey APK. After you install and run it for the first  time, you will need to do a little configuring. I chose the custom menu option.
 
From  there you will need to long press the Android search button. When you do, you will be asked to choose the default action. Check the box Use by default for this action then select LaunchKey.
 
Choose what applications or system functions you’d like to have access to by following the onscreen instructions.
 
## Conclusion
 
The  more you can access with fewer clicks, swipes or typing, the more productive you will be using your Android phone. The trick is to keep it simple enough where you do not need to radically change the way you search. Most people struggle when they need to learn a whole new system.
 
The addition of Searchify and LaunchKey will let you keep doing what you are doing, but adds a few useful features.
