You may also want to revoke access for any apps or devices you don’t recognize or don’t need access to your account.

Step 5: Take Advantages of Additional Security Features

Google offers additional security features to keep your account safe. These include two-factor authentication, which adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring a code sent to your phone or email when signing in from a new device. You can also set up an alert in case there’s any suspicious activity on your account.

In conclusion, running a security checkup on your Google account is essential to keep your information safe. By following these steps, you can ensure that your account settings are up-to-date and that you’re taking advantage of all the additional security features that Google offers.
