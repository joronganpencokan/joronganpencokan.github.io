In the past few days, the rumor was spreading that we could return to Vice City in GTA 6. It is now clear, however, that we can safely ignore these rumors.
 
We now know that GTA 6 has been under development by the developers at Rockstar Games for quite a while. Since the studio has so far not been carried away to give specific details about the next title of the successful open-world series, rumors and speculations were of course open to the door. In the past few days, the rumor mill has reported that our way in GTA 6 or GTA 6 Online could lead again to the metropolis of Vice City. But what about the rumors?
 
The current rumors about GTA 6 and GTA 6 Online originated in the domain called gtavicecityonline.com, which users claim to have come across a few days ago. Could it be a specific reference to the setting of the next GTA adventure? Unfortunately not. The domain in question was by no means registered just a few days ago. Instead, the domain entry dates from 2009 and is, therefore, more than ten years old.
 
We are therefore likely to be dealing with a typical domain protection that the people in charge at Rockstar Games have done over and over again in recent years. This does not rule out Vice City as a possible setting for GTA 6 or GTA Online, but there can be no question of a possible confirmation of the location.
 
And if that was not enough, it is still not yet known when the official reveal of Grand Theft Auto 6 is to be expected. We may have to be patient for a while, because in the months after the official launch of the two next-generation consoles, Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, GTA 5 and GTA 5 Online are initially on the way to release on the new generation consoles.
 
This could indicate that Rockstar Games is not in a hurry to release GTA 6. The only thing that is certain is that the upcoming title of the popular open-world series will only be released for the two next-generation consoles.
 
Should those responsible at Rockstar Games decide to give specific details about GTA 6, we will of course bring you up to date news on it immediately, only on GamerTweak.com.
