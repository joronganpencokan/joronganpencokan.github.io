# Unleash Your Excel Skills With These Amazing Comment Tricks - Learn How To Insert, Edit, and Delete Comments Like a Pro!

Microsoft Excel is one of the most popular spreadsheet applications used in offices and homes worldwide. It is powerful and versatile, capable of handling large data sets and performing complex calculations with ease. However, many users only scratch the surface of its capabilities, unaware of the many advanced features available to them. One such feature is comments, which can be used to document and explain cells, formulas, and functions. In this article, we will explore some amazing comment tricks that will help you unleash your Excel skills.

## Insert Comments

Comments in Excel are text boxes that can be attached to cells to provide additional information. They are typically used to explain the purpose, source, or nature of a formula or function. To insert a comment, follow these steps:

1. Select the cell you want to attach the comment to.
2. Click the "Review" tab in the ribbon.
3. Click "New Comment" in the "Comments" group.
4. Type your comment in the text box that appears.

You can also insert comments by right-clicking a cell and selecting "Insert Comment" from the context menu. Once you have inserted a comment, it will be displayed as a small red triangle in the upper-right corner of the cell.

## Edit Comments

After you have inserted a comment, you may want to edit it to correct errors or provide additional information. To edit a comment, follow these steps:

1. Select the cell containing the comment.
2. Hover the mouse over the comment until the text box appears.
3. Click inside the text box to activate it.
4. Make the required changes to the text.
5. Click outside the text box to deactivate it.

You can also edit comments by right-clicking a cell and selecting "Edit Comment" from the context menu.

If you no longer need a comment, you can delete it using the following steps:

1. Select the cell containing the comment.
2. Click the "Review" tab in the ribbon.
3. Click "Delete" in the "Comments" group.
4. Select "Delete Comment" from the drop-down menu.

You can also delete comments by right-clicking a cell and selecting "Delete Comment" from the context menu.

## Format Comments

Excel provides several options to format comments for better visibility and clarity. To format a comment, follow these steps:

1. Select the cell containing the comment.
2. Hover the mouse over the comment until the text box appears.
3. Right-click inside the text box and select "Format Comment" from the context menu.
4. Choose the desired formatting options, such as font, color, border, and fill.

1. Click "File" in the ribbon.
2. Select "Options" from the drop-down menu.
3. Click "Advanced" in the left pane.
4. Scroll down to the "Display options for this workbook" section.

When you share an Excel spreadsheet with other people, questions or concerns about its content can come up occasionally. Instead of sending emails, just add a comment for others to see. 

 

Anyone using the spreadsheet can respond to a comment or even delete it. All comments are marked with the user’s name, dated, and time-stamped. Comments differ from Excel notes, which are similar to placing a yellow sticky note into the file. Other users cannot respond to a note in Excel but they can carry on small conversations using comments.

 

The instructions below focus on the easiest ways to add, edit, and delete comments in Windows or on a Mac; scroll to the bottom of this article for Excel for Android instructions.

 
##   Inserting, Editing, or Deleting a Comment in Excel for Windows or macOS  
 
###   How to Add a Comment  
 

The easiest way to create a comment that others can respond to is follow these steps: 

 
This information in this article applies to Excel 2019, 2016, Excel for Mac, Excel for Android, and Excel 365.
 
- In an open spreadsheet, right-click the cell where you want to make the comment.
 - Click New Comment in the menu pane.
 - In Start a conversation, type the comment you’d like to make.
 - Click the green arrow to post your comment.
 - To exit the comment, click anywhere on the spreadsheet.

 

You probably noticed that once you clicked the green arrow, the comment automatically showed a Reply box. That’s where other readers can respond to the comment. They simply type in their reply and click the green arrow that appears to post their response back to you. This back-and-forth response through comments is called a Reply Thread. 

 

In an open spreadsheet, right-click the cell where you want to make the comment.

 

Click New Comment in the menu pane.

 

In Start a conversation, type the comment you’d like to make.

 

Click the green arrow to post your comment.

 

To exit the comment, click anywhere on the spreadsheet. 

 

In some versions of Excel, including Excel 2016, you can also use the Ribbon to leave a comment. Just click the cell where you want to leave a comment, click Review on the Ribbon, and then click New Comment or Insert Comment.

 
###   How to Reply to a Comment  
 

To reply to a comment someone else has left for you, you can either click on the cell and enter a reply immediately into the Reply box or you can right-click the cell where the comment is located and use the Reply box from there.

 
In the Web version of Excel, you can flag a comment for a specific reader by typing the @ symbol followed by the user’s name. Sometimes a drop-down list of users is also available in this version.
 
###   How to Edit a Comment   
 

You can add more comments to a thread you started or you can edit a comment you already posted. To edit a comment you have made, follow these steps: 

 
Any cell with a comment attached to it is marked with a small, colored mark in the upper right corner. The color will vary depending upon your specific Excel setup.
 
- Click the cell which has the comment.
 - Move your mouse over the comment and you’ll see the Edit option appear.
 - Click Edit.
 - Type the changes you need to make.
 - Click Save.

 

If you decide midway through your change that your edit isn’t necessary, just click Cancel. 

 

Click the cell which has the comment.

 

Move your mouse over the comment and you’ll see the Edit option appear.

 

Click Edit. 

 

Type the changes you need to make. 

 

Click Save.

 
###   How to Delete a Comment   
 

Anyone can delete a comment in a spreadsheet, not just the person who started the comment thread. When a comment is no longer needed, right-click the cell where it is located and click Delete Comment from the menu.

 
###   How to Show Or Hide All Comments  
 

There are additional ways you can post and respond to comments in Excel. The Ribbon offers an entire Review section that allows you to open up a Comments pane to the right of the spreadsheet. You can easily bounce from comment to comment using this section of the Ribbon or add and delete comments. (Just be sure you have selected the correct cell before you use any of the Ribbon commands.) 

 

The Review tab also allows you to show or hide comments. To see all the comments in a spreadsheet, go to Review > Show Comments. To hide all the comments, use the same instructions and the comments will all disappear. The purple marks in commented cells, however, will always appear.
