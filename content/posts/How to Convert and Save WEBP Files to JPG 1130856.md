Webp is a file extension developed by Google. It is a format that is of superior quality and smaller in size. Google developed this new image format to reduce the size of the image without needing to sacrifice image quality. Recently, a lot of websites are making use of the Webp image format. 
 
The problem with it is that it won’t open in a normal image viewer – for instance, Adobe Photoshop or the Windows 10 Photos app. The solution to this is converting this Webp image to JPG. This article will show you some of the best tools to convert and save Webp files to JPG.
 
## 1. Google’s WEBP Photoshop Plugin
 
Before moving onto online solutions and third-party tools, wouldn’t it be great if you could open Webp files directly through Photoshop? Well, some Google developers with a bit of time on their hands made this a reality. Yes, that means you can open Webp files directly through Photoshop, and convert them there (note that this will only work on the recent Photoshop versions).
 
- First, download the binary (WebPShop.8bi) from Github.

 
- Next, move the file over to your Photoshop plugins directory (default: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2022\Plug-ins\). You may get a message saying you require administrative permission. Just click “Continue” if that comes up.

 
- Restart Photoshop if it’s open, and you’ll be able to open WEBP files just like any other image format. To save it as a JPG, go to “File -> Save for Web (or Save As)”, then select the JPG format from there.

 
## 2. iLoveIMG
 
iLoveIMG is my favorite as it has the ability to convert almost any image format into JPG, be it PNG, GIF, TIF, PSD, SVG, WEBP, or RAW. Simply upload the source image and hit the “Convert to JPG” button. 
 
The iLoveIMG website has a clean user interface. It allows the user to upload images via Google Drive or DropBox and converts them for free. Moreover, the website also allows unlimited batch conversions, and you can add watermarks to the images for promotion.
 
## 3. FreeConvert
