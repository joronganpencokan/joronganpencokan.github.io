Title: Unlock the Secret to Stunning 360-Degree Camera Shots on ANY Android Device with this Easy Hack!

Are you tired of substandard shots from your Android device's camera, especially when it comes to 360-degree shots? Are you frustrated about the inability to capture the whole scenery or background of your pictures? You don't have to fret anymore because we have uncovered an excellent hack that will turn your Android device into a revolutionary 360-degree camera.

What You Need

You don't have to break the bank to create stunning 360-degree shots on your Android device. All you need is to download a FREE app available on Google Playstore called the "Panorama360." You will find that the app's features are top-notch, compared to what other paid apps are offering. It provides a wide-angle view and a clear image quality.

Here is How to Do It

Firstly, you insert your Android device's camera lens into the provided memory grooves to create a seamless 360-degree panoramic view. After that, you navigate your device's settings to activate the app's camera and align your device's viewport with the current background.

Next, you rotate your device in a clockwise order while maintaining a single angle. The app will take multiple shots at different angles and stitch them together, forming a panoramic view that appears smooth and clear. Once the app completes your 360-degree panorama shot, simply save your picture to your device's memory gallery.

Additional Tips

There are a few extra things you can do to enhance your panoramic pictures. You can start by using a tripod or any level surface to rest your device, ensuring minimum movement. This ensures that your 360-degree shot is not crooked or distorted. Also, try to maintain good lighting conditions, as panoramic shots tend to be more sensitive to light.

Conclusion

With this simple and easy-to-understand hack, you can improve your Android device's camera capacity, creating stunning and mesmerizing 360-degree panoramic shots in no time. All thanks to Panorama360, a free and readily available app on Google's Playstore. It has never been this easy to create an entire 360-degree image of your favorite scenery, a family gathering, or any other panoramic view you desire. So why not try it out today and unlock the secret to stunning 360-degree camera shots on ANY Android device.

[dropcap color=‚Äù#111111‚Ä≥ font=‚Äùarial‚Äù]M[/dropcap]ost android enthusiasts know that the camera in the latest Android OS 4.2.2 Jellybean, has a very cool user interface and packs awesome features such as panorama and 360 degree photosphere. If you are stuck with older versions such as Froyo, Gingerbread or 4.1.2 Jellybean your stock camera won‚Äôt have those features or the new UI. However, if you have rooted your android, you can now enjoy the 4.2.2 camera on your android device,¬†provided it packs sufficient processing power. We recommend at least a dual core device for smooth operation. I flashed this camera on a Galaxy S- All functions worked well but the photo stitching in photoshere was very slow. The 4.2.2 camera is guaranteed to run great on any dual core or quad core android smartphone or tablets.
 
## Here are the steps to flash or install Android 4.2.2 camera with photosphere
 
Note: Recommended your ROM is based on ICS or above¬† ( CyanogenmodM 9 or above):
 
- Download the camera zip file¬†here
 - Now place this zip file in your internal storage on root directory. (Note:Before flashing rename Gallery2.apk to Gallery2.apk.bak .You will find the Gallery2.apk or simply Gallery.apk in your internal storage- system/app.)
 - Now reboot in clockworkmod recovery
 - Install Zip from SDcard >> Select the Zip file and then select YES to confirm install
 - Reboot System

 
There you go. Now you have the latest android camera in your device. Enjoy its cool features.

 - Hi GUrwinder,
 - The previous post had errors about the zip file and now it is corrected.
 - Instructions:
 - You will find a file ‚Äú‚ÄùGallery2.apk‚Äù in your internal storage- sdcard/app directory. Simply re=name it to Gallery2.apk.bak. Now, flash the zip file.
 - Also, if you have titanium backup, you can use it to uninstall ‚ÄúGallery‚Äù from your apps list. Then you can flash the zip file.
 - If nothing works, you can simply flash the zip file but you will have two cameras (the old as well as new).
 - I hope it works now. All the best. üòÄ

Works great. Smooth and easy. Unfortunately for me, I like the original SII camera better. The good news is that with Titanium Backup, I can use the SII camera but keep the other one backed up in case I want to use Photosphere.
 
thanks,,, i wish it work ,, will see and review
 
It gave me another gallery but still no camera on my touchpad running cm10.1. I can get a camera from the play store but it disappears after rebooting and gives me a 3rd gallery. Lol, I‚Äôve got 3 galleries and no camera.
