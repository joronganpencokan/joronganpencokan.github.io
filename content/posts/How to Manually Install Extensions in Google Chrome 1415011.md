# Unlock Hidden Chrome Extension Power: Learn How to Manually Install Extensions with This Simple Guide!

If you're looking to unlock hidden extension power in Google Chrome, you're in the right place. One of the most significant advantages of using Google Chrome is the ability to use different extensions. These things help you to increase productivity, save time and effort while browsing, and make the overall experience more enjoyable. 

However, sometimes, you may come across extensions that aren't available on the Chrome Web Store, or your internet connection might be too slow to connect to it. In such cases, you might wonder if there is any other way to install extensions. Fortunately, there is. 

In this guide, we'll show you how to manually install chrome extension by following the simple steps given below.

## Step 1: Download Extension

The first step is to download the extension file, which has a ".crx" file extension. This file contains all the necessary code and configuration required to run the extension. 

You can download a Chrome extension file by visiting the Chrome Web Store, finding the extension of your interest, and clicking the "Add to Chrome" button. Instead of actually adding the extension to your Chrome browser, it will download the .crx file to your computer. 

## Step 2: Locate the downloaded file

The second step is to locate the downloaded file. If you've changed your default download location, you'll have to check that location. By default, Chrome downloads files to the Downloads folder on your computer. 

Once you've located the file, you need to drag and drop it into Chrome. You can do this by opening the extensions page by typing "chrome://extensions/" in the address bar of your Chrome browser or by clicking the three-dot menu on the upper right corner and selecting "More tools" and "Extensions."

## Step 3: Install the Extension

After dragging and dropping the downloaded file into your Chrome browser, you'll be prompted to install the extension. Once you click "Add Extension," the extension will be installed and ready to use. 

One of the most significant benefits of manually installing chrome extensions is that it bypasses the restrictions of the Chrome Web Store, which means you can use extensions that aren't available on it. For instance, some extensions such as Music Streamer or AdGuard, which are apt for music lovers or those who hate ads, respectively, aren't available on the Chrome Web Store. 

## Conclusion

Manually installing extensions is a simple process that will change your browsing experience for the better. By following the steps above, you can download, install and use extensions that aren't available on the Chrome Web Store. You can use this method to unlock hidden extension power and achieve more productivity, efficiency, and enjoyment while browsing the web. 

Unlock hidden Chrome extension power today! Start by downloading your favorite extension and following these simple steps to install it manually.

Google Chrome has been blessed with a number of extensions that help expand the capabilities of one of the most used web browsers in the world. If you have taken a look at the Chrome Store, you know that there is an extension for almost anything you want to do with your browser. From download managers to DLNA controllers, Chrome has everything for you. Despite this, some useful extensions have not been able to make it to the store, and hence cannot be used by users like you and me. But wait, there is now a way for you to install extensions available outside the store in Chrome. Here’s how:
 
Note:  Some extensions are not available in the Chrome store for security reasons. Before you bypass the Chrome store and install an extension manually, make sure that the extension you are installing is free of virus/malware.
 
In the example below, I will be installing an extension called “Google Stars” that is NOT available in the Chrome store. The procedure is the same for any extension you wish to install. All you need to have is the .crx file of the extension.
 
## Manually Installing an Extension in Chrome
 
1. Download the extension (.crx file) you want to install on your computer. Click on “Continue” when Chrome prompts you. It will then be downloaded to your computer.
 

 
2. Click on the three lines shown on the top-right corner in your browser, which will open a menu for you. Click on “Settings.” You will be redirected to your browser’s settings page.
 
3. Once on the Settings page, click on the “Extensions” link given in the left-hand side of your screen. It will take you to the extensions page that shows all the extensions you have installed in your browser.
 
4. On the extensions page, you should see a checkbox on the top saying “Developer mode.” Click on it.
 
5. Drag the .crx file and drop it onto the extensions page.
 
6. Once you have dropped the file, it will ask if you want to add the extension to your browser. Click on “Add” to manually install the extension.
 
7. When Chrome has finished installing the extension, you will see something like the following. It indicates the extension was successfully installed.
 
That’s it.
 
You have successfully sideloaded an extension in your Chrome that was unavailable in the official Chrome store. This way, you can add as many extensions in your Chrome as you want; just make sure you know what you are going to install so as to avoid any issues down the road.
 
## Conclusion
 
Having the ability to manually install an extension lets you try out some of the extensions that are either in testing mode or have not been able to make their way to the official store, obviously for some reasons known only by the developer.
