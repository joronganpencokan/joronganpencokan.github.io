# Unleash Epic Destruction Like a Viking God: Learn How to Craft the Ultimate Valheim Crystal Battleaxe with Crystal Shards!

Valheim is a popular survival game that is inspired by Viking mythology. The game tells a story of a Viking warrior who is sent to Valheim, a mythical world, to defeat the enemies of the gods. To accomplish this mission, the player needs to craft various weapons and armor, including the ultimate Valheim Crystal Battleaxe with crystal shards.

Crafting the Valheim Crystal Battleaxe is no easy feat, but with the right tools and knowledge, you can unleash epic destruction like a Viking God. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to craft the ultimate Valheim Crystal Battleaxe with crystal shards:

## Step 1: Gather the Materials

Before you can even think about crafting the Valheim Crystal Battleaxe, you need to gather the necessary materials. You will need:

- 20x Fine Wood
- 5x Crystal Shards
- 3x Ancient Bark
- 2x Deer Hide

Fine Wood can be found by chopping birch and oak trees in the game. Crystal Shards are a rare resource that can be found in the Mountains biome. Ancient Bark can be found by chopping down Ancient Trees in the Swamp biome, and Deer Hide can be obtained by hunting deer in the game.

## Step 2: Find a Forge

Once you have gathered all the necessary materials, you need to find a forge. Forges can be found in Black Forests or by building one yourself. To build a forge, you need a workbench, 20x Stone, and 5x Surtling Cores.

## Step 3: Craft the Battleaxe

With the materials gathered and the forge found, you can now craft the Valheim Crystal Battleaxe. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open your inventory

5. Click on Craft

The Valheim Crystal Battleaxe takes 20 seconds to craft, and once it's done, you'll have one of the most powerful weapons in the game.

## Step 4: Upgrade the Battleaxe

Making the battleaxe is only half the battle. To get the most out of it, you need to upgrade it. To upgrade the battleaxe, you need to find a Grindstone. Grindstones can be found in Black Forests or crafted using 15x Stone and 5x Iron. 

Once you have a grindstone, follow these steps to upgrade the Valheim Crystal Battleaxe:

1. Approach the grindstone and open it
2. Put the Valheim Crystal Battleaxe in the grindstone
3. Use the grindstone to sharpen the battleaxe
4. Repeat the process until the battleaxe is fully upgraded

## Step 5: Unleash Epic Destruction

With your newly crafted and upgraded Valheim Crystal Battleaxe, it's time to unleash epic destruction like a Viking God. The battleaxe can do massive damage to enemies, including those made of rock and ice. The crystal shards also give the battleaxe an icy effect, making it a deadly tool for both close and long-range combat.
