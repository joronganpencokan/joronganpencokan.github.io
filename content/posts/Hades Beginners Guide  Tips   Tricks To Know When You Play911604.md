# Unleash the Power of the Underworld: Insider Hades Tips and Tricks for Beginner Players!

Hades, the Greek god of the underworld, is one of the most powerful and feared gods of all time. In the world of video games, he is the protagonist of Supergiant Games' critically acclaimed game, Hades. As a beginner player, it can be challenging to navigate the fast-paced gameplay and complex mechanics of Hades.

However, fear not, beginner players! This article will uncover insider tips and tricks to help you unleash the power of the underworld and become a formidable opponent.

## Tip #1: Choose Your Boons Wisely

As you progress through Hades, you will encounter various gods who will offer you boons - powerful abilities that can help you in your quest. Each god's boons have unique effects and synergies, so it is important to choose wisely.

One tip is to focus on building a specific "build" for your character. For example, if you want to focus on dealing damage with your attacks, you can choose boons from gods like Ares or Athena. If you prefer a defensive playstyle, you can choose boons from gods like Zeus or Poseidon. Experiment with different combinations and find what works best for you.

## Tip #2: Don't be Afraid to Die

In Hades, dying is not the end. Every time you die, you are sent back to the beginning of the underworld, but you retain all the boons and upgrades you have acquired. This means that every run is an opportunity to try out new strategies and improve your skills.

So, don't be afraid to die. Embrace death as a learning opportunity, and use each run to hone your skills.

## Tip #3: Maximize Your Resources

Hades is a game that requires resource management. You need to collect currency, like darkness and gems, to upgrade your abilities and weapons. You also need to choose the right companions, called "summons," to assist you in battle.

To maximize your resources, make sure to explore every nook and cranny of the underworld. Break every vase, open every chest, and interact with every character you meet. Also, pay attention to the rewards offered in each run, and prioritize collecting the resources that will help you progress the most.

## Tip #4: Learn from Your Enemies

In Hades, your enemies are not just obstacles to overcome; they are also teachers. Each enemy has unique patterns and tells that you can learn to predict and react to.

For example, the gorgon enemies have a charging attack that you can dodge by moving out of the way at the right time. The skeletons have a shield that you can break by attacking them from behind. Study each enemy and their tells, and use that knowledge to your advantage.

## Tip #5: Have Fun!

At the end of the day, Hades is a game. It is meant to be enjoyed and experienced. So, don't take it too seriously, and have fun with it. Try out new strategies, experiment with different boons, and enjoy the beautiful art and music.

In Conclusion

Hades is a game that offers a deep and rewarding experience for beginners and experienced players alike. By following these insider tips and tricks, you can unleash the power of the underworld and become a force to be reckoned with. So, grab your weapons, embrace death, and let's explore the depths of the underworld together!

## Hades Beginners Guide: Tips & Tricks
 

 
### Distribute your Nectar – Hades Beginners Guide
 
Nectar is one of the many random items you will chance upon when you play Hades. You can consider this item to be of importance when it comes to gifting the non-playable characters of the game. Distributing your Nectar to characters like Cerberus and Nyx can help strengthen your relationship with them.
 
If you give Nectar to a non-playable character for the first time, you will receive a Keepsake from them. You can use these tokens of appreciation to receive bonus gold, health, or even damage under specific conditions. This makes distributing Nectar quite important. Because of this, Nectar finds an important place in this Hades beginners guide.
 
### Save some Nectar for Sisyphus, Eurydice, Thanotos, and Patroclus
 
While giving away your Nectar is a wise thing to do, we recommend you to at least hold onto one of them until you receive all of the Keepsakes. The reason we advise you to do this is because of the potential to bump into characters like Sisyphus, Eurydice, Thanotos, and Patroclus. They can be rare to spot, and can often only appear once in 3-4 runs.
 
Because of this, you should keep at least one Nectar with you at all times. In case you do bump into one of these rare characters, you will be able to offer them some Nectar.
 
You will be able to find Patroclus in Elysium, Eurydice in Asphodel, Thanatos in Elysium, and Sisyphus in Tartarus.
 
### Speak to Everyone – Hades Beginners Guide
 
Hades has a huge focus on the storyline and its narrative. This makes the player constantly engage in the game’s compelling storyline. To get some interesting items in the game, you will need to build and maintain cordial relations with the characters.
 
While you can do so with Nectar, talking also plays a huge role in how well you do in the game. You can identify characters you need to speak to because of the exclamation marks over their heads.
 
### Keep Switching Keepsakes in Hades
 
The Keepsake Collection is an important upgrade that you can acquire early in the game. To do so, you will need to spend Gems at the House of Hades Contractors.
 
We recommend you to keep swapping and changing your Keepsakes because most of them only have one specific use. For example, the Lucky Tooth or the Chthonic Coin Purse. You will be able to swap these Keepsakes after each boss.
 
Swapping can also help improve the quality of your Keepsakes, as you will find them improving with each encounter you complete while wearing them.
 
### Pick the Dark Weapon
 
Before you make a run when playing Hades, you will find a weapon in the armory that has a purple hue around it. This means that you will acquire bonus Darkness if you use it in the next run. Skelly will also explain the same to you during a conversation.
 
Using Dark Weapons will help you significantly boost your currency. Additionally, it is a great way to experiment with the Boons and Weapons in the game.
 
### Focus on Experimentation, Not Winning
 
If you place your focus on acquiring keys for their abilities and weapons at the beginning of the game instead of purely winning, you will find yourself enjoying a lot more. This is because, towards the start of the game, you will not be too familiar with its mechanics.
 
Spending time on experimenting with weapons and boons will be much more exciting and engaging.
 
### Spend Time & Focus on Keys
 
At the start of Hades, we recommend you spend some time focusing on Keys. They resemble their real life counterparts, and are used to unlock new weapons in the House of Hades. You can also pick up new skills from the Mirror of Night.
 
Because of this, it is important you do not miss picking up keys whenever you find them on your runs.
 
### Set a Goal
 
Before you head into another run when playing Hades, set a goal for yourself. The aim depends entirely on what you want from your run. According to your needs, you can adjust these goals.
 
Setting goals will help you get the best out of the game without wasting any time.
 
So there you have it. This was our beginners guide to playing Hades. With the help of these tips and tricks, you will be able to definitely enjoy this thrilling and rewarding game. Even if you do not kill the bosses in your first run, do not worry. You can always keep trying until you master the game.
