Unlock The Secret To Mastering Excel: Learn How To Limit Rows And Columns In Minutes!

If you're someone who uses Microsoft Excel regularly, then you know how frustrating it can be to scroll through hundreds or even thousands of rows and columns to find the data you need. It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or an expert, navigating through all that data can be time-consuming and downright exasperating. Thankfully, there's a simple solution that can help you cut down on the time and headache involved in finding the information you require.

Limiting rows and columns in Excel can be done quickly and easily, and it is an essential skill to master when working with sizeable datasets. In this article, we'll take a look at how you can limit rows and columns in Excel in just a few minutes, making the process a breeze.

The first step in limiting rows and columns is to decide which range of cells you want to work with. You can do this by highlighting the cells you want to limit manually or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+A to select all cells in the worksheet. Once you've selected the cells you want to limit, head to the "Format" option under the "Home" tab of the Excel ribbon.

Next, click on "Hide & Unhide" and select "Hide Rows" or "Hide Columns," depending on whether you want to limit rows or columns. Selecting either of these options will hide the corresponding rows or columns from view, leaving only the rows and columns you want to work with.

The great thing about this method is that it is incredibly flexible. You can use it for one-time tasks or create a template that you can use repeatedly. For example, if you always work with a specific subset of data, you can hide the rows and columns that you don't need and save the spreadsheet as a template. Next time you use it, the rows and columns you hid previously will still be hidden, saving you extra time.

It's worth mentioning that limiting rows and columns in Excel will not delete any data. Instead, it hides it from view, making it easier to manage and navigate through your data more efficiently. If you want to revert to the original view that includes all rows and columns, you can use the "Unhide Rows" or "Unhide Columns" option, which is located under the same "Hide & Unhide" menu.

In conclusion, limiting rows and columns in Excel is a simple but effective way to boost your productivity while working with large sets of data. It enables you to focus on the data that matters while hiding irrelevant information from view. The next time you're working with Excel, try using this method and see how it can enhance your workflow!

To help control the size of an Excel worksheet, you can limit the number of columns and rows that a worksheet displays. In this guide, we show you how to hide (and unhide) rows and columns in Excel 2019, Excel 2016, Excel 2013, and Excel for Microsoft 365, as well as how to limit access to rows and columns using Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).

 
### 
What to Know
 
- To hide certain rows: Select or highlight the rows you want to hide. Right-click a row heading and choose Hide. Repeat for columns.To unhide: Right-click the header for the last visible row or column and choose Unhide.To temporarily limit range of cells: Right-click sheet tab > View Code > Properties. For ScrollArea, type A1:Z30. Save, close, and reopen Excel.

 
##   Hide Rows and Columns in Excel  
 

An alternative method for restricting the work area of a worksheet is to hide sections of unused rows and columns; they'll stay hidden even after you close the document. Follow the steps below to hide the rows and columns outside the range A1:Z30.

 
- Open your workbook and select the worksheet you want to hide rows and columns in. Click the header for row 31 to select the entire row.
 - Press and hold the Shift and Ctrl keys on the keyboard. At the same time, press the down arrow key on the keyboard to select all rows from row 31 to the bottom of the worksheet. Release all the keys.
 - Right-click one of the row headings to open the contextual menu. Select Hide.
 - The worksheet now shows only the data in rows 1 through 30.
 - Click the header for column AA and repeat steps 2 and 3 (using the right arrow key instead of the down arrow key) to hide all columns after column Z.
 - Save the workbook; the columns and rows outside the range A1 to Z30 will remain hidden until you unhide them.
 - You can use the same process to hide any rows or columns you want. Just select the header or headers for the row or column, right-click the header, and select Hide.

 
##   Unhide Rows and Columns in Excel  
 

When you want to view the data you hid, you can unhide the rows and columns at any time. Follow these steps to unhide the rows and columns you hid in the previous example.

 

Open your workbook and select the worksheet you want to hide rows and columns in. Click the header for row 31 to select the entire row.

 

Press and hold the Shift and Ctrl keys on the keyboard. At the same time, press the down arrow key on the keyboard to select all rows from row 31 to the bottom of the worksheet. Release all the keys.

 

Right-click one of the row headings to open the contextual menu. Select Hide.

 

The worksheet now shows only the data in rows 1 through 30.

 

Click the header for column AA and repeat steps 2 and 3 (using the right arrow key instead of the down arrow key) to hide all columns after column Z.

 

Save the workbook; the columns and rows outside the range A1 to Z30 will remain hidden until you unhide them.

 
You can use the same process to hide any rows or columns you want. Just select the header or headers for the row or column, right-click the header, and select Hide.
 
- Open the worksheet you used to hide row 31 and higher and column AA and higher. Click the headers for row 30 (or the last visible row in the worksheet) and the row below it. Right-click the row headers and, from the menu, select Unhide.
 - The hidden rows are restored.
 - Now click the headers for column Z (or the last visible column) and the column to the right of it. Right-click the selected column headers and, from the menu, choose Unhide. The hidden columns are restored.

 
##   Limit Access to Rows and Columns With VBA  
 

You can use Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to temporarily limit the range of usable rows and columns in a worksheet. In this example, you'll change the properties of a worksheet to limit the number of available rows to 30 and the number of columns to 26.

 

Open the worksheet you used to hide row 31 and higher and column AA and higher. Click the headers for row 30 (or the last visible row in the worksheet) and the row below it. Right-click the row headers and, from the menu, select Unhide.

 

The hidden rows are restored.

 

Now click the headers for column Z (or the last visible column) and the column to the right of it. Right-click the selected column headers and, from the menu, choose Unhide. The hidden columns are restored.

 
- Open a blank Excel file. At the bottom of the screen, right-click the Sheet1 sheet tab. From the menu, choose View Code.
 - The Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) editor window opens. In the left rail, locate the Properties section.
 - Under Properties,in the right column of the ScrollArea row, click the empty box and type A1:Z30.
 - Select File > Save and save your workbook as you normally would. Select File > Close and Return to Microsoft Excel.
 - To make sure your change is applied, perform this test. In your worksheet, try to scroll past row 30 or column Z. If the change has been applied, Excel bounces you back to the selected range and you're unable to edit cells outside that range.
 - To remove the restrictions, access VBA again and delete the ScrollArea range.

 
Changing the scroll area is a temporary measure; it resets each time the workbook is closed and reopened.

- What is the maximum limit of rows in Excel?
 - Microsoft says that the maximum size of a single Excel spreadsheet is 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns. The maximum row height is 409 points, and the maximum column width is 255 characters.
 - How do I permanently set row and column limits in Excel?
 - If you want to set a hard limit to columns or rows in an Excel spreadsheet (i.e. set it up so no additional rows or columns can be added past that set limit), unfortunately you can't. There's currently no menu option to prevent yourself or other users from adding more rows or columns you may not want. However, you can manually delete unwanted rows and columns by right-clicking the selected row(s) or column(s) and selecting Delete.
