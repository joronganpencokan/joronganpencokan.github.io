# Unleash Your Inner Spy: Learn How to Master Hitman 3's Camera Features for Picture Taking, Scanning, and Hacking!

Hitman 3 has revolutionized the world of gaming with its realistic spy-themed gameplay, which immerses players in an undercover world of espionage, assassination, and adventure. One of the game's standout features is the camera, which offers players the ability to take photos, scan items, and hack electronic devices.

In this article, we'll explore how to master Hitman 3's camera features and use them to become a master spy in the game world.

## Taking Pictures

The camera in Hitman 3 is an item that is always available to the player. It can be used to take pictures of any interesting items or locations in the game world. Taking pictures serves several purposes:

1. For the player's own record-keeping - taking pictures of targets, objectives, and challenges can help players keep track of their progress in the game.

2. For reconnaissance purposes - taking pictures of characters, items, or locations can help players gather information and plan their next move.

3. For completing challenges - some challenges require players to take pictures of specific items or characters.

To take a picture in Hitman 3, aim the camera at the desired object and press the "R1" button on PlayStation or "RB" on Xbox. This will take a picture that will be saved to the player's album in the game.

## Scanning Items

Another useful feature of the camera is its ability to scan items. Scanning allows players to gather important information about an item's properties, such as its weight, contents, or value. Scanning is a helpful tool for completing some challenges, such as "Evidence Collector."

To scan an item, aim the camera at the object and press the "L1" button on PlayStation or "LB" on Xbox. This will display information about the item on the player's screen. Some items cannot be scanned, including certain weapons or items that are too small or too far away.

## Hacking Devices

In addition to taking pictures and scanning items, the camera in Hitman 3 can also be used to hack electronic devices. These devices include computers, cameras, and keypads. Hacking allows players to gain access to restricted areas or information.

To hack a device, aim the camera at it and press the "Triangle" button on PlayStation or "Y" on Xbox. This will initiate the hacking process, which takes a few seconds to complete. If successful, the player will gain access to the device and its contents.

## Conclusion

Hitman 3's camera features allow players to immerse themselves in the role of a master spy, gathering information, taking pictures, and hacking devices. Learning how to use the camera effectively is essential for completing challenges, gathering intelligence, and making progress in the game's story.

So if you want to unleash your inner spy and become a master of Hitman 3's camera features, start practicing and exploring the game world today!

Ever since the beginning of the World of Assassination trilogy, IO Interactive has been putting a lot of effort into the Hitman series by adding maps of considerable size and well-detailed level designs, weapons, items, and equipment. The missions are like a giant puzzle you have to solve one by one by overcoming different obstacles in each level on every map. In this epic conclusion to the current Hitman trilogy, Agent 47 has new additions to his arsenal. A new pocket camera. Let’s look at how to use the camera to take pictures and more. This camera has features of entry-level handheld point & shoot camera like:
 
- 4x optical zoom
 - DOF settings option to adjust the depth of field
 - Three different camera filters

 
All these features give you the ability to take pictures of evidence, your targets, or even hack into computers and open electronic locks. You read that right! This is more than just a ‘point and shoot’ camera. It has some secret features up its sleeves, making it a vital & essential part of Agent 47’s default items for every mission. The new camera tool is one of the many features IO Interactive added to their latest installment in the series.
 
## How to Use Camera in Hitman 3 to Scan, Hack & Gather Intel
 
In your minimap, all interactable items will have a camera icon on them. These items can be either hacked like vents, windows & doors or scanned to gather intel for the mission. It feels futuristic, like something right out of Watch Dogs Franchise. The new camera will be an integral item as part of every mission in the game.
 
The camera comes into action from the first mission in Dubai, On Top Of The World. You can open shut windows to open up new pathways, take pictures of evidence and kills, like in Dubai where you have to kill a suspicious journalist, take a picture of the dead body and gain the trust of one of Agent 47’s targets by showing the photo to them. These steps will allow Agent 47 to get an opportunity to be alone with this target and eliminate him quietly. To help you out, here’s how to perfectly hide bodies in Hitman 3.
 
## How to Take Photos in Hitman 3?
 
You can equip the camera from your inventory by cycling through it by left/right D-pad on your controller. For PC players, press I to swap inventory items. Once you have equipped the Camera you can L2/LT/Right mouse button in PS, Xbox & PC respectively. Use your controller’s right analog stick/ mouse to frame your subject then use R2/RT/Left mouse button to take a photo. But keep in mind Hitman 3 has no photo mode. So don’t expect full-fledged photo mode like in other games that support it.
 
Also don’t lose hope yet, as many games are known to get photo mode updates later after their initial release.
