# Unlock the Secret to Professional Envelopes with this Game-Changing Google Docs Template!

Are you tired of sending out lackluster envelopes to important clients, colleagues or customers? Do you want to make a lasting impression with a professional-looking envelope? Look no further! This Google Docs template will help you unlock the secret to creating professional envelopes and help elevate your brand image. 

First, open Google Docs and click on Template Gallery. Search for the Envelope template and choose the one that best suits your needs. Once you have opened the envelope template, start customizing it to fit your brand. 

Here are some key features that will make your envelope stand out: 

## 1. Company Logo: 

Your company's logo is an essential part of your brand identity. Ensure it appears prominently at the top of the envelope along with all other relevant information such as the company name, address and contact information. 

## 2. Brand Colors: 

The color of your envelope can play a significant part in overall branding experience. Choose colors that correspond with your business or brand guidelines. Make sure the colors are consistent across all company materials to create a consistent and memorable image. 

## 3. Typography: 

Selecting the right font style and size can convey professionalism and sophistication. Use a font that is easy to read but also captures your brand's tone and voice. Choose a font style and size that is aesthetically pleasing and fits within the envelope dimensions. 

## 4. Sender and Receiver Information: 

Include all the necessary contact details on the envelope: sender’s name, address, and contact information as well as the recipient's name and contact information. Ensure that they are legible, concise, and accurate so that the envelope reaches its intended addressee. 

## 5. Call to Action: 

Adding a call to action can attract the recipient's attention and encourage them to take action. Whether it's visiting your website or making a phone call, a call to action can make your envelope stand out and lead to a connection with your brand. 

Once the envelope is customized, you can save it as a template and reuse it for future use. Furthermore, you can include all of these visual elements into a design system that can be used across all business materials such as letterheads, business cards, or proposals. Consistency is the key to building a strong brand identity, and these tips can help you create an impressionable image. 

In conclusion, creating professional envelopes is an effective way to elevate your brand image and leave a lasting impression. By utilizing these tips and this Google Docs template, you’ll be able to create aesthetically pleasing envelopes that capture your brand's identity, professionalism and sophistication.

Google Docs doesn’t make creating envelopes an easy process. Unlike other word processors, there aren’t menu buttons or envelope templates built-in to instantly create a pre-sized page for you to build upon.

 

There is, however, add-on support. You can install a Google Docs envelope add-on to access a list of page sizes that transform the document in seconds. All you need to do is edit it with names and addresses, and you'll be ready to print your own envelopes.

 
##   Install an Envelope Template Add-on  
 

Printing envelopes primarily involves choosing the right page size. Google has a handful of preset sizes in the Page setup setting, but we’ll use an add-on to make it even easier.

 
These directions work from the desktop site in any modern browser, like Chrome, Edge, etc.
 
- Go to Extensions > Add-ons > Get add-ons.
 - Search for an add-on like Set A* Page Size that supports changing the paper size.
 - Select it when you see it and then choose Install followed by Continue (you might also need to give it permission to access your Google account). This is what we'll use for the rest of this article.
 - Close out of the install confirmation box and add-on window, and then open the document you want to use as the envelope. It’s fine if it already has addresses written in it, or you can start from scratch.
 - Return to the Extensions menu, but this time choose Set A* Page Size to see a full list of all the supported paper sizes.
 - Select one of the sizes to immediately transform the document. You’ll need to know what your envelope size is so you can match it in millimeters.
 - If the envelope size you need isn't listed, you can opt for a different add-on called Page Sizer, which lets you set any size. If you are totally lost when it comes to envelope sizes, here's a list of standard envelope sizes; there are also conversions between millimeters and inches.

 
##   Add Addresses to the Envelope  
 

Now that the envelope-sized page has been created, you can edit it to include addresses and names. Make the font any color and size you want just as if you were editing a normal document.

 

Go to Extensions > Add-ons > Get add-ons.

 

Search for an add-on like Set A* Page Size that supports changing the paper size.

 

Select it when you see it and then choose Install followed by Continue (you might also need to give it permission to access your Google account). This is what we'll use for the rest of this article.

 

Close out of the install confirmation box and add-on window, and then open the document you want to use as the envelope. It’s fine if it already has addresses written in it, or you can start from scratch.

 

Return to the Extensions menu, but this time choose Set A* Page Size to see a full list of all the supported paper sizes.

 

Select one of the sizes to immediately transform the document. You’ll need to know what your envelope size is so you can match it in millimeters.

 
If the envelope size you need isn't listed, you can opt for a different add-on called Page Sizer, which lets you set any size. If you are totally lost when it comes to envelope sizes, here's a list of standard envelope sizes; there are also conversions between millimeters and inches.
 

You’ll most likely need to double-click in the header section to write the return address. The Tab key is your friend here, so you use it when you need to for alignment purposes.

 

If you need the return address to sit closer to the left margin, feel free to change the margin size via File > Page setup. Set the left margin to 0 so that you can fine-tune exactly where the address should sit.

 
##   Make a Google Docs Envelope Template  
 

With the page configured exactly as you need it for the envelope, with addresses positioned correctly, you now have yourself an envelope template. You can edit over it when you need to print other envelopes, or turn it into a template by copying it as many times as you need to.

 

Go to File > Make a copy to duplicate it and preserve the original. Name it something different and edit it with a different address to make another envelope.
