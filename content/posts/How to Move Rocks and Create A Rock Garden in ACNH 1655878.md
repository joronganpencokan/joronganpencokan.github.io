# Unleash Your Inner Landscaper: Learn the Secrets of Moving Rocks and Building a Stunning Rock Garden in ACNH

Attention all Animal Crossing: New Horizons players! Are you ready to take your island landscaping skills to the next level? If so, it's time to learn the secrets of moving rocks and building a stunning rock garden in ACNH!

Creating a rock garden in Animal Crossing can be quite challenging, but don't fret! This guide will walk you through the steps to help you unleash your inner landscaper and turn your island into a work of art.

First things first, what is a rock garden?

A rock garden is a space on your island that is dedicated to large rocks and pebbles, arranged in a way that creates a peaceful and aesthetically pleasing scene. It can be used as a meditation area or a place to simply relax and appreciate your island's beauty.

Now, onto the details of creating and moving rocks.

Step 1: Choose the Location

Before selecting the location of your rock garden, consider the layout of your island. You want to choose a spot that has enough space to accommodate several large rocks and still looks visually appealing. Once you find a suitable area, mark it with a pattern to prevent any accidental changes.

Step 2: Clear the Area

After choosing a location, make sure to clear the area of any objects, including trees, flowers, and furniture. You want to make sure that there is enough space for the rocks to be placed without any obstructions.

Step 3: Gather Materials

To create a rock garden, you'll need several materials. These include:

- A shovel
- A ladder
- A stone stool or bench
- Several large rocks
- Pebbles or sand

Step 4: Break and Move Rocks

In order to move a rock, you'll need to break it. The best way to do this is to hit the rock with a shovel until it cracks. Once you've broken the rock, dig it up with your shovel and move it to your desired location.

Step 5: Create the Garden

Now that you've gathered your materials and moved the rocks to the desired location, it's time to create the garden. First, place a stone stool or bench in the center of the area. This will be the focal point of the garden. Next, arrange the large rocks around the stool in a manner that is visually appealing. Finally, add pebbles or sand to the ground around the rocks to complete the scene.

Congratulations! You've successfully built your very own rock garden in Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

In conclusion, taking the time to create a beautiful garden can add tremendous value to your Animal Crossing island. Not only will it bring a sense of serenity and harmony to the space, but it also showcases your creative skills as a budding virtual landscaper. So, what are you waiting for? Unleash your inner landscaper and create a stunning rock garden today!

Have you ever wanted to make a rock garden in Animal Crossing New Horizons? A place where all rocks exist right next to each other, cozily wrapped inside a hedge or a fence…or a place where you can go directly to get your daily resources from rocks, instead of roaming around your entire island?
 
Ah, yes, that’s the dream. But the way to complete this dream is nothing short of a nightmare. But if that’s what you want to do, then this rock garden guide is for you. In this guide, you will know how to move rocks and make a rock garden in ACNH.
 
## How to Move Rocks and Build a Rock Garden
 
Youtuber Mayor Mori has made a fantastic tutorial video about moving rocks and arranging them to make a rock garden.
 

 
### Moving Rocks in ACNH
 
To move rocks into your desired rock garden location, you need:
 
- 1 Shovel
 - The perfect location
 - Mannequins
 - Strong willpower

 
### Select the Area
 
First, you need to pick an area where your final rock garden will be located. There are a total of 6 rocks that will spawn on your island, so if you want, you can decide to place all 6 rocks within a fenced area.
 
A rock garden requires great forward planning, so if you want some sand under your rocks in your rock garden, you must do it before the rocks spawn in there. Make sure to prepare the area as per your wish beforehand.
 
Now, dig holes in the area where you want the rocks to respawn. You need an area of 9 x 7 tiles, where you can have 6 rocks in two rows (three rocks in each). Whatever pattern you choose, you must keep 8 empty tiles around the slot for the rock, because that’s the space rocks need in order to spawn. If there’s anything obstructing it, the rock will not appear there.
 
### Let the Rock Destruction Begin
 
Your next goal will be to destroy all the rocks that are available all over your island. Don’t worry, they will respawn, so you won’t lose them forever.
 
In order to do this, you can take a shovel with you, eat a fruit and smash a rock. Eating the fruit will give you fruit energy which will make you capable of destroying rocks with your shovel.
 
### Add Mannequins
 
Mayor Mori has cleverly noted the use of ‘mannequins’ to block the spots where rocks can spawn all over the island. The aim is to put obstructions on those spots and ensure that the rocks spawn at your desired location, that is, the rock garden.
 
### Use a Custom Design
 
To block those spots all over your island, you need to use a custom design that is not already attached to anything else.
 
Next, select ‘Display Here’ and then select ‘Mannequin’.
 
Soon, the nightmare part of this mission will begin. What you need to do with these mannequins is place them wherever rocks might spawn, all over your island.
 
The places where rocks cannot spawn are –
 
- A stone path
 - A wooden path
 - Right next to a tree and a building
 - On a cliff edge, river edge and the beach

 
So go ahead, and begin placing your mannequins. A rock needs 8 free tiles around it to spawn, so make sure to block such areas where rocks might appear. This task is monotonous but it will give you your rock garden in the end. So, hold on for a bit longer.
 
### The Waiting Game
 
Now, only one rock spawns in a day, so wait until all your rocks appear in your designated area. If they don’t, you have most likely missed a spot on your island where it has spawned instead.
 
And that’s how you can create your very own rock garden by moving rocks in Animal Crossing New Horizons. To clean up the large amount of mannequins on your island, Mayor Mori gives a wonderful tip. Just go to your custom design and select ‘Change Design’. Change it to anything else and save it. Poof, this will make all your mannequins disappear in a flash. This tip saves a lot of time since the task of picking all those mannequins back is enough to give anyone another nightmare.
 
But all is well because after this whole mission, your rock garden will be ready for viewing. Hitting rocks and collecting resources also gets much faster this way.
