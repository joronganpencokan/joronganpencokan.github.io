If you’re like most people, you probably use Gmail as your primary email client. With over 1.5 billion active users, Gmail is the most popular email service in the world.

And now, Gmail has undergone a massive facelift. Google has just unveiled a new version of Gmail that promises to revolutionize the way we use email.

So what’s new? Here are a few of the key features:

### A Refreshed Design

The first thing you’ll notice about the new Gmail is the refreshed design. Google has taken a clean, minimalist approach to the redesign, making it even easier to navigate your inbox.

The new design also includes a bunch of new features that make it easier to manage your emails. You can hover over an email to archive, delete, or mark it as unread, and there’s a new “snooze” feature that lets you temporarily remove an email from your inbox and have it reappear at a later time.

### Improved Security

Google has also made significant improvements to Gmail’s security. The new version includes features like confidential mode, which allows you to send emails that expire after a set time or require a password to open.

Gmail’s spam filters have also been significantly improved, and there’s a new way to report phishing emails directly from the email itself.

### Artificial Intelligence

Google has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence, and the new Gmail is no exception. The new version uses AI-based features to help you manage your inbox more efficiently.

For example, Gmail will now suggest you to unsubscribe from newsletters that you never read and archive them. Also, the new version includes a “smart compose” feature that uses AI to suggest phrases and sentences as you type, making it easier to compose emails quickly.

### Offline Access

Finally, the new Gmail includes improved offline access, making it possible to access and compose emails even when you don’t have an internet connection.

Overall, the new Gmail promises to be a game-changer, making email management more accessible, faster and secure. We are sure that, once you give it a try, you’ll be wondering how you ever managed without it.

There’s no doubt that Google’s Gmail has established itself as one of the best services for managing emails. The team behind this success has worked day and night to ensure that users have a clean, robust, intuitive and secure platform from which they can easily manage all their virtual correspondence. Recently, according to some newly-leaked info, the app is set for a significant overhaul that will see it incorporate a completely new, modern design.
 
If you’re a long-time Gmail user as many of us here at MTE are, you’ll know that Gmail’s developers have ensured that their mobile as well as web services are up to scratch. While the mobile apps have been the main focus for the past couple of years, the web service, too, has been modernized to a degree, but apparently, there’s still a lot more to come.
 

 
Leaked screenshots and information show how Google may be planning to introduce a new smooth modern approach, removing its current boring tab bar on the left side on the window and replacing it with a drop-down menu. Kind of similar to what Microsoft did with the Windows 8 menus. This feature should help keep menus hidden when not in use and giving an overall feeling of minimalism.
 
The right-hand side will feature a Hangouts pane, which can also be collapsed/expanded at user convenience. And as far as full-screen is concerned, this look would definitely suit it, and it would be a lot easier for a user to scan over their emails at a glance.
 
It’s not uncommon for some folks to receive over hundreds of emails daily. Managing them can be a real issue. If left unchecked, they can build up to unmanageable levels. If Google indeed does place this new and improved system in place, which also includes a pin system to replace the current “starring” of important emails, some of these features could make the task of emailing a whole lot less cumbersome.
 
So, do tell us, what do you make of this new prospective look? Do you like it or not really? Be sure to share your thoughts below in the comments!
