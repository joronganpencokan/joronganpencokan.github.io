Once your Spectacles are connected, you should see a list of all the snaps stored on the device. You can browse through them, preview them, and select the ones you want to import. Select the snaps that you want to import, and then click on the "Import" button.

The software will then begin the importing process, which should only take a few minutes (depending on the number of snaps you're importing). Once the process is complete, you'll be able to view your snaps in the Spectacles software. From here, you can download them to your computer or upload them to your preferred social media platform.

This article explains how to import Snaps from Snapchat spectacles onto a paired iOS or Android device.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- On Android with Wi-Fi Direct importing happens automatically behind the scenes directly to Memories in the Snapchat app.On iOS, once in Memories in the Snapchat app, an option to Import Snaps from Spectacles will appear at the top of the screen.From Memories, you can save Snaps to your phone's camera roll and send your Snaps off to whoever you'd like, like any other Snap.

 

Once imported, Snaps are by default deleted off your Spectacles, freeing up space.

 
##   How to Import Snaps on Android  
 

With the release of Android 4.0 in 2011 came Wi-Fi Direct support: A wireless technology which can transfer large amounts of data very quickly between nearby devices without the use of a router.

 
While most Android devices support automatic Snap importation, iOS devices take only a few taps and a couple of seconds to import Snaps off Spectacles, so don't worry about a lot of inconvenience using Spectacles on iOS.
 

While you may need to confirm your particular device supports Wi-Fi Direct with a simple online search, most Android devices today support the technology.

 

With Wi-Fi direct, all an Android user with Spectacles paired to their phone has to do is take Snaps and they'll automatically be imported into the Snapchat Memories tab, accessible by a swipe up from the camera in the Snapchat app.

 
##   How to Import Snaps on iOS  
 

Apple has opted to discontinue Wi-Fi Direct support in iOS in favor of focusing on their own wireless technology called AirDrop.

 

Unfortunately, Snapchat doesn't support AirDrop in the same way it supports Wi-Fi Direct, so you can't automatically import Snaps on iOS.

 

Luckily, all you have to do on iOS is from the Snapchat app, swipe up from the camera and tap import at the top of the screen.

 

Depending on your iOS version (iOS 11 and above or iOS 10) there'll be either a single pop-up or a few pop-ups with instructions walking you through connecting to your Spectacles. Then, your Snaps will also appear in the Memories tab.

 
##   Notes on Snapchat Spectacles Snaps  
 

Importing Snaps from Spectacles is designed to not require much input from the user, but there are a few things to keep in mind

 
- iOS users have the option to enable Spectacles Home Wi-Fi Import, which means when connected to your home network and plugged in, Spectacles will automatically upload their Snaps to your phone.
 - If your Android device doesn't support Wi-Fi Direct, from the Memories tab you can tap the Import button like on iOS.
 - Videos and pictures taken on Spectacles are formatted in circles (the lenses on the glasses), so when viewing them in Snapchat anyone can rotate their device to see more of the image.

 
- How many Snaps can my Spectacles hold?
 - Spectacles can hold a maximum of 150 video Snaps or 3,000 still Snaps. The total capacity may vary depending on the length of your videos. Snaps are automatically deleted from Spectacles' storage after they get imported to your phone.

 - From the camera tab, tap the Memories icon (the overlapping photos) under the Camera button, then tap Camera Roll. To edit a photo or video, tap the three dots in the upper-right corner and select Edit Photo or Edit Snap.
 - How do I protect my privacy on Snapchat?
 - There are a number of steps you can take to protect your privacy on Snapchat such as setting up two-factor authentication and controlling who can contact you or see your Stories. You can even password protect your Snaps with the My Eyes Only feature.
