The tech world was hit with a wave of excitement as Google announced a game-changing update for iOS 16. The company has finally decided to side with Apple and add lock screen widget support, upgrading the iOS users' experience with the latest update.

Widgets have been around on iOS for some time now, but lock screen widgets were previously limited to Apple's own apps like weather, calendar, and other native applications. However, with this new update, users can now enjoy a host of widgets from third-party providers right on their lock screens.

Google is already known for its popular apps and services, and the company is determined to take things a notch higher. With the new lock screen widget support, a plethora of Google's popular tools can be displayed on the lock screen, including Google Keep, Calendar, Assistant, Maps, and more.

Having quick access to these apps while the phone is locked will save lots of time and make things much simpler for users. It will allow them to quickly check their calendar, create tasks on Keep, get directions on Google Maps, or even get the latest news updates.

This move by Google is not only great for iOS users, but it also showcases the healthy level of competition in the tech industry. Google's push to bring lock screen widget support to iOS shows that companies can work together to improve each other's products and services.

Additionally, this update aligns with Google's goal of providing seamless integration across all platforms, which only reinforces their commitment to improving their users' experience.

In conclusion, Google's announcement of lock screen widget support for iOS is a significant move that will change how iOS users interact with their devices. By showcasing their commitment to improving user experience on different platforms, Google establishes itself as a brand that cares about its users' needs, which is something that should be celebrated in the tech world.

Google is getting ready for iOS 16 with plans to incorporate custom lock screen widgets into several of its existing apps.

 

If you've ever wished to use Google (or any of its other services) directly from your iPhone's lock screen, you're in luck. Google just announced it is adding lock screen widgets to many apps that will take advantage of the new iOS 16 feature. It won't just be for Google searches, either, though you will have the option of checking the internet via text, voice, or camera without unlocking your phone.

 

Widget support will also work for Chromeâ€”allowing you to launch the browser from your lock screen (you can even go into Incognito Mode), search with your voice, or play the 'dino game.' Drive is getting support and will allow you to immediately open suggested or starred shared files. Maps is included as well, but its functions stretch beyond just opening the app from the lock screen. The Frequent Trips widget will provide real-time travel estimates to places you commonly visit (home, work, etc.), while you can use the Search widget to find nearby points of interest or necessity.

 

Additionally, Gmail will be able to show you how many unread messages you have while your phone is still locked. It will also have an option to break down messages by category in case you want to see how many unread emails are high-priority. Finally, the News widget will display real-time headlines on your lock screen, with the option to tap on a headline that interests you to view the full story.

 

Lock screen widget functionality is expected to roll out for Google's various apps "in the coming weeks," but Google has not provided a specific date. Whether you already have the supported apps installed or plan to download them, once the updates are live, you can press and hold on your iPhone's lock screen to begin using them.
