In addition to its popular streaming stick and media player, Roku has partnered with several TV makers to incorporate the Roku operating system directly into television sets. This allows Roku to work without need for an external stick or box.

 

Haier, Hisense, Hitachi, Insignia, Sharp, and TCL all make Roku-compatible televisions, with many offering either 720p or 1080p resolution. Some 4K Ultra HD TV models are also available.

 

Among those, Hitachi stands out with a full line of 4K/UHD HDR Roku TVs. There are 14 such models, ranging in size from 43 to 65 inches.

 
##   Hitachi Roku 4K Ultra HD TV Basics  
 

Roku features are the same on all compatible TV sets. This includes a personalized home screen that provides easy access to internet streaming content and a 4K Spotlight feature that provides quick access to all available 4K streaming content. Other TV functions, such as input selection and picture settings, are accessible via the Roku home screen.

 
4K via streaming requires very fast broadband speeds, with Netflix recommending as much as 25mbps. If your broadband speed is insufficient for 4K streaming, Netflix and other content providers will "downscale" the signal to 1080p resolution.
 

You can browse through channels or content, or use the search function for a more narrow selection. The Roku Feed option can remind you when a specific show or event is coming, and if there is a fee to watch it.

 
##   Additional Hitachi Roku TV Features  
 

Hitachi Roku TVs include a variety of extra features, settings, and functions. Here are some of them:

 
- HDR: HDR processing dramatically improves the dynamic range or contrast of the television picture quality.
 - DLNA and UPnP compatibility: All TVs in this line can be used to access compatible audio, video, and still image files from your home network connected devices, including computers and laptops.
 - Roku Remote: Hitachi's Roku TVs can be controlled through the provided Roku remote control, or via a compatible remote control app available on iOS or Android devices.
 - Miracast: Allows users to stream videos, photos, and music from compatible smartphones directly to the TV.
 - Ethernet/Wi-Fi: Choose between a wired and wireless internet connection.
 - Direct-Lit LCD TV: With a 60hz screen refresh rate, all of the Hitachi sets incorporate backlight scanning. This means the LED backlight flashes 120 times per second, improving the perceived motion of objects on the screen.
 - Built-in Tuners: Tuners allow for the reception of over-the-air and unscrambled digital cable TV signals.
 - 4 HDMI Inputs: This allows you to connect up to four Blu-ray/DVD players, soundbars, video game consoles, set-top boxes, or other components at a time.
 - Composite video/analog stereo input: These inputs allow you to connect old or analog devices like VCRs and camcorders.

 
- USB Port: Access audio, video, still images, and other media stored on USB flash drives. The USB port can also be used as an option for installing firmware updates if they cannot be downloaded and installed via the internet.
 - Headphone jack: The headphone jack allows the transmission of analog audio from the TV to headphones or audio system with an Aux input (3.5mm).
 - Digital Optical Output: These outputs can deliver quality sound to a home theater receiver, sound bar, or under-TV audio system that has corresponding digital optical inputs.
 - Audio Return Channel (ARC): Allows for easy HDMI connection with compatible home theater receivers, soundbars, or under-TV audio systems that are also Audio Return Channel equipped.
