## How to Install Oculus Elite Strap on Your Quest 2
 
The Oculus Elite Strap will replace the standard strap that came with the headset. Installing the brand-new Oculus Elite Strap is not a herculean task. However, there are chances that you may damage your headset if done incorrectly. This is why we have created a step-by-step guide to help you out:
 

 
### Remove the Facial Interface
 
First things first, remove the facial interface of your Quest 2. It is a cover that guards your VR lenses. To move further, you will first need to take the facial interface off your headset.
 
### Detach the Standard Straps
 
Now, you will need to detach the standard straps. All you need to do is is pull outwards and twist slightly on either side of the straps to safely remove them. Carefully pull the velcro strap between your lenses. Remember to not pull the fabric as you’ll risk damaging your headset. That’s it, you have removed your standard straps completely. Now, to the final part.
 
### Install the Elite Strap on your Quest
 
### 
 
Once you have removed the old strap, line up your Elite Strap. Clip both the sides of the strap on your Quest 2. This part is way easier than you expected. All you need to do is put the top head strap through the gap between your lenses. Once you’ve done that, put back the Facial Interface to complete the installation process. Your Elite Strap is now successfully attached to the headset. Keep the upper head strap so that you can easily wear it. You can adjust it anyway you like after putting it on.
