**Unlock the Untapped Potential of Your Xiaomi Mi 3 - Learn the Secret to Rooting!**

Are you tired of the limited functionality of your Xiaomi Mi 3? Do you want to take full control of your device and access its untapped potential? The answer lies in rooting your Xiaomi Mi 3. 

Rooting is the process of gaining root access or administrative privileges on your Android smartphone. It enables you to remove limitations set by your phone's manufacturer and carrier, which would otherwise restrict access to advanced features and customization options. By rooting your Xiaomi Mi 3, you can install custom ROMs, tweak performance settings, remove bloatware, and much more.

In this article, we'll guide you through the process of rooting your Xiaomi Mi 3 using the popular tool - Magisk. But before we proceed, it's important to note that rooting your phone can void its warranty, and if it's not done correctly, it can also brick your device. So, make sure to follow the instructions carefully and take a backup of your important data before proceeding.

**Step 1: Enable USB Debugging**

To begin with, you need to enable USB Debugging on your Xiaomi Mi 3. This can be done by going to "Settings" -> "About phone" -> "MIUI version" and tapping it several times until it shows "You are now a developer!". Then go back to the "Settings" menu and select "Developer options". Here, turn on "USB debugging".

**Step 2: Download Magisk**

Next, you need to download Magisk, which is a popular tool for rooting Android devices. You can download the latest version of Magisk Manager apk from the official website or popular third-party Android repositories. 

**Step 3: Install Magisk**

Once you have downloaded Magisk apk on your Xiaomi Mi 3, install it like any other app. Once the installation is complete, launch the Magisk Manager app from your app drawer.

**Step 4: Root Your Xiaomi Mi 3**

Before proceeding with rooting, ensure that you have a stable internet connection. In the Magisk Manager app, click on "Install" and then select "Download." This will download the necessary files to root your Xiaomi Mi 3.

Once the download is complete, click on "Install" again, and then select "Install" from the popup that appears. This will begin the rooting process, which may take a few minutes to complete. After the process is done, your Xiaomi Mi 3 will be successfully rooted.

**Step 5: Verify Root Access**

To verify if your Xiaomi Mi 3 has been rooted successfully, go to the Google Play Store and download any root checker app. Open the app and click on "Verify Root." If the app displays the message "Congratulations! This device has root access," then your Xiaomi Mi 3 has been successfully rooted.

**Final Words**

By rooting your Xiaomi Mi 3, you can unlock the untapped potential of your device and enjoy a plethora of advanced features and customization options. However, be aware that rooting your device can open it up to security risks, so be careful with what apps you install and where you download them from. Also, make sure to keep your phone's software updated to avoid any potential issues. So, follow the instructions carefully and enjoy the full potential of your Xiaomi Mi 3.

If you are looking to root the Snapdragon variant of Mi 3, simply follow the steps below.
While the steps below will not wipe the handset of your data, it is always recommended to make a backup in case things go wrong. Also, the below steps are only for the WCDMA variant of the Mi 3 that comes with a Snapdragon 800 processor and is sold in India and other neighboring markets.
Step 1: Make sure to update your Mi 3 to the latest build of MIUI (v23). Then, proceed to download the root package linked in this XDA thread and transfer it to the internal storage of your device.
Step 2: On your Mi 3, head over to Settings -> About Phone and tap the System Updates option. Once the phone is done checking for updates, tap the Menu button followed by the ‘Select update package’ option and select the root package you had transferred in the previous step.

Step 3: Once the phone is done applying the update, it will automatically reboot itself. Once it is done rebooting, open the Security app and select the Permission option.
