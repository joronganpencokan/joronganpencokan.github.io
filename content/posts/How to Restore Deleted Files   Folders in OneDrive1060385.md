Title: Discover the Secret Trick to Retrieve Any Deleted Files or Folders from OneDrive in Just a Few Clicks!

Have you ever accidentally deleted important files or folders from your OneDrive? It can be frustrating and downright devastating, especially if you don't know how to retrieve them. But don't worry, there is a secret trick to recover any deleted files or folders from OneDrive in just a few clicks.

Step 1: Check the Recycle Bin

Before doing anything else, the first thing you should do is check the recycle bin. When you delete a file or folder on OneDrive, they are not immediately removed from your account. Instead, they are sent to the recycle bin, where they remain for a certain amount of time.

To check the recycle bin, log in to your OneDrive account and click on the "Recycle bin" option on the left-hand side menu. Here, you will find all the recently deleted files or folders. If you find the missing file or folder, simply right-click on it and click on "Restore" to bring it back to its original location.

Step 2: Restore Deleted Files or Folders Using the Version History

If the file or folder you are looking for is not in the recycle bin or if it has been permanently deleted from there, you can still restore it using the version history. The version history feature keeps track of all the changes made to your files and folders on OneDrive, allowing you to revert to an earlier version.

To access the version history, right-click on the file or folder and click on "Version history." This will bring up a list of all the saved versions of the file. Select the version you want to restore and click on "Restore" to bring it back to the original location.

Step 3: Using a Third-Party Tool

If the above methods do not work, you can use a third-party tool to recover the deleted files or folders from OneDrive. There are several data recovery software and tools available on the internet that can help you recover lost or deleted files from OneDrive.

Some of the popular data recovery tools for OneDrive include Recuva, Disk Drill, and EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard. These tools are free to use and can help you recover the deleted files quickly and easily.

Conclusion

Losing important files or folders from OneDrive can be stressful, but with the above tricks, you can easily recover them in just a few clicks. Always remember to check the recycle bin and use the version history before resorting to a third-party tool. With a little effort, you can avoid the loss of critical data and keep your OneDrive files and folders safe and secure.
