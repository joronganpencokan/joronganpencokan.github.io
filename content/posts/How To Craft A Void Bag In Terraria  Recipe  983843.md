# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Craft A Game-Changing Void Bag in Terraria - Get Your Hands On The Recipe Now!

If you're a fan of Terraria, then you already know how important it is to have a good storage system in place. With so many items to collect and craft, it can be frustrating to constantly run out of room. That's where the Void Bag comes in.

The Void Bag is a game-changing item that allows you to store up to 20 items inside it, without taking up any inventory space. That means you can carry all of your essential gear and items with you wherever you go, without having to worry about running out of room.

But how do you craft a Void Bag? It's actually easier than you might think.

To start, you'll need some key items:

- 1 Magic Mirror (obtained from chests or craftable with 15 glass and 10 silver bars)
- 1 Rotten Chunk (obtained from corrupt enemies or crafted with 15 Vile Powder)
- 100 Pixie Dust (obtained from pixies in the Hallow)
- 1 Vile Powder (obtained from corrupt enemies or crafted with 1 Rotten Chunk and 1 Mushroom)
- 1 Tattered Cloth (obtained from Angry Bones or Dark Casters in the Dungeon)

Once you have these items, head to a Demon Altar and combine them using the following recipe:

- Magic Mirror
- Rotten Chunk
- 100 Pixie Dust
- Vile Powder
- Tattered Cloth

Once you've combined these items, a Void Bag will be created. Simply place it in your inventory, and you're good to go!

So why is the Void Bag such a game-changer? As mentioned earlier, it allows you to carry up to 20 items without taking up any inventory space. This means you can carry all of your essential items with you at all times, without having to constantly swap them out for other items.

Additionally, the Void Bag can be equipped in an accessory slot, which means you can use it alongside other important accessories like the Spectre Boots or the Lucky Horseshoe.

Overall, the Void Bag is an essential item for any Terraria player. Its ease-of-crafting and game-changing benefits make it a must-have for anyone looking to master the game.

So what are you waiting for? Head to your nearest Demon Altar and craft your own Void Bag today!

With several unique bosses, armor, weapons and items – Terraria has the capacity to thrill you endlessly. However, with so many items, your inventory is bound to reach its carrying capacity. Luckily, the game’s developers have given the players the ability to create an additional inventory – Void Vault. It can only be accessed by using the Void Bag – which has to be crafted by players. If you’re wondering about how to get a Void Bag in Terraria, then you’re at the right place because this guide is surely going to help you out.
 
## Void Bag Recipe in Terraria
 
The Void Vault is a placeable item that can upgrade your inventory similar to the Piggybank, Safe and Defender’s Forge in Terraria. Once the player’s inventory becomes full, the excess items can be sent to the Void Vault only if you have a Void Bag. Without further ado, let us look at the recipe to make a Void Bag:
 
Demon Altar
 
- Bone (30)
 - Jungle Spores (15)
 - Shadow Scales (30)

 

 
Crimson Altar
 
- Bone (30)
 - Jungle Spores (15)
 - Tissue Samples (30)

 
If you notice, we have mentioned different recipes for two crafting stations – the Demon Altar and the Crimson Altar. If you make a Void Bag on the Demon Altar, you will need 30x Bone, 15x Jungle Spores and 30x Shadow Scale. Alternatively, if you’re crafting a Void Bag on the Crimson Altar, the first two ingredients will be the same but the Shadow Scale will be replaced by 30x Tissue Sample.
 
Once you gather all these items, you will be able to craft a Void Bag in Terraria. However, keep in mind that the Void Bag can only be crafted after you defeat Skeletron. This is because the Bones that you obtain for the recipe will be dropped from the enemies in the Dungeon.
 
That brings us to the end of our guide. We hope we successfully helped you craft a Void Bag in Terraria. For more such guides, stay tuned to our Terraria guides page.
