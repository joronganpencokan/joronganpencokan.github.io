##   Finding the iPhone SIM Card Ejector Tool  
 

The SIM card tool for ejecting the tray from the side of the iPhone comes in the box as long as your country and network-specific iPhone include it.

##   Try These Items to Eject a SIM Tray  
 

The opening used to eject a SIM card tray is tiny. Although plenty of straight objects might work, the SIM hole requires something sturdy with a narrow dimension.

 

Here are some ideas that have worked:

 
Watch your thumb when pushing any of these tools you may have around the house into your phone. Most of them are sharp and could pierce the skin.
 
- Paper clip: Most small and average size paper clips work by bending one side. If you don't have a SIM removal tool, a paper clip works well.Safety pin: Not all sizes of safety pins work. Find the smallest safety pin possible to fit inside the hole.Earring: An earring works in a pinch. Take off the earring back and insert the post into the SIM tray hole. Be careful because soft materials such as gold bend easily.Staple: A standard staple can come through in a pinch, but it may be hard to use because it is thin and flexible. A thicker, industrial staple is a better choice.Mechanical pencil: To use a mechanical pencil, give it a few clicks to extend it farther than you would to write. Poke the point in the hole and give it a firm push. It's challenging to use because of how brittle the lead is, but it's a common item found around the house or in a backpack.Toothpick: Most toothpicks are a little too wide for the iPhone SIM hole. Whittle away some of the wood to make it fit and break off the tip.Fishing hook: Fishing hooks come in various shapes and sizes, so if you're off on a boat and need an emergency SIM swap, try one of these.
