Master the Art of Slaying in Halo Infinite with these Secret Slayer Mode Tips!

Halo Infinite is the latest addition to the iconic Halo series, and it is already creating a buzz among gamers. The game's Slayer mode is one of its most popular modes, and it's easy to see why. In this mode, you have one simple objective: eliminate the enemy team. But, how do you become a master at slaying in Halo Infinite? That's what we will be discussing in this article. Read on to learn some secret slayer mode tips that will help you dominate your opponents.

1. Always be aware of your surroundings

In Slayer mode, your enemies can come from any direction. It's important to always be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye out for enemies. Use the terrain and the environment to your advantage, and always be on the lookout for enemy ambushes.

2. Choose the right weapon for the job

In Halo Infinite, there are a plethora of weapons to choose from. Each weapon has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's essential to choose the right weapon for the situation. For example, if you're in close quarters, a shotgun or a sword may be the best choice, but if you're at long range, a sniper rifle or a needle rifle may be more suitable.

3. Coordinate with your team

Slayer mode is a team game, and coordination is key to success. Always communicate with your teammates and work together to take down the enemy. Assign roles to each player, such as a sniper, a scout, or a frontline soldier, and play to your strengths.

4. Keep moving

In Slayer mode, standing still is a death sentence. Always keep moving and avoid staying in one place for too long. Move quickly and unpredictably, and use cover to avoid enemy fire.

5. Learn the map

Knowing the map is crucial in Slayer mode. Take the time to explore the map and learn the layouts, choke points, and power weapon locations. This knowledge will give you an edge over your opponents and help you navigate the map more efficiently.

6. Use your equipment

Halo Infinite offers a variety of equipment, such as grapple hooks, repulsors, and drop walls. Don't be afraid to use your equipment to gain the advantage over your opponents. The grapple hook, for example, can be used to traverse the map quickly and reach otherwise inaccessible areas.

7. Stay alive

In Slayer mode, staying alive is just as important as eliminating the enemy team. Always prioritize your safety and avoid taking unnecessary risks. If you're low on health, retreat to a safe area and let your shields recharge.

In conclusion, becoming a Slayer master in Halo Infinite takes practice, strategy, and the right mindset. Always be aware of your surroundings, choose the right weapon, coordinate with your team, keep moving, learn the map, use your equipment, and stay alive. Follow these tips, and you'll be well on your way to slaying your enemies with ease. Happy gaming!

## How to Play Slayer in Halo Infinite
 

 
Like I have said, Slayer is a Team Deathmatch game mode played between two teams. The first team to reach 50 kills (100 kills in bigger team maps) or the team that has the highest kill count by the end of the timer wins. At the start of the round, all players will get basic weapons like Pistols & Assault Rifles. With these weapons, you will have other utilities like Grenades and the like. As the Slayer game progresses, power weapons and vehicles will spawn in and around the map. Gaining control of these types of equipment will put your team at a huge advantage.
 
Slayer Mode in Halo Infinite does not have its dedicated playlist. So, if you want to play the game mode then you will have to queue in Ranked Arena, Bot Bootcamp, Big Team Battles, and Quick Play. You cannot select only Slayer Mode from these playlists. So you will have to queue in multiple games just to get a chance to play Slayer. Another way to play Slayer is to set up a Custom game, that sets the mode to Slayer. This will allow you to play with your friends in Halo Infinite. Matchmaking with this method is not possible.
