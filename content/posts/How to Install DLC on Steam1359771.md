Unlock the Ultimate Gaming Experience: Learn How to Install DLC on Steam Like a Pro!

Playing a game's downloadable content (DLC) is the ultimate way of enhancing and elevating your overall gaming experience. With the right DLC installed on Steam, you can get access to new characters, game modes, maps, and even brand-new storylines. But, installing these add-ons can be confusing for many gamers. If you're one of those gamers, then keep reading—we're here to help.

In this guide, we'll show you how to add DLC to your Steam collection and teach you some tips and tricks to make the process a breeze.

Preparation

Before downloading additional content for your game on Steam, make sure that you have the base game installed on your computer. DLCs are unusable without the main game.

From Steam, search for the base game that the DLC is for and double-check that it is installed on your system. You can find it on the Steam app by navigating to the “Library” tab and then searching for the game in question. Your image should appear on the app screen alongside the title of the game.

Finding the desired DLC

After installing the base game, your next step is to get the DLC that you want to install. There are several ways to get the extra content on Steam, but the most common is by visiting the game's store page and searching under the "DLC" category.

Alternatively, you can use the built-in Steam search feature and search for the game's name, followed by “DLC.” This will direct you to the DLC pack that you want to install.

Purchasing and downloading the DLC

Once you have found the DLC you want to add to your game’s content, look for the “Add to Cart" button or the price displayed below the download button. 

Note that not all DLCs on Steam are free of charge, so prepare your digital wallet beforehand. The payment process through Steam is quite intuitive; click the payment method you prefer and choose “Buy.” If you have enabled Steam's two-factor authentication, make sure to have your device nearby to complete the authentication process by entering either the verification code sent to your mobile device or email address.

After paying, the DLC download should begin automatically. In some cases, you will need to restart your Steam client to finish the DLC’s installation.

Activating the DLC

Upon successful installation of DLC on Steam, the DLC should be visible in the downloaded content / DLC tab for the base game.

To manage DLC content, open the game’s “Properties” and then click on the “DLC” tab. Here, you can select the DLC you want to play and install it directly. Alternatively, you can check “automatically install all” to install all DLCs related to the game.

Final Thoughts

Now that you know how to install DLCs on Steam, you can take your gaming experience to the next level with new content packs. However, before you purchase or install any content, make sure to research the DLC you want to add to the game. Some DLCs might not be worth buying, and you might end up wasting your money.

Remember, DLCs can bring new life to games that you have already completed while also providing new challenges and rewarding experiences. Now, it's up to you to discover which DLCs are worth your time and budget.

So, why wait? Start exploring and experimenting with all the incredible add-ons that Steam has to offer today!

If you ever play PC games, then you'll probably want to know how to install Downloadable Content (DLC) on Steam. Many games offer DLC as in-app purchases, but you can also purchase DLC directly from Steam, or you can use a product key purchased elsewhere.

 
##   DLC on Steam  
 

Downloadable content is extra content that players can download after purchasing a game. DLC can include additional levels, new features, and cosmetic extras like character outfits and skins. Steam collaborates with game developers to offer DLC in its online store.

 
Instructions in this article apply to the Steam desktop client for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
 

Most DLC purchased from Steam installs automatically, but some games require DLC to be authorized through a third-party app. Other games require a verification code to activate DLC.

 
##   How to Download DLC on Steam  
 

To purchase and install DLC directly from Steam:

 
- Launch the Steam client and select Library.
 - Select your game in the left column.
 - Select Store Page.
 - Scroll down and select the DLC you want under Content for this game.
 - Complete your purchase, then select Install content on the receipt page.

 
###   How to Manage DLC on Steam  
 

Now, when you select the game in your Library, you'll see a DLC section. Select Manage my DLC to enable or disable your extra content.

 

Launch the Steam client and select Library.

 

Select your game in the left column.

 

Select Store Page.

 

Scroll down and select the DLC you want under Content for this game.

 

Complete your purchase, then select Install content on the receipt page.

 

Another way to manage your DLC in Steam is to right-click the game and select Properties. In the Properties menu, select the DLC tab to see all installed DLC for the game.

 
##   How to Install DLC on Steam With a Product Key  
 

Steam keys can be purchased from various vendors and work like traditional product keys that come packaged with physical copies of games. If you purchase a game with DLC from a store, the key for the DLC may be printed on your recipient or on a special card included in the game's case. Sometimes when you buy content from Steam or other online retailers, the developer will send you an email with a product key.

 

To activate DLC on Steam with a key:

 
Beware of websites that offer "free" product keys for Steam. Such sites often contain malware that can collect your private data.
 
- Launch the Steam client and select Add a game in the bottom-left corner, then select Activate a Product on Steam in the pop-up window.
 - Select Next, then accept the Steam subscriber agreement.
 - Enter the key under Product Code and select Next to install the content.

 
##   How to Troubleshoot DLC on Steam  
 

If your Steam DLC is not installed right away, check your email to make sure there aren't additional steps required to activate the content, then try these steps in order:

 

Launch the Steam client and select Add a game in the bottom-left corner, then select Activate a Product on Steam in the pop-up window.

 

Select Next, then accept the Steam subscriber agreement.

 

Enter the key under Product Code and select Next to install the content.

 
- Check your downloads. Go to your Downloads page to see if the download is still in progress. If the download is stalled, or if the installation was successful yet the DLC is still not working, move on to the next step.
 - Restart the Steam client. Select Steam > Exit in the top-left corner, then reopen the program.
 - Reconnect to the Steam servers. Select your username in the top-right corner, then select Log out of account. The Steam client will close, and you must provide your password to log back in.
 - Restart your computer. Restarting your system can often resolve software installation issues.
 - Validate the game files. Open the Properties menu for the game and select the Local Files tab, then select Verify Integrity of Game Files. Steam will automatically repair any files that need it.
 - Check the Community Hub. See if anyone else has reported similar issues on the game's Community page. If so, you'll likely find suggestions for how to fix the problem.
 - Wait a while. Sometimes the Steam servers get overwhelmed, so you just have to be patient. You can check the SteamStatus website to see what traffic is like in your region.
 - Report the issue to Steam. If your DLC still isn't working, visit Steam's customer support page. Sign into your account and select the content you're having problems with for further help.
