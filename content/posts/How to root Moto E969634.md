Are you tired of the restricted access to your Moto E's features and settings? Do you want to unleash the full potential of your device? Look no further! Rooting your Moto E is the perfect way to do just that.

For the uninitiated, rooting is the process of gaining administrative access to your android device's system files. This means that you'll have complete control over your device, allowing you to customize it to your heart's content.

Here's a step-by-step guide to rooting your Moto E:

Step 1: Backup Your Data

Before rooting your device, it's important to back up all of your data including contacts, photos, videos, and messages. You can use various backup apps available on the google play store for this purpose.

Step 2: Download Rooting App

There are several apps available on the internet for rooting your Moto E. One of the most popular is KingRoot. Download the app on your device from the official website or through an internet search.

Step 3: Install KingRoot

After downloading, install the KingRoot app on your device by clicking on the 'Install' button.

Step 4: Run KingRoot

Launch the KingRoot app, and click on the 'Start Root' button. The app will begin rooting your device, and it may take a few minutes for the process to complete.

Step 5: Restart your Moto E

After the rooting process is complete, reboot your device to finalize the changes. Now your Moto E is completely rooted, and you have full access to its system files.

With your device rooted, you can enjoy benefits such as customizing themes and fonts, installing custom ROMs, unlocking hidden features, and even overclocking the processor for increased performance.

However, it's important to note that rooting your device can also come with some potential risks. Your device's warranty may be voided, and there's always the possibility of damaging your device if you're not careful.

In conclusion, if you're willing to take the plunge and root your Moto E, you'll be able to unlock its full potential and tailor it to your own preferences. But always remember to back up your data and proceed with caution.

Happy rooting!

Most OEMs are now openly embracing the Android development community and Motorola is no different. After years of locking the bootloader on their devices, the company now offers an official bootloader unlock tool, which makes it easy for developers and users alike to tinker with their Moto devices.

Step 2: Reboot your device into fastboot mode by pressing the Volume down + Power button at the same time. Now, connect it to your PC and enter the following commands in the Command prompt or terminal window opened in the previous step:
