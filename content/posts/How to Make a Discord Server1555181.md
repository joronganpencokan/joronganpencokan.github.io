Title: 1 Simple Trick to Create Your Dream Discord Server & Wow Your Friends!

If you're a gamer, anime fan, or even someone who loves to chat and connect with like-minded people, you've probably heard of Discord. Discord is a chat app that has gained a massive following in recent years as it offers a plethora of features that allow you to communicate and share things with other gamers, anime enthusiasts, or just connect with your friends.

Running a Discord server can be a little tricky, particularly if you're just getting started with it. You may have a lot of doubts about what to do, how to organize things, how to make the server fun, and how to create something remarkable that everyone will love. The good news is that there's one simple trick that can help you create your dream Discord server and wow your friends.

The trick is to create a theme for your Discord server. A theme can make a significant difference in how people interact with your server. It can also help you create a positive and engaging atmosphere that encourages people to contribute and participate.

Here are some simple steps that can help you create a theme for your Discord server:

Step 1: Choose a theme

The first thing you need to do is choose a theme for your Discord server. The theme can be anything from a game, anime, TV show, or anything that interests you and your friends. You can also choose a general theme that encompasses a broader category of interests.

Step 2: Assign roles

Once you've chosen a theme, you'll need to assign roles to your server members. Roles can help you organize things and create a hierarchy or system of ranks. For instance, you could assign a role to moderators, admins, or even patrons, depending on your server's type and requirements.

Step 3: Create channels

Now that you've assigned roles, you can create channels that cater to the theme of your server. For example, if you've chosen a gaming theme, you can create a channel for game reviews, one for multiplayer games, and one for game promotions.

Step 4: Customize your server

Customizing your server is crucial to making it stand out and look fantastic. You can add an image, change the server banner, and even create custom emojis that go with your theme. You want to make sure that your server looks professional, engaging, and fun.

In conclusion

Creating a theme for your Discord server is the easiest way to make sure that everyone is on the same page and that your server has a particular vibe or style. Additionally, it can also help you create a more welcoming and friendly space where people can discuss and share their interests without feeling left out or out of place.

So if you're looking to create your dream Discord server, try out this simple trick and see how it keeps your friends interested and engaged.

##   How to Make Roles in Discord  
 

Roles in Discord are essential to make sure that you have some amount of control over your server. You can set as many types as you like. Typically, you'll find roles like Administrator, Moderator, Member, and others like that. Each has its own set of permissions for actions they're allowed and not allowed to take.

 
- To set up roles in your Discord server, right-click the icon for your server in the bar to the left.
 - You can also get into settings by clicking on the icon for your server and clicking the down arrow next to your server name.
 - Click Server Settings > Roles.
 - By default, all servers have one role called @everyone, which lets you assign permissions to all server members. To add a role, click the + next to Roles.
 - Change the name under Role name. From there, you can change any permissions you'd like for the new role. Once done, click Save Changes at the bottom of the screen.
 - Discord will not allow you to close the new role box until you have saved your name and permissions.

 

You can set up multiple roles and different permissions for each one this way. The @everyone role will be the default role for new members as they join the server.

##   How to Assign Roles to New Users

- Click the name of person whose role you want to change.
 - Click the + under No Roles.
 - Select the role you want to assign.

 
##   Managing Roles in Discord  
 

You may decide at some point that you're micromanaging your users too much. You can easily delete the roles you created in Discord.

 

Click the name of person whose role you want to change.

 

Click the + under No Roles.

 

Select the role you want to assign.

 
- Right-click the server icon on the left.
 - Click Server Settings > Roles.
 - Click the role you want to delete and scroll all the way to the bottom of the screen. Click Delete.
 - You can only delete the roles that you created. You cannot remove those created by bots. If the delete button is missing, a bot likely made it.

 
##   Some Notes About Roles  
 

There are some essential things to know about roles in Discord. Users can have multiple roles. For example, a user can be a moderator and an admin. Each one can grant different permissions depending on what you set. If a user has no assigned roles, they'll get the permissions assigned to the @everyone role.

 

Right-click the server icon on the left.

 

Click the role you want to delete and scroll all the way to the bottom of the screen. Click Delete.

 
You can only delete the roles that you created. You cannot remove those created by bots. If the delete button is missing, a bot likely made it.
 

Roles can only be manually assigned to users one user at a time. If you remove one with 900 users and then change your mind, you'll need to reassign 900 users one at a time. Bots can help with this. Some services that integrate with Discord, like Patreon, use bots to auto-assign roles to users.
