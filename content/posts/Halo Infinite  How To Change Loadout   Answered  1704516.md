Halo Infinite is the newest addition to the Halo franchise, with much anticipation leading up to its release in December 2021. The game takes players on a journey through a vast open-world environment, with exhilarating multiplayer gameplay, intense firefights, and a range of weapons that are unique to the game. One of the key aspects of Halo Infinite's gameplay is the ability to customize your loadout, selecting weapons and equipment that suit your gameplay style and give you an edge over your opponents.

Here are some tips and tricks for changing your loadout in Halo Infinite:

1. Understand the strengths of each weapon: One of the key elements of customizing your loadout is understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon in the game. Take some time to experiment with different weapons to find the ones that work best for your preferred gameplay style. For example, if you like to play defensively, you may want to choose weapons with a long-range, such as the Sniper Rifle or Battle Rifle.

2. Customize your armor abilities: In Halo Infinite, players have the ability to equip armor abilities that give them special powers and advantages on the battlefield. These abilities range from boosting your movement speed to granting you temporary invincibility. Take the time to experiment with different armor abilities to find the ones that work best for you.

3. Choose the right grenades: Different grenades have different effects on the battlefield, and choosing the right ones can give you a significant advantage over your opponents. For example, the Plasma Grenade can stick to an opponent, causing significant damage, while the Pulse Grenade creates a damaging energy field.

4. Be aware of your surroundings: Knowing the map and the layout of the battlefield is crucial in Halo Infinite. Take the time to learn the areas where weapons and power-ups spawn, and use this knowledge to your advantage when deciding which loadout to choose.

5. Experiment with different loadouts: Don't be afraid to experiment with different loadouts to find the ones that work best for you. Mix and match different weapons and abilities until you find the perfect combination that suits your playstyle.

In conclusion, by understanding the strengths of each weapon, customizing your armor abilities, choosing the right grenades, being aware of your surroundings, and experimenting with different loadouts, you'll be well on your way to unlocking the ultimate gaming edge in Halo Infinite. Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to loadouts – it's all about finding the combination of weapons and abilities that work best for you.

## How to Swap Loadouts in Halo Infinite? (Answered)
 

 
If you’ve been looking forward to changing loadouts in Halo Infinite, you’ll be disappointed to know that you can’t. While previous editions of Halo offered the ability to change and switch loadouts mid-game, Infinite does not. This means that you can only make use of the weapons that you find by yourself during games.
 
Instead, what you do get is a common weapon to start with during each game. Once a round begins, you will need to hunt the map for weapons strewn across, in different nooks and crannies. While changing loadouts can be fun, hunting for top-tier weapons is actually much more interesting. The unexpectedness of chancing upon an Assault Rifle mid-game.
 
With that being said, you also need to remember that you can only use one weapon at a time. When you do chance upon a new gun that you want to use, you will need to give up your current weapon. To be fair, this does sound like a decent trade-off, especially considering you can acquire some pretty amazing weapons.
 
While there is no option to change loadouts, there is a possibility the developers may add this feature sometime later. This, however, is just speculative for now.
