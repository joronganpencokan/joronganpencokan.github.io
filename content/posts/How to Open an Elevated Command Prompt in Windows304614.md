When it comes to executing administrative commands on a Windows operating system, nothing beats the power and versatility of the elevated command prompt. This hidden gem of the Windows command line allows users to perform advanced system maintenance tasks, modify critical registry settings, and troubleshoot complex issues with ease.

But how do you open an elevated command prompt and harness its full potential? In this article, we'll show you how to unlock Windows' secret weapon by learning how to open an elevated command prompt like a pro!

Step 1: Understanding User Account Control (UAC)

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of opening an elevated command prompt, it's important to understand the role of User Account Control (UAC). UAC is a security feature in Windows that helps prevent unauthorized changes to the system. When UAC is enabled, every time you try to perform an administrative task, the system will prompt you to confirm your actions.

While UAC is a useful feature that helps keep your system secure, it can sometimes get in the way of performing certain tasks. This is where the elevated command prompt comes into play.

Step 2: Using the Start Menu to Open an Elevated Command Prompt

The easiest way to open an elevated command prompt is to use the Start menu. Here's how:

1. Click the Start button.
2. Type "cmd" in the search bar.
3. Right-click on "Command Prompt."
4. Select "Run as administrator."

Voila! You now have an elevated command prompt open and ready to use.

Step 3: Using Keyboard Shortcuts to Open an Elevated Command Prompt

If you're a fan of keyboard shortcuts, you'll be pleased to know that there's a shortcut for opening an elevated command prompt as well. Here's how:

1. Press the Windows key + X.
2. Select "Command Prompt (Admin)" from the menu.

That's it! You now have an elevated command prompt opened using the Windows keyboard shortcut.

Step 4: Using the Run Dialog Box to Open an Elevated Command Prompt

If you prefer to use the Run dialog box to open applications, you can also use it to open an elevated command prompt.

1. Press the Windows key + R.
2. Type "cmd" in the dialog box.
3. Press Ctrl + Shift + Enter.

You've successfully opened an elevated command prompt using the Run dialog box.

Step 5: Pinning an Elevated Command Prompt to the Start Menu or Taskbar

Last but not least, if you use the elevated command prompt often, you can pin it to the Start menu or taskbar for easy access. Here's how:

1. Open the Start menu or taskbar.
2. Right-click on "Command Prompt (Admin)."
3. Select "Pin to Start" or "Pin to Taskbar."

Now you have an elevated command prompt shortcut at your fingertips, ready to use whenever you need it.

Conclusion

The elevated command prompt is a powerful tool that can help you perform advanced administrative tasks on your Windows operating system. By following these simple steps, you can open an elevated command prompt like a pro and take advantage of all the functionalities it offers. So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and unleash the full potential of your Windows operating system!

If you're using a keyboard with Windows 11, Windows 10, or Windows 8, you can open an elevated Command Prompt quickly from the Power User Menu. Just use the WIN+X keyboard shortcut and then select Terminal (Admin) (in Windows 11) or Command Prompt (Admin) (in Windows 10/8). Choose Yes on any User Account Control messages that might appear.

 
- Open Task Manager. The quickest way, assuming you're using a keyboard, is via CTRL+SHIFT+ESC but there are several other methods outlined in that link. One easy way is to type the app name into Cortana's search field.
 - Select Run new task at the top (Windows 11), or go to File > Run new task.
 - Don't see the File menu? You may first have to select More details at the bottom of the Task Manager window to show a more advanced view of the program, including the File menu.
 - In the Create new task window you see now, type the following in the Open text field:
 - cmd
 - ...but don't do anything else just yet!
 - Check the Create this task with administrative privileges. box.
 - Don't see this box? That means that your Windows account is a standard account, not an administrator account.

Feel free to close Task Manager. It does not need to remain open to use Command Prompt.

 
Depending on your settings and Windows configuration, Command Prompt may be replaced by Windows Powershell. If you're using Windows 11, the option in the Power User Menu is for Terminal; you can get to Command Prompt after opening that program.

##   When Do You Need an Elevated Command Prompt?  
 

Some commands available in Windows require that you run them from an elevated Command Prompt. Basically, this means running the Command Prompt program (cmd.exe) with administrator-level privileges.

 

You'll know if you need to run a particular command from within an elevated Command Prompt because it'll clearly tell you that in an error message after running the command.

 

For example, when you try to execute the sfc command from a normal Command Prompt window, you'll get the "You must be an administrator running a console session in order to use the sfc utility" message.

 

Try the chkdsk command and you'll get an "Access Denied as you do not have sufficient privileges or the disk may be locked by another process. You have to invoke this utility running in elevated mode and make sure the disk is unlocked" error.

 

Other commands give other messages, but regardless of how the message is phrased, or what Command Prompt command we're talking about, the solution is simple: open an elevated Command Prompt and execute the command again.

 
##   More About Elevated Command Prompts  
 

Don't let all the discussion above convince you that you should, or need to, run Command Prompt as an administrator for most commands. For almost all Command Prompt commands, no matter what version of Windows, it's perfectly okay to execute them from a standard Command Prompt window.

 

To be able to open an elevated Command Prompt window, either a) your Windows user account must already have administrator privileges, or b) you must know the password to another account on the computer that has administrator privileges. Most home computer user's accounts are set up as administrator accounts, so this isn't usually a concern.

 
##   How to Tell if You Have Administrator Privileges  
 

There's a very easy way to tell if the Command Prompt window you've opened is elevated or not: it's elevated if the window title says Administrator; it's not elevated if the window title just says Command Prompt.

 

An elevated Command Prompt window opens to the system32 folder. A non-elevated Command Prompt window instead opens to the user's folder: C:\Users\[username].

 

If you plan on frequently using an elevated Command Prompt then you should consider creating a new shortcut to Command Prompt that automatically starts the program with administrator-level access. See How to Create an Elevated Command Prompt Shortcut if you need help.

 

In Windows XP, users have Administrator privileges by default. When you open a Command Prompt in XP it will be elevated unless you have another type of profile.
