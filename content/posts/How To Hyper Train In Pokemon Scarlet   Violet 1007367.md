As a Pokemon trainer, you always want to get the best out of your Pokemon. You want them to be strong, fast, and powerful enough to take on any challengers that come their way. However, even the most powerful Pokemon can benefit from hyper training. That's why we've put together the ultimate hyper training guide for Pokemon Scarlet Violet. 

Hyper training is a feature introduced in Pokemon Sun and Moon and has become a staple in subsequent Pokemon games, including Pokemon Scarlet Violet. Its purpose is to enhance a Pokemon's individual strengths and make them even more formidable. Here's how to do it:

## Step 1: Obtain Bottle Caps

To hyper train a Pokemon, you first need to obtain Bottle Caps. These rare items can be found throughout the game, but they are usually hard to come by. Luckily, there are a few ways to obtain them:

- **BP Shop:** Bottle Caps can be purchased from the Battle Points (BP) Shop for 50 BP. You can earn BP by participating in various activities such as battling trainers, participating in the Battle Tower, and more.

- **Isle Evelup:** Another way to obtain Bottle Caps is by growing berries on Isle Evelup on Poké Pelago. Berries harvested on the island can be exchanged for Bottle Caps by the NPC on the island.

- **Trading with other players:** If you know other players who have Bottle Caps, you can trade with them to get some. 

## Step 2: Choose a Pokemon to Hyper Train

After obtaining Bottle Caps, you need to select a Pokemon to hyper train. Not all Pokemon can be hyper-trained, so make sure the Pokemon you want to train is eligible. To qualify for hyper training, a Pokemon must have reached level 100. 

## Step 3: Hyper Train Your Pokemon

Once you have identified the Pokemon you want to hyper-train and have obtained Bottle Caps, head to the good old lady in the Battle Tree on Poni Island. Talk to her and select the "Hyper Training" option. This action will open up the "Hyper Training" menu. From there, select the Pokemon you want to hyper train and choose the stat you want to improve.

To increase a stat, you will need to use a Bottle Cap for that stat. Each Bottle Cap enhances only one stat, so choose carefully. Once you select the stat, you will use up a Bottle Cap and give the selected Pokemon a permanent stat boost to that hyper-trained stat. 

## Conclusion

Hyper training is an excellent way to build a powerful team in Pokemon Scarlet Violet. It can help you take on any challenge, whether you're battling other trainers, participating in the Battle Tower, or taking on the Elite Four. However, Bottle Caps can be quite challenging to obtain, and hyper training only affects one stat at a time. So, use them wisely, and make sure to select the right Pokemon carefully. With this guide, you can unlock the insane power of your Pokemon in no time. Happy training!

As you progress through the main story or make your way through Paldea in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, you are bound to come up against tougher opponents. And at times, the strongest Pokemon on your team would also be outperformed. If that happens, it’s probably time for you to look towards Hyper Training. This can help your Pokemon come out even or even surpass the opponent’s total strength. Here’s all you need to know about Hyper Training in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet.
 
## How to Hyper Train in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet
 
Hyper Training is a rigorous mechanism that allows you to train your Pokemon to its highest IV (Individual Value). Keep in mind that this can be done only if your Pokemon is above Level 50. To Hyper Train, you’ll need Bottle Caps. These are currencies which can be exchanged with an NPC to start the Hyper Training. You’ll need six Bottle Caps if you want to upgrade the IV of their HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed. More on that later but first, we’ll show you where you can find Bottle Caps:
 
### How to Get Bottle Caps in Pokemon SV
 
There are primarily four ways to get Bottle Caps in the game:
 
- After you earn six Gym Badges, you will be able to purchase them from the Delibird Presents in Mesagoza for 20K Poke Dollars each.
 - You can find them among the items dropped after completing four-star or higher Tera Raids
 - Buy them via auctions in Porto Marinada
 - Reward for participating in the Academy Ace Tournament

 
There is another type of Bottle Cap in Pokemon SV known as Gold Bottle Caps, but these are extremely rare. They can be found at auctions in Porto Marinada but make sure to have enough money in the bank. Another alternative is finding them at the Academy Ace Tournament, which is again, a rare find.

### Where to Hyper Train in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
 
Once you collect the Bottle Caps, simply head towards the north of the Great Crater of Paldea. Here, in the Glaseado Mountain, you’ll find the Montenevera Pokemon Centre. You can find an NPC with a brown jacket and black sunglasses who will help you max your Pokemon’s IV. Approach him and simply exchange a Bottle Cap to raise an IV of your choice. If you have a Gold Bottle Cap, you could raise all 6 IV’s in one go. Alternatively, you can also trade 6 Bottle Caps. Once that’s done, your Pokemon’s Hyper Training will now be completed.
