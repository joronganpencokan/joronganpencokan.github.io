## Installing Mee6

The first step in using Mee6 is to add it to your Discord server. Here's what you need to do:

1. Visit the Mee6 website at [https://mee6.xyz/](https://mee6.xyz/) and click "Add to Discord."

2. Choose the server you want to add Mee6 to from the dropdown menu and click "Authorize."

3. Follow the prompts to give Mee6 the necessary permissions to access your server.

Once you've completed these steps, Mee6 will be added to your server and ready to use!

## Basic Commands

Mee6 comes with several basic commands that you can use right out of the box. Here are some of the most useful ones:

- `!rank` - Shows the rank and XP of a user.
- `!ban` - Bans a user from the server.
- `!kick` - Kicks a user from the server.
- `!clear` - Deletes a specified number of messages from the channel.

To use these commands, simply type them into the chat followed by any necessary parameters. For example, to ban a user from your server, you would type `!ban @username` and replace "username" with the actual username of the person you want to ban.

## Custom Commands

One of the coolest things about Mee6 is that you can create your own custom commands. These can be anything you want, from a simple response to a specific question to a more complex command that performs several actions at once.

Here's how to create a custom command:

1. Type `!commands` into the chat to access the Mee6 command menu.

2. Click "Create Command."

3. Choose the trigger word or phrase that will activate the command.

4. Enter the response you want Mee6 to give when the command is activated.

5. Click "Create Command" to save your custom command.

Now, whenever someone types the trigger word or phrase into the chat, Mee6 will respond with the message you entered. This is a great way to create a sense of community and add some personality to your server!

## Automations

Another powerful feature of Mee6 is its ability to automate certain tasks. For example, you can set up Mee6 to give users a role when they reach a certain level of XP, or to send a message to the chat at specific intervals.

Here's how to set up an automation:

1. Type `!levels` into the chat to access the Mee6 level menu.

2. Click "Add Role" and choose the role you want to assign to users who reach a certain level.

3. Set the desired level at which the role will be assigned.

4. Click "Save" to create the automation.

Now, whenever a user reaches the designated level, Mee6 will automatically assign them the role you chose. This can be a great way to reward active members of your community and encourage engagement on your server.

## Conclusion

Mee6 is a powerful tool that can help you transform your Discord server into a vibrant, active community. With its customizable commands, automations, and integrations with other services like YouTube and Twitch, Mee6 is the ultimate companion for anyone serious about building a strong online presence.

So why not give Mee6 a try? With a little bit of setup and some creative thinking, you can create a Discord server that truly stands out from the crowd!
