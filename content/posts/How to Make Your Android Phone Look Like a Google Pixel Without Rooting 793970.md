Google Pixel phones run stock Android with minimal customizations as to give users the purest Android experience possible. In contrast, a lot of Android phones come with customized skin (such as MIUI, One UI, and ColorOS etc) which tend to irritate a lot of users. While you can’t change these skins without rooting, you can still make your Android phone look like a Google Pixel, with the help of a few third-party apps, widgets, and launchers. It’s pretty easy to do, so follow along in this guide to learn how.
 
## Advantages of the Google Pixel Interface
 
The good thing about a Pixel phone is that Google has included many Android features exclusively for Pixel phones.
 
For example, While Android 12 brought Material You (Google’s new unified design language that lets users redesign the look and feel of their phones) into the wild, only the Pixel smartphones are able to fully take advantage of its capabilities.
 
In addition, the customizations on Pixel phones are mild and Google does not mess with the overall look of stock Android. This makes it cleaner without any bloat.
 
## Things to Know Before Turning Your Android Phone into a Pixel
 
For the purpose of this article we used a device running Android 10 and also tested the apps on Android 11 and 12 devices. All worked fine, but during our testing we noticed some delay in the animations after switching to the new launcher. Also, the battery consumption of the device increased significantly after setting up the launcher and icon packs.
 
Note: Some Android phones, especially lower-end models, don’t have enough resources to maintain the load of an extra launcher. So, you might experience considerable slow down. In case you’re seeing something similar, consider switching back to your phone’s default launcher.
 
## 1. Download and Install a Third-Party Launcher
 
The first thing to make your phone look and feel like a Pixel device is changing the launch screen. While there are plenty of homescreen launcher in the Play store, we recommend using Lawnchair 2 because it’s the closest to Pixel experience you can get.
 
- Install the Lawnchair 2 app from Play Store.Head over to the “Settings” and navigate to find “Apps” or “App Management”.

 
- Tap on “Default Apps”.

 
- Now tap on “Home app”. Select Lawnchair from the list and set it as the default home app.

 
Note: The screenshots and steps might not be the same as what you see on your device. Search in your phone’s settings for the options described in the steps if you can’t follow along.
 
With Lawnchair as the default launcher, you’ll see that it has a UI very similar to the Pixel launcher. It has a bottom search bar menu, date, time, event widget at the top, and a pixel-like search bar in the app drawer.
 
If you want to tweak things further, tap and hold on the homescreen and go to Settings. You’ll find every possible customization option, like changing the theme, dock style, search engine, and also install a different icon pack.
 
## 2. Install a Material-Based Icon Pack
 
In Android 12, Pixels feature a monochrome icon app pack with accents based on the wallpaper’s colors. Fortunately, you can easily recreate the Pixel iconography using various third-party icon packs from the Play Store.
 
There are both paid and free icon packs available. If you are willing to spend a few dollars, you can download an app called Pix Material You Icons. It is an adaptive icon pack that is designed to automatically change colors based on your wallpaper and theme (dark or light). It supports many more themed icons than what Google offers but the theming only works on smartphones running Android 12.
 
Alternatively, you can download Pix You Android 12, which is absolutely free to use. It supports over 6600 popular app icons and looks very similar to the Pixel icons. Best of all, it even works on devices that are running Android 11 or older.
 
Once you’ve downloaded and install the icon pack, set it as default from Lawnchair settings. To do it follow these steps:
 
- Open Lawnchair’s Settings app from the app drawer.Tap on “Theme”.Select “Icon Packs” from there.

 
- Now drag up the downloaded icon pack to enable it.

 
### Change Your Android’s Icon Shapes
 
The next thing you can do is to change the icon shapes. Here’s how to do it:
 
- Open the Lawnchair settings and tap on “Theme”.

 
- Tap on “Icon Shape” and set it as “Circle”.

 
- Next, head back to “Theme” and tap “More Settings”.

 
- Turn on “Create Adaptive Icons”, “Create Adaptive Icons for Icon Pack”, and “Color Backgrounds”.

 
- Now you can see that the app icons have gained accent-colored icons and look pretty similar to the calm and beautiful monochrome icons of a Pixel.

 
## 3. Get the Google Feed
 
Pixel smartphones have a feature called Google Discover. With this feature on, users can access a custom Google feed with just one swipe from the homescreen. It is pretty similar to the feed of the Google App.
 
The Google Feed feature is available as a plugin for Lawnfeed. It’s not enabled by default and needs to installed manually. To enable Google feed, you’ll need to sideload an application in. apk format called Lawnfeed:
 
- Go to the Lawnchair Dowloads page to download the “Lawnfeed.3.apk” file. Tap on the apk file to install it on your phone.Next, open Lawnchair’s Settings app from the App drawer.Navigate to find “Plugins” and tap.

 
- Now toggle the “Show Google App Feed” option and you’ll be good to go.

 
## 4. Set Google Wallpapers
 
Your smartphone will not look as aesthetically pleasing as the Pixel phone if you don’t use the default Google or Pixel wallpapers. Thankfully, you can download stock wallpapers directly from Google’s Wallpapers app. In case you don’t want any more applications on your phone, you can visit a site like WallpaperAccess to download some cool Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro wallpapers for your device.
