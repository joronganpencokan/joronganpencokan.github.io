# Revive Your Slow Computer in 2020 – Learn How to Fix Windows Registry Errors Now!

Are you tired of waiting for your computer to start up, open programs, or complete tasks? Is your computer's performance slower than it used to be? If so, chances are, your computer is suffering from Windows registry errors. 

The Windows registry is a hierarchical database that stores information about a computer's configuration. Over time, this database can become cluttered with invalid entries, broken links, and other errors, causing your computer to slow down or even crash. 

But the good news is, you can fix these errors and revive your computer's performance. Here's how to fix Windows registry errors and improve your computer's speed.

## Step 1: Back Up Your Registry

Before making any changes to your registry, it's important to back it up. This way, if something goes wrong, you can easily restore your registry to its previous state. 

To back up your registry, simply open the Registry Editor by typing "regedit" in the Windows search bar. Once it opens, select "Computer" and then click on "File" and "Export." Choose a location to save the backup file, and click "Save."

## Step 2: Identify and Fix Errors

Now that your registry is backed up, it's time to identify and fix errors. One way to do this is to use a third-party registry cleaner, such as CCleaner, Auslogics Registry Cleaner, or Wise Registry Cleaner. These programs scan your registry for errors, such as invalid entries, broken links, and missing file extensions, and then fix them automatically.

Alternatively, you can identify and fix errors manually. To do this, open the Registry Editor and navigate to the key that's causing problems. For example, if an application isn't working properly, you may need to delete its registry key and then reinstall the application. But before making any changes, be sure to research the key and its function to avoid causing further problems.

## Step 3: Defrag Your Hard Drive

After cleaning up your registry, it's a good idea to defragment your hard drive. Over time, files on your computer become fragmented, which means they're spread out across the hard drive, making it harder for your computer to access them quickly. 

To defrag your hard drive, simply open the Disk Defragmenter tool by typing "defrag" in the Windows search bar. Once it opens, select the drive you want to defrag and click "Optimize." The tool will then analyze the drive and move files so they're stored in a more efficient way.

## Step 4: Uninstall Unused Programs

Another way to speed up your computer is to uninstall any programs you no longer use. These programs take up valuable space on your hard drive and can slow down your computer, even if you're not using them. 

To uninstall programs, simply go to the Control Panel and select "Programs and Features." Then, select the program you want to uninstall and click "Uninstall." Follow the prompts to complete the uninstall process.

## Step 5: Update Your Drivers

Finally, it's important to keep your drivers up to date. Drivers are software that allow your computer to communicate with hardware devices, such as your printer or graphics card. If your drivers are outdated, your computer may experience performance problems. 

To update your drivers, simply go to the Device Manager by typing "device manager" in the Windows search bar. Once it opens, select the hardware device you want to update, right-click on it, and select "Update driver." If Windows doesn't find an updated driver, you may need to visit the device manufacturer's website to download one.

By following these steps, you can fix Windows registry errors, defrag your hard drive, uninstall unused programs, and update your drivers to revive your slow computer in 2020. Try it out and see the difference in speed and performance!
