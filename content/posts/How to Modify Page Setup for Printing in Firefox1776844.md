Are you tired of printing web pages that come out looking frustratingly different from what you see on screen? Well, there is a secret printing hack in Firefox that allows you to unleash the ultimate page setup modifier and get the printout that you desire.

Firefox is a powerful browser that has continually evolved to be user-friendly, and with this printing hack, it has now become even more versatile. It's an ingenious method that lets you modify the page setup settings of Firefox to adjust margins, change orientation, add or remove headers and footers, and much more.

Are you wondering how to unlock this printing hack? Well, it's pretty simple. Begin by opening the Firefox browser and go to the page you want to print. Then, click on the menu button (the three horizontal lines) and select the Print option. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+P" in Windows or "Cmd+P" in macOS.

Once you've done that, it's time to unleash the secret printing hack. Look for the section that says "Margins & Header/Footer" and click on the "Page Setup" button right next to it. It's located in the bottom-left corner.

Voila! This is where the magic happens. A new page setup window will pop up, allowing you to modify various settings to your preferences. The page setup window has four tabs:

- Margins
- Header/Footer
- Paper Size
- Orientation

Under the Margins tab, you can adjust the page margins. You can set the units (inches or millimeters), modify the top, bottom, left, and right margins or choose a preset margin layout.

Under the Header/Footer tab, you can add or remove headers or footers, modify their fonts, and add page numbers, date, time, and URLs to them.

Under the Paper Size tab, you can choose from the most common paper sizes. Still, you can also add custom paper sizes, change their orientation, or scale the image to fit within the paper size.

Lastly, under the Orientation tab, you can change the printout orientation from portrait to landscape, and vice versa.

Once you've adjusted all the settings to your preference, click on the OK button, go back to the print preview, and hit Print. You'll now have a printout that's exactly how you want it, with the desired margins, orientation, and headers/footers. 

This printing hack works on any website and comes in handy when printing online documents, receipts, invoices, or anything you need to print. It's a simple yet powerful technique that can save you printing headaches and paper, and it's something every Firefox user should know.

In conclusion, Firefox offers more than just a browsing experience; it has hidden features that can significantly boost your productivity. The hidden printing hack can modify page setups to your liking, giving you the ultimate control over your printouts. So next time you need to print from Firefox, remember to unleash the secret printing hack!

This article explains how to modify the page setup for printing in the Firefox browser. Instructions apply to the Mozilla Firefox web browser on the Windows, Mac OS X, macOS Sierra, and Linux operating systems.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- In the Firefox browser, select Menu > Print. In Print Preview, you can modify the page's orientation and scale.Select Options to change the look of the printed page, such as customizing the Header/Footer.

 
##   Find the Print Command  
 

First, open the Firefox browser. In the upper-right corner, select Menu (three horizontal lines). When the pop-out menu appears, choose the Print option.

 
##   Orientation  
 

Firefox's Print Preview interface should now be displayed in a new window, showing what the active page will look like when it is sent to the designated printer or to a file.

 

At the top of this interface are multiple buttons and drop-down menus, including the ability to choose either Portrait or Landscape for print orientation.

 

If Portrait (the default option) is selected, the page prints in the standard vertical format. If Landscape is selected, the page prints in horizontal format, commonly used when the default mode is not sufficient to fit some of the page contents.

 
##   Scale  
 

Located directly to the left of the Orientation options is the Scale setting, accompanied by a drop-down menu. Here you can modify the dimensions of a page for printing purposes. For example, by modifying the value to 50%, the page prints at a scale of half the original page.

 

By default, the Shrink To Fit option is selected. When activated, the browser prints the page so that the web page is modified to fit the width of the printing paper. If you are interested in altering the scale value manually, select the drop-down menu, and choose the Custom option.

 

Also found in this interface is a button labeled Page Setup, which launches a dialog containing several print-related options that are split into two sections: Format & Options and Margins & Header/Footer.

 
##   Options  
 

The Options tab contains several options to change the look of the printed page, including an option accompanied by a check box labeled Print Background (colors & images). When printing a page, Firefox doesn't automatically include background colors and images. This is by design since most people want to print only text and foreground images.

 

If you want to print the entire contents of a page, including the background, select the box next to this option once so that it contains a check mark.

 
###   Header and Footer  
 

Under Options, Firefox also gives you the ability to customize the headers and footers of a print job in several ways. Information can be placed in the left corner, the center, and the right corner on the top (header) and bottom (footer) of the page. Any of the following items, selected from the drop-down menu, can be placed in any or all of the six locations provided.

 
- blank: If selected, nothing is shown.
 - Title: The title of the page is shown.
 - URL: The entire URL of the page is shown.
 - Date/Time: The current date and time are shown.
 - Page #: The page number (for example, 3) of the current print job is shown.
 - Page # of #: Similar to Page #, this displays the number of the current page and the total number of pages in the current print job (for example, 1 of 2).
 - Custom: When this is selected, a message prompts you to enter custom text to be printed. This option can be useful in certain situations.
