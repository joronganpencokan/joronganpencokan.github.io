# Unleash Supernatural Powers: The Ultimate Guide to Boosting Your Spells in Elden Ring!

Elden Ring is one of the most anticipated games of 2022, a collaboration between FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin, the bestselling author of A Song of Ice and Fire. The game promises to be a dark and mysterious fantasy adventure, set in a world where magic and technology collide.

As a player, you will have access to a wide array of spells and magical abilities, which will be essential to survive the dangers of Elden Ring. However, just learning spells won't be enough. To truly unleash the powers of magic, you need to learn how to boost your spells and make them more potent.

Here are some tips to help you boost your spells in Elden Ring:

## 1. Invest in your attributes

In Elden Ring, your attributes will determine your character's abilities and the effectiveness of your spells. Therefore, it's essential to invest in the attributes that will contribute to your magic's potency.

For example, Intelligence and Faith will be crucial for sorcerers and clerics, respectively. These attributes will increase your spellcasting abilities and allow you to use more powerful spells. Similarly, Vitality, Endurance, and Stamina will be significant for all characters, as they will increase your character's survivability and allow you to cast more spells without running out of mana.

## 2. Equip the right gear

In Elden Ring, your character's gear will play a vital role in their combat effectiveness, including their magic. Therefore, it's essential to equip the right gear to maximize your spellcasting abilities.

Some gear, such as rings and amulets, will provide you with additional magical bonuses, such as increased spell damage or reduced mana consumption. Other gear, such as staffs and chimes, will allow you to cast spells more quickly or with more range.

Therefore, it's crucial to choose your gear based on your playstyle and the spells you use the most. If you're a sorcerer, you'll want to equip spellcasting gear that emphasizes Intelligence and spell damage. Similarly, if you're a cleric, you'll want gear that emphasizes Faith and miracle damage.

## 3. Improve your skills

In Elden Ring, your skills will determine your proficiency in different types of weapons and spells. As you use them more, your skills will improve, making your spells more potent.

Therefore, it's essential to practice your spells regularly and invest in the skills that are most important to your playstyle. For example, if you're a sorcerer, you'll want to focus on improving your magic skills such as sorcery, pyromancy, and hexes.

Similarly, if you're a cleric, you'll want to focus on improving your miracle skills such as healing spells, lightning damage, and defensive spells.

## 4. Use spell enhancers

In Elden Ring, you will encounter items called spell enhancers that can significantly boost your spells' potency. These enhancers can be a crucial tool in your toolkit, allowing you to defeat enemies that may be otherwise challenging.

For example, some spell enhancers may increase your spell's damage, while others may increase their range or speed. Similarly, some spell enhancers may improve the healing ability of your miracles, making them more potent.

Therefore, it's essential to seek out spell enhancers and use them as needed to overcome difficult challenges and enemies.

## Conclusion

Boosting your spells in Elden Ring is essential to survive the dangers of the game world. By investing in your attributes, equipping the right gear, improving your skills, and using spell enhancers, you can unleash the supernatural powers of your spells and overcome any challenge that comes your way.

With these tips, you're well on your way to becoming a master of magic in Elden Ring!
