# Shocking Revelation: Goose Goose Duck Knocks Among Us Off Top Spot - You Won't Believe Why!

The gaming world has experienced a tremendous shift in dominance over the past few weeks. For a while, Among Us was the undisputed king of the castle, nestled comfortably in its spot as the most played game on Steam. However, a new game has emerged to dethrone the impostor-riddled hit - Goose Goose Duck.

It's a surprising and unexpected turn of events, and many gamers are struggling to come to terms with the shift. But we've delved into the reasons why Goose Goose Duck has become this season's hotshot, and the answers are truly astonishing.

Firstly, Goose Goose Duck takes the core principles of Among Us and expands on them. In Goose Goose Duck, players take on the roles of geese and ducks instead of space travelers. Each round, players are assigned roles like thief, medic, detective, and more. The gameplay is similar to Among Us; players need to complete tasks while a few hidden traitors try to sabotage the team. However, Goose Goose Duck has added many new gameplay features, including different maps, custom characters, pet animals, and unique game modes that put a fresh spin on the traitor formula.

Secondly, the developers of Goose Goose Duck have been quick to address player feedback and actively implement changes. Players provide detailed feedback on Reddit and Discord, which the developers carefully analyze and make changes accordingly. They're open to player suggestions and frequently update the game, fixing glitches, and adding new content. This approach has created a loyal and enthusiastic fanbase that feels heard and valued.

Thirdly, Goose Goose Duck has leveraged social media platforms like Twitch and YouTube to spread the word about their game. Many popular streamers, including PewDiePie, Pokimane, and Jacksepticeye, have played Goose Goose Duck and generated millions of views. This tactic has brought the game to the attention of a vast audience and propelled it to new heights of popularity.

Lastly, one of the significant reasons for Goose Goose Duck's success is its community. The game's Discord server is full of welcoming, supportive fans who help new players learn the ropes and make friends. They host tournaments, events, and frequently create content for the game, spreading the word and promoting it further.

In conclusion, Goose Goose Duck has risen to prominence because of its innovative approach to the traitor genre, responsive and caring developers, strategic use of social media, and a supportive and growing community. The game has knocked Among Us off its perch, and it's not difficult to see why. As Goose Goose Duck continues to improve and gain an ever-increasing following, all eyes are now towards what the future holds for this plucky little game.

Goose Goose Duck is an indie social deduction game that has become quite viral in recent times. Ever since its release, the community has been quick to draw out its similarities with Among Us. And several players even stated it to be a clone of Among Us. But concluding which game is better to play with friends can be a tad bit confusing. Not to worry, we have compiled some factors to weigh in to help you out. So, check out our guide for a complete comparison of Goose Goose Duck Vs Among Us.
 
## Goose Goose Duck Vs Among Us – Which is Better?
 
As mentioned earlier, we will be mentioning several factors to discuss their pros and cons. So, here are some factors to consider in deciding which game is better:
 
### Voice Chat Support
 
You need to install mods or a third-party app like Discord to communicate with your friends in Among Us.  But speaking of Goose Goose Duck, it features in-game Voice chat Support that you can use. The Goose Goose Duck also has proximity chat that you can use to overhear any suss conversations among the group. Although if you are a Duck, we recommend turning it Off to avoid someone from hearing something suspicious.
 
Furthermore, you can also connect to Discord from the Main menu in Goose Goose Duck. So, you don’t have to worry about connecting with your friends anyway.
 
### More Game Modes
 
In total, Goose Goose Duck has 5 built-in game modes for players to play with their friends. This includes the Classic+, Classic, Dine & Dash, Goose Hunt, and Trick or Treat. On the other hand, Among Us has only two game modes. These two modes are Classic & Hide and Seek. For players looking for complex and immersive gameplay, Goose Goose Duck is clearly a winner.
 
### Character Player Customization
 
If character customization matters a lot to you, Goose Goose Duck has a plethora of options to choose from. This ranges from picking a color scale for Geese to picking up the right outfit, accessories, and headpieces for them. You can even customize the emotes of your farts in the game.
 
On the contrary, the customization option in Among Us is pretty limited. You might have wanted more customization options in the game but there isn’t much as of now.
 

 
### Roles
 
As of now, there are seven modes in Among Us including the Crewmate and Imposter. Speaking of Goose Goose Duck, there are 17 roles for the Duck, 21 roles for the Goose, and 6 neutral roles. so, it is clear that the latter has more roles than Among Us. Furthermore, some roles can also win by getting voted out. So, once you get the hook of the game, you might hesitate to vote out right away.
 
### Easygoing Game Play
 
Considering the above factors, Among Us has simpler and more easygoing gameplay. Being a social deduction game, some players might wish for simplicity rather than more gameplay. On the other hand, Goose Goose Duck is far from having simplistic gameplay. With an extensive range of roles, customization options, and game modes, it might take a while to get a gist of this game.
 
In my opinion, Among Us has done a pretty great job at that. Over the years, Among Us has been quite an influential game. It has given us slang like Suss, Imposter, Fake, and more that have stuck with the Internet till now.
 
### Maps
 
In addition to having more maps than Among Us, Goose Goose Duck has complexity in every map. As with the maps of every game, it might take some time to fully know them. But once you get acclimatized, you are in for a real treat.
 
What I enjoyed is that every map of Goose Goose Duck offers a different setting in all. So, if you want a map with a dark setting, you can choose a map like Goosechapel. Depending on these maps, you also get similar tasks according to their world setting.
 
### Is Goose Goose Duck Better?
 
The answer to that question is Yes. Goose Goose Duck offers more game modes, features, and customization options for players to pick from. In comparison to Among Us, it is arguably much less popular and mainstream. But it might be the best iteration of the mafia video game till now. Nevertheless, Goose Goose Duck is a better game than Among Us considering most of the factors mentioned above.
 
Lastly, it is for you to decide which is better for you to play with friends. So, we leave the verdict and the rest of the decision to you.
