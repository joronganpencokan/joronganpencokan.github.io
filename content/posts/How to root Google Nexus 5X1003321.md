Intro:

Are you tired of using your Google Nexus 5X like a regular smartphone? Do you want to unlock its hidden potential? Well, rooting your Nexus 5X is the solution for you! In just a few minutes, you can give your phone a new lease of life by unlocking its full potential. Rooting your Nexus 5X opens up a world of possibilities including the ability to install custom ROMs, delete bloatware, and increase your phone's performance. 

Benefits of Rooting:

Rooting is the process of gaining superuser access to your phone's operating system. This essentially means that you can have full control of your phone. The benefits of rooting your Nexus 5X are endless. You can install custom ROMs like LineageOS, Paranoid Android, or Resurrection Remix, which can enhance your phone's performance and battery life. You can also delete bloatware that comes pre-installed on your phone, freeing up valuable storage space. Furthermore, rooting your phone allows you to use powerful applications such as Tasker, which can automate your phone, saving you time and making your life easier. 

How to Root:

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of rooting, you need to understand that rooting your phone voids its warranty. This means that if anything goes wrong, you won't be able to take it back to the manufacturer. So, you need to proceed with caution. 

Firstly, you need to download the necessary files on your computer. You will need a custom recovery such as TWRP and the SuperSU zip file. Once you have downloaded these files, you need to transfer them to your phone's internal storage. 

Next, you need to enable USB debugging on your phone. This can be done by going to the Settings app, tapping on About phone, and tapping on Build number seven times. This will enable Developer Options. Go back to the main Settings screen and tap on Developer Options. From here, enable USB debugging. 

Now, connect your Nexus 5X to your computer. Open a terminal or command prompt window and type 'adb devices' to make sure your phone is connected. 

Next, reboot your phone into fastboot mode by turning it off and pressing and holding the power button and volume down button at the same time. When the Google logo appears, release the power button and keep holding the volume down button. This should boot you into the fastboot menu. 

Now, on your computer, open the command prompt or terminal window and type 'fastboot flash recovery twrp.img' (replace twrp.img with the name of the custom recovery you downloaded). This will flash the custom recovery to your phone. 

Once the custom recovery is flashed, boot your phone into recovery mode by holding the power button and volume down button at the same time. When TWRP loads, tap on Install and select the SuperSU zip file. Swipe to install and wait for the process to complete. 

Congratulations, you have successfully rooted your Nexus 5X! 

Conclusion:

Rooting your Google Nexus 5X is a simple process that can unlock its hidden potential. With just a few minutes of your time, you can have full control of your phone, delete bloatware, and increase its performance. Just make sure you proceed with caution and back up your data before rooting. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things with your newly rooted Nexus 5X!

Just like the Nexus 6P and any other Nexus device, gaining root access on the LG-made Nexus 5X is a relatively easy process. Especially if you have boot loader unlocked, the process hardly takes a few minutes. 
But if you don’t have the boot loader unlocked, gaining root access on the Nexus 5X can be quite troublesome since the internal storage of the handset will be wiped out. On the flip side, with root access on your 5X, you will be able to use apps like Root Explorer, Greenify and even install Xposed framework and its modules.
If you have made up your mind on rooting your Nexus 5X, simply follow the steps below.
Step 1: If you have not already, you need to first unlock the bootloader of your Nexus 5X. This can be done by following the steps here. Do not close the command prompt or the terminal window that you open during this process since it will be required in the later steps.
Step 2: Download TWRP recovery image file and SuperSU zip file for the Nexus 5X from below. Make sure to download the absolutely latest version of both otherwise you will run into compatibility issues. Transfer the files to the same “nexus” folder that you had created while unlocking the bootloader of the device. Also, for simplicity’s sake, rename the TWRP image file name to “nexus.img”.

Step 3: If your Nexus 5X is in bootloader/fastboot mode, boot it back into Android. You can go through the initial set up and log in to your Google accounts if you wish to. Once that is done, connect the device to your PC and transfer the SuperSU zip file to its internal storage.
Step 4: Again switch off the handset and boot it into bootloader mode by pressing and holding the Volume down and Power key simultaneously. Once the 5X boots into bootloader mode, connect it to your PC.
Step 5: Verify that the handset is being detected on your PC by running the following command:
Windows:
Mac:
Step 6: Now flash the TWRP image by executing the below command:
Step 7: Boot your Nexus 5X into TWRP recovery using the following command:
Step 8: Once TWRP boots up on your Nexus 5X, tap on ‘Install’ and then navigate and select the SuperSU zip file. The installation procedure will take only around a few seconds.
If TWRP prompts you to grant it permission to modify some system settings so that the recovery is not replaced at the next boot, make sure to swipe on yes.
Step 9: Proceed to reboot your device back into recovery by selecting the ‘Reboot system’ option. When prompted by TWRP to install SuperSU, make sure select the ‘Do not Install’ option.
Once your device boots back into Android, you should have the SuperSU app in your app drawer. To confirm whether you have root access on your Nexus 6P or not, you can use applications like Root Checker from Google Play.
Do note that since you have installed a custom recovery on your Nexus 5X, you will not be receiving direct OTA updates from Google. Instead, you will have to manually sideload them.
