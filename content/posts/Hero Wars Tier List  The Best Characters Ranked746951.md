Unleash the Ultimate Powerhouse in Hero Wars with the Ultimate Tier List of the Best Characters Ranked!

Hero Wars is a popular mobile game developed by NEXTERS Global. The game is an RPG which allows players to collect and level up heroes to defeat enemies and conquer various challenges. Whether you are a seasoned player or just starting out, one thing is certain, having the right team of heroes can make all the difference in winning the game.

To help players build the ultimate team, we have compiled the ultimate tier list of the best heroes in Hero Wars. This list has been created based on the characters' overall abilities, synergy with other heroes, and their versatility in various game modes. 

S Tier - The Best of the Best

1. Martha 
2. Keira 
3. Satori 
4. Jorgen 
5. Krista & Lars 

Our top five heroes in the S tier are Martha, Keira, Satori, Jorgen, and Krista & Lars. 

Martha is considered the best healer and support character in Hero Wars. She has a healing ability that can revive a fallen hero and can protect the entire team from physical attacks. Keira, on the other hand, is a solid damage dealer with high physical attack and critical damage. She can also attack multiple targets at once, making her a valuable addition to any team. Satori is a mystical hero that deals magical damage and has the ability to silence enemy magic users. He is effective in both PvP and PvE modes. Jorgen is a powerful support hero with abilities that can, among others, interrupt enemy abilities, heal and debuff. Krista & Lars are twin heroes who can deflect attacks, heal, and even revive each other.

A Tier - Strong and Versatile

1. Galahad
2. Qing Mao
3. Dorian
4. Andvari
5. Rufus

The A tier heroes are Galahad, Qing Mao, Dorian, Andvari, and Rufus. 

Galahad is a well-rounded tank character capable of soaking up a lot of damage, with his abilities to self-heal and stun. Qing Mao is a versatile hero that can stun and silence the enemy while dealing a lot of damage at the same time. Dorian is a powerful healer & support hero who also deals ranged magical damage to the enemy, a great all-around hero. Andvari is a control hero that can stun the enemy and his passive ability provides unbeatable support for the team by increasing their physical defense. Rufus is a great damage dealer in the form of a monster, who deals heavy physical damage and has a self-healing ability. 

B Tier - Good in Certain Situations

1. Jet
2. Orion
3. Dante
4. Fox
5. Celeste

Our final tier includes Jet, Orion, Dante, Fox, and Celeste. These heroes are still great in certain situations, but they do not provide the same level of usefulness as the heroes in the higher tiers.

Jet is a physical damage dealer who is good in PvP modes, and he has a fairly high armor and magic resistance. Orion is a wizard who can inflict magic damage and debuff the enemy while he can also Heal his allies. Dante is a tank character whose abilities include stunning enemies, self-regeneration, and having a great single-target damage. Fox is another damage dealer who can cause massive magical damage and silence the enemy. Celeste is a healer and support character that provides great healing and buff to her teammates while dealing magical damage to the enemy on her own.

In conclusion, having these heroes on your team can make a huge difference in winning the game. However, it’s important to note that your strategy should always consider your enemies’ teams and the game modes you will face. So, choose your heroes wisely, and always aim for greater power and success in Hero Wars.
