You won't believe how to solve the Halo Infinite startup crash on PC!

Halo Infinite is one of the most highly anticipated games of the year, but for some PC gamers, the experience has been less than great. Many players have reported a startup crash issue that has been causing frustration and disappointment.

However, there is good news - this issue can be fixed! In this article, we'll show you how to solve the Halo Infinite startup crash on PC so that you can get back to playing and enjoying the game.

Step 1: Update Your Graphics Drivers

The first step in solving the Halo Infinite startup crash on PC is to ensure that your graphics card drivers are up to date. This is a common solution for startup crash issues on PC, so it's worth checking that you have the latest drivers for your graphics card.

To update your graphics drivers, you can either do it manually or use a driver updater tool. The easiest way to do this is to use a third-party driver updater tool like Driver Booster. This tool will scan your system and automatically update any outdated drivers, including your graphics card driver.

Step 2: Disable Your Antivirus and Firewall

Another common reason for the Halo Infinite startup crash on PC is antivirus and firewall software. These applications can often conflict with Halo Infinite, causing it to crash during startup.

To fix this issue, you can disable your antivirus and firewall temporarily. This will allow you to run the game without any interference from these applications. Once you've started the game, you can re-enable your antivirus and firewall software.

It's important to note that disabling your antivirus and firewall software can leave your PC vulnerable to malware and other security threats. So, make sure to re-enable your antivirus and firewall software once you've finished playing the game.

Step 3: Run the Game in Compatibility Mode

If your graphics drivers are up to date and you've disabled your antivirus and firewall software, but you're still experiencing the Halo Infinite startup crash on PC, try running the game in compatibility mode.

Compatibility mode is a feature in Windows that allows you to run older programs on newer operating systems. It can also help to resolve compatibility issues between software applications.

To run Halo Infinite in compatibility mode, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the Halo Infinite shortcut or the game's executable file and select Properties.

2. Click the Compatibility tab.

3. Check the box that says 'Run this program in compatibility mode for' and choose a previous version of Windows from the dropdown menu.

4. Click Apply and then OK.

Step 4: Verify the Game Files

If none of the above solutions work, the issue may be related to corrupted game files. To check for corrupted game files, you can verify the game files using the Steam client.

Here's how to verify the game files in Steam:

1. Launch the Steam client.

2. Go to your Library and right-click on the Halo Infinite game.

3. Select Properties from the menu.

4. Click on the Local Files tab.

5. Click on Verify Integrity of Game Files.

This process will take some time, but it will check all of the game files for any errors or corruption. If any issues are found, the Steam client will download and replace the corrupted files automatically.

Conclusion

The Halo Infinite startup crash on PC can be frustrating, but it's not an unsolvable problem. By following the steps outlined above, you can get the game running smoothly and enjoy all of the excitement that it has to offer.

Remember, always make sure to keep your graphics drivers up to date, and be careful when disabling your antivirus and firewall software. These steps will help to ensure that your gaming experience is as safe and enjoyable as possible.
