If at any point, you want to re-hide the files, simply follow the same steps above, per your operating system, and simply make the opposite selection to Hide Hidden Files, Folders, and Drives.

 
### What if I want to hide one of my own files?


>Hiding any file or folder is an even simpler process. Simply right-click the file or folder and select Properties. You can then toggle the Hidden attribute on or off. In Windows 8 and 10, you can even use the Hide Selected Items button on the ribbon to make the process even faster.

 
### What about protected operating system files?


Some of the files hidden by Windows have an extra layer of protection. These files will remain hidden even when you follow the steps above to show hidden files and folders. Before revealing these files, it’s important to note that making changes to them, or deleting them, could cause serious damage to your operating system.
If you’re confident that you know what you’re doing, and you need to view these highly protected files, there is a way to do so. Simply follow the same steps listed above except, instead of looking for the Show Hidden Files selection, you’ll need to locate the Hide Protected Operating System Files selection and toggle it off.
>When doing so, you’ll be prompted with a warning and you’ll be required to click Yes to continue. You can then click OK to save your settings. Of course, you can always follow the same steps to toggle this setting back on (and you should) once you no longer need access to these files.
