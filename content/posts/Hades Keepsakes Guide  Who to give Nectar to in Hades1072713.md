Nectar is one of the rarest currency in Hades that stays with you even in death. Yes, you read that right! Nector can be gifted to any character you want in Hades but selecting the perfect recipient is a daunting task.
 
Unlike coins and Boons, Nectar is placed in Zagreus’ inventory. Whoever you gift Nector to will give you a Keepsake in return, which is an essential item that you can take along with you on your escape attempts, granting you a passive bonus. For the unversed, Keepsake provides unique bonuses throughout a run.

It is to be noted that you don’t get a Keepsake every time you give Nector to any character.  However, there are some characters which will surely provide Keeepsake upon receiving their first Nectar.
 
## Who to Give Nectar to in Hades
 
Some of the best choices to give Nectar to in Hades are Cerberus, Skelly, and Nyx. Upon receiving their first Nectar, they will provide Keepsake, that will help you get much further on your runs than earlier. The Keepsake you will receive from Cerberus is called the Old Spiked Collar and it will grant you +25 to your starting health.
 
The Keepsake you will get from Skelly is called the Lucky Tooth, allowing you to defy death and revive with 50 health, upon dying once per run. The Nyx’s Keepsake is called the Black Shawl and it will help you to enhance the damage you inflict to undamaged enemies and the damage you cause from the behind.
 
The only condition you will receive Keepsake from characters is when you fill-up the heart with a bow on it, which is usually the first heart for most of the characters.
