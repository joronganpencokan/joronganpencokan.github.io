Security is a vital concern if you store any sensitive data on your Mac or in your iCloud storage. There are a lot of in-depth Mac security measures that you can take, but the first, and most important, is to set an account password and lock your Mac when you aren't using it. This simple measure ensures that nobody will be able to access your local or iCloud data by simply using your Mac when you aren't looking.

The downside is you have to memorize a key combination.Apple menu: This is a good fallback method, as you don't need to memorize a key combination. The option to lock your screen is always located conveniently in the Apple menu.Hot corners: This method allows you to set it so that your screen locks when you move your mouse cursor into one of the four corners of your screen. If you're already using all four hot corners for other things, then you won't be able to use this method.

 
##   Check Your Password and Login Settings First
