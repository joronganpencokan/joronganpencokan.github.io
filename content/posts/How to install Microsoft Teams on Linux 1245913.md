If you’re required to use a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, Debian, or Red Hat), you no longer need to use Windows 11 (or Windows 10) to connect with colleagues at work since Microsoft Teams is also available on Linux.
 
However, Microsoft has dropped the Teams apps for Linux in favor of the Progressive Web App (WPA) version of the service, which can also install on your computer for a more traditional experience. 
 
Once you download and install the Microsoft Teams app, you can access all the same features available with the app on Windows, including chat, video meetings, calling, and collaboration on Office documents from your Microsoft 365 and business subscriptions within a single interface.
 
In the past, Microsoft provided a public download for Teams apps from the Microsoft Teams official page, but that’s no longer the case. However, you can still download a standalone application from the operating system’s app store, such as Ubuntu Software, or commands through the Snap store, or you can use the Progressive Web App (WPA) version of the service, which can also install on your computer for a more traditional experience.
