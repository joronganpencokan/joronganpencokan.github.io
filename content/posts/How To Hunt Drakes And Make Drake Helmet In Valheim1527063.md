If you are a fan of crafting games, then Valheim is the perfect game for you. One of the most crucial crafting items in Valheim is armor. Without armor, you will not be able to withstand the attacks of the powerful creatures that roam freely in the game world. 

One of the most impressive armor sets in Valheim is the Drake armor. The Drake armor comes in 3 pieces - the Drake Helmet, Drake Mail, and Drake Gauntlets.

It also looks intimidating, making your character look like a true Valheim warrior. In this article, we will show you how to unleash the hunter in you and craft the ultimate Drake Helmet in Valheim.
