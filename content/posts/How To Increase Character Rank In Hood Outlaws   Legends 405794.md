# Unlock the Secrets to Raising Your Hood Outlaws & Legends Status: Boost Your Character Rank Now!

If you're a fan of the game Hood Outlaws & Legends, you know that it's not just about playing the game but also about improving your character rank. The higher your rank, the better your stats, and the more effective you are in battle. But how do you go about increasing your character rank?

## Choose Your Character

The first step to increasing your character rank is choosing the right character for you. Each character in Hood Outlaws & Legends has its own strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right one for your play style can make all the difference. For example, if you prefer a more stealthy approach, you might want to choose the ranger, who can move quickly and quietly through the environment. If you prefer a more aggressive approach, you might want to choose the brute, who can use his strength to take out enemies quickly.

## Complete Contracts

The next step to increasing your character rank is to complete contracts. Contracts are missions that you can take on from your hideout. Completing contracts will not only give you valuable experience points but also other rewards such as gold and gear. Some contracts will also increase your notoriety, which is a measure of your character's reputation in the game. The higher your notoriety, the more contracts and rewards will become available.

## Improve Your Gear

Another way to boost your character rank is by improving your gear. Gear can be obtained by completing contracts, looting chests, or purchasing it with gold. Upgrading your gear will not only make it more effective but also increase your character's stats, such as health, armor, and damage. Always keep an eye out for new gear and don't be afraid to spend your gold on upgrading it.

## Master Your Skills

Finally, to really boost your character rank, you need to master your character's skills. Each character in Hood Outlaws & Legends has a unique set of skills that can be upgraded by spending skill points. These skills can range from improved health to more effective weapons. Make sure to spend your skill points wisely, and focus on the skills that best match your play style.

In conclusion, increasing your character rank in Hood Outlaws & Legends is all about choosing the right character, completing contracts, improving your gear, and mastering your skills. By following these tips, you'll soon be on your way to becoming an unstoppable force in the game. So what are you waiting for? Get out there and start raising your character rank now!
