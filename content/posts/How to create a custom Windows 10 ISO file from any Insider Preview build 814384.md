Have you ever wanted to customize your own Windows 10 operating system? Do you wish you could include only the applications and features you use most? Are you tired of the bloatware that comes with pre-installed versions of Windows 10? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you're in luck because you can learn how to easily customize your own Windows 10 Iso file today. 

## What is an Iso File?

An Iso file (or ISO image) is a disk image of an optical disk (such as a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray). It is a popular format used to create backup copies of disks or to distribute large files over the internet. An Iso file can contain the entire contents of a disk, including the file system, operating system, and installed applications. In the case of Windows 10, the Iso file can be downloaded from Microsoft's website and used to install or upgrade the operating system on a computer.

## Why Customize Your Windows 10 Iso File?

There are several reasons why you might want to customize your Windows 10 Iso file. One reason is to remove bloatware (pre-installed applications that you don't use) that can take up valuable storage space and slow down your computer. Another reason is to include only the applications and features you use most, which can help improve your productivity and save time. Customizing your Windows 10 Iso file can also give you more control over the operating system, allowing you to tweak settings and preferences to suit your needs.

## How to Customize Your Windows 10 Iso File

Customizing your Windows 10 Iso file may seem like a daunting task, but it's actually quite easy with the right tools and resources. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

### Step 1: Download Windows 10 Iso File

The first step is to download the Windows 10 Iso file from the Microsoft website. This file contains the entire contents of the operating system and will be used as the base for your customized image.

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Machine

To customize your Windows 10 Iso file, you will need to create a virtual machine (VM) that mimics your target system. This VM will allow you to install and configure applications and system settings without affecting your actual computer. You can use a virtualization software like VirtualBox or VMware to create a VM.

### Step 3: Install and Customize Applications

Once you have created a virtual machine, you can install and customize the applications you want to include in your customized Iso file. Make sure to install only the applications you use most often, and remove any bloatware or unnecessary programs that are pre-installed on the base image. This will help you save valuable storage space and streamline your system.

### Step 4: Tweak System Settings

In addition to installing and customizing applications, you can also tweak system settings to suit your needs. You can change the theme, desktop background, and other visual settings, as well as adjust preferences for the Start menu, taskbar, and other system features. Tweak these settings to suit your preferences and save the changes.

### Step 5: Create a Customized Image

Once you have made all the necessary adjustments and customizations, you can create your customized Windows 10 Iso file. To do this, you will need to use a tool like the Windows Automated Installation Kit (WAIK) or the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool. These tools will help you create a new image that contains all the changes and customizations you have made.

## Conclusion

Customizing your own Windows 10 Iso file can be a powerful way to gain more control over your operating system and improve your productivity. By removing bloatware, installing only the applications you use most, and tweaking system settings to suit your needs, you can create a streamlined system that works perfectly for you. Use the steps outlined in this article to customize your own Windows 10 Iso file today and experience the power of a customized operating system.

Recently Microsoft released the Windows 10 Insider Preview build, but the big surprise to many users is that they also learned that Microsoft won’t making available an ISO version of the operating system via the Windows Insider Program.
 
This should not be a problem as you can easily go to PC settings, Preview builds, and install the latest build from Microsoft’s servers. But the issue is that many users are testing Windows 10 Insider Preview on dual-boot system using a virtual hard drive (VHD/VHDX) and as it turns out this configuration isn’t supported to install new builds as users are getting the message “can’t install to a virtual hard drive” with the error message 0x80246007.
 
However, there is a workaround, you can create your own Windows 10 Insider Preview ISO image file or you can even convert the install.ESD to an install.wim to create a new VHD/VHDX and dual-boot your system with the latest version of Windows 10.
 
For those unfamiliar with the files: the install.ESD is basically is a file that contains all the Windows installation files, but it’s protected with encryption, and you can’t do much with it. The install.WIM is the same file as the .ESD, but it’s not protected, meaning that you can extract all the files without much difficulty with the right tool.
 
## Things you’ll need…
 
- A copy of the install.ESD file of the corresponding version of Windows 10. There is a numbers of ways in which you could do this. If you’re a good online scout, you’ll can figure this one out. Then you can also opt to create a virtual machine with the latest Insider Preview. Then you can browse C:\RecoveryImage where you can find the install.ESD. Or alternatively, you can start the installation on system that you can’t upgrade, and as soon the bits are downloaded and you click Install Now, quickly, go to C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources and copy the install.ESD to a new location.
 - ESD Decrypter tool, you can download it here.

 
## How to create a Windows 10 ISO file from any Insider build
 
- Unpack the ESD Decrypter (You can use 7zip to do this).
 - Copy the ESD Decrypter content files to the folder where you copied the install.ESD file.
 - Right-click the decrypt.cmd file and run it as administrator.
 - A blue screen Command Prompt will appear with a few options. Here you can choose to decrypt and convert an install.ESD to an install.wim, or you can create a full ISO file of Windows 10 Insider Preview. You should try creating an ISO version of Windows 10 as it’s more flexible to install the operating system on any machine (option number 4).

 
Once you have a custom Windows 10 Insider Preview ISO file, everything else is a piece of cake. You can install the operating system in a virtual machine — here are all the instructions. You can dual-boot your current installation using a VHD and the latest preview. 
 
Unpack the ESD Decrypter (You can use 7zip to do this).
 
Copy the ESD Decrypter content files to the folder where you copied the install.ESD file.
 
Right-click the decrypt.cmd file and run it as administrator.
 
A blue screen Command Prompt will appear with a few options. Here you can choose to decrypt and convert an install.ESD to an install.wim, or you can create a full ISO file of Windows 10 Insider Preview. You should try creating an ISO version of Windows 10 as it’s more flexible to install the operating system on any machine (option number 4).
 
To create a bootable USB drive with any version of Windows 10 Insider Preview, you can use this previous guide.
 
Although, you can now install any version of Windows 10 on any computer. If you’re using a virtual hard drive, you may have to start from scratch — but at least now it’s possible.
