Although Android has worked to provide the multiple apps working mode action through the split screen, several features are missing that stop the users from utilizing this feature.
One of the issues is that this function is still not compatible with all Android apps, and the users can only enjoy using it with the selected apps. Another is that the users could run only a single copy of the device simultaneously in the Split screen mode. The apps’ multiple usages are blocked and not eligible for the split screen mode.
