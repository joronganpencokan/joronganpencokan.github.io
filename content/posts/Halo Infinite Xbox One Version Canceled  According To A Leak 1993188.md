Shocking News: Xbox One Gamers Left in the Cold as Halo Infinite Gets the Axe According to Leaked Info!

As one of the most anticipated games of 2021, Halo Infinite was supposed to be a major selling point for the Xbox One console. Unfortunately, a recent leak suggests that the game may not be coming to the current generation of Microsoft's gaming system at all.

While Microsoft remains tight-lipped about the situation, rumors have been circulating about the development of the game for a while. Some reports suggest that the studio responsible for the game, 343 Industries, has been struggling to meet deadlines and satisfy Microsoft's requirements.

According to a leaked article from a major gaming news site, the game has hit another snag. It appears that due to technical limitations, Halo Infinite may not be able to run on the Xbox One. This means that the game may be delayed or even canceled for the console altogether.

This news is a major blow to Xbox One gamers who have been eagerly looking forward to the latest instalment of the iconic Halo franchise. With no new major titles in the pipeline for the console, the cancellation of Halo Infinite could signal the death knell for the system.

Microsoft has yet to confirm or deny the reports, but fans are already expressing disappointment and frustration on social media platforms. The Xbox One has struggled to compete with rival console brands in recent years and the failure of Halo Infinite to launch on the system will be a major setback.

Despite the current climate of uncertainty, there is a glimmer of hope for fans of the franchise. The leak also suggests that Microsoft plans to release the game on the next-generation Xbox Series X console, which is set to launch later this year.

While this may be good news for fans who are planning to upgrade to the new console, it leaves Xbox One gamers feeling left in the cold. With no new major titles to look forward to, many may decide to abandon the system altogether in favor of other gaming platforms.

In conclusion, the news surrounding the cancellation of Halo Infinite for the Xbox One is a significant blow to Microsoft and the console's loyal fan base. The decision appears to have been made due to technical limitations, but the long-term impact on the system remains to be seen. Only time will tell whether this setback will cause irreversible damage to the Xbox One brand.

In the past few hours, a very interesting rumor has jumped out of the web: the Xbox One version of Halo Infinite could be canceled from here soon. The verified user of ResetEra “Sponger” who previously leaked precise details about Xbox first-party games, has reported this sad news.
 
According to the player in question, developer 343 Industries is struggling too hard to get above 900p performance on Xbox One S, which would have led it to consider making the shooter a next-gen only title after its recent delay until 2021. “Current version of Halo Infinite on Xbox One S is nowhere near 1080p (even lower than 900p) and is having serious asset loading issues (much worse that you have seen on PC demo),” Sponger wrote on ResetEra.
 
If that were true, ditching the Xbox One version of Halo Infinite would represent a break from Xbox’s heavily promoted cross-gen release strategy. Microsoft had previously stated that all Xbox first-party titles for the next two years would be released on both Xbox One and Xbox Series X.
 
In a statement posted on its website, developer 343 Industries said the decision to delay the game was motivated by “multiple factors,” including COVID-19’s continuing impact on development.
 
Following the reveal of last month’s gameplay, the visual fidelity of Halo Infinite has faced multiple widespread criticisms from the media, fans, and even big brands, all of which highlighted issues with both the game’s art direction and the perceived lack of progress from the latest Halo game.
 
343 Industries had already admitted criticism of the game’s graphics and told fans it was taking the feedback “very seriously”. As per tradition, we would like to invite all our readers to take the information strictly with a grain of salt, since nothing has been confirmed by those in charge at the moment yet.
