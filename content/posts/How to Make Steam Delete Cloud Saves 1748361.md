# Say Goodbye to Lost Progress: Discover the Ultimate Guide on How to Make Steam Delete Cloud Saves!

If you're an avid gamer, you've probably heard of Steam. It's one of the most popular gaming platforms out there, and for good reason. It has a vast library of games, frequent sales, and an active community. One of the most useful features of Steam is its cloud save feature, which allows you to save your game progress to the cloud so you can pick up where you left off on any device. However, what do you do when you want to delete a cloud save? In this guide, we'll show you how to delete those pesky cloud saves and start fresh.

## Step 1: Locate the Cloud Save

The first step is to locate the cloud save file you want to delete. Open Steam on your device and navigate to the game you want to delete the cloud save for. Right-click on the game and select "Properties." In the Properties window, click on the "Updates" tab, then select "Cloud" under the "Steam Cloud" section. This will open a window showing all the cloud saves for that game.

## Step 2: Delete the Cloud Save

To delete a cloud save, simply click on it to select it, then click the "Delete" button at the bottom of the window. You'll be asked to confirm that you want to delete the cloud save, so make sure you're deleting the correct one. Once you confirm, the cloud save will be permanently deleted.

## Step 3: Disable Cloud Saves for a Game

If you want to disable cloud saves entirely for a game, go back to the "Steam Cloud" section in the Properties window and uncheck the "Enable Steam Cloud synchronization for [Game Name]" option. This will prevent any future cloud saves for that game, but it will not delete any cloud saves that have already been created.

## Step 4: Delete All Cloud Saves

If you want to delete all cloud saves for all games, go to the Steam menu in the top left corner of the screen and select "Settings." In the Settings window, select the "Cloud" tab, then click on the "Delete all cloud saves" button. This will delete all cloud saves for all games associated with your account.

## Conclusion

While cloud saves can be a lifesaver when it comes to gaming, there are times when you want to start fresh without the burden of old saves. With these simple steps, you can easily delete individual cloud saves, disable cloud saves for specific games, or delete all cloud saves at once. So, say goodbye to lost progress and hello to a fresh start on your favorite games.
