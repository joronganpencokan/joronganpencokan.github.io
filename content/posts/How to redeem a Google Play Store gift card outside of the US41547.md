If you are a big fan of Android apps, games or any other digital content, you would know how amazing Google Play Store is! With millions of apps and games available at your fingertips, it has become a one-stop-shop for digital entertainment, catering to the needs of users worldwide.

Google Play Store gift cards are a great way to enjoy these digital offerings without the need for a credit card. However, there is one major drawback - these gift cards are not supported in many countries outside the US.

Well, we have some good news for you! With our simple guide, you can now unlock the secret to redeeming Google Play Store gift cards globally, without the need for a US-based account.

Here's how it works:

Step 1: Get a Google Play Store Gift Card

This is the first step to redeeming Google Play Store gift cards anywhere in the world. You can get these gift cards from online retailers who offer international shipping. Alternatively, you can ask a friend or relative in the US to send you a Google Play Store gift card through email.

Step 2: Download a VPN

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is an app that lets you route your internet traffic through a server in a different location. By doing this, you can easily bypass location restrictions and access content that is normally restricted to a particular region.

There are many free and paid VPNs available in the market. We recommend using ExpressVPN, as it is a reliable and affordable option that works seamlessly across all platforms.

Step 3: Connect to a US Server

Once you have downloaded the VPN, open it and connect to any US-based server. This will make it appear that you are browsing the internet from the United States, even if you are physically located in a different part of the world.

Step 4: Redeem the Gift Card

With the VPN connection established, open the Google Play Store app and redeem your gift card. You should be able to see the gift card balance added to your account without any issues.

Step 5: Disconnect the VPN

Once the gift card has been redeemed, you can disconnect the VPN and use the Google Play Store app as usual. You will still be able to access all the content that was previously unavailable in your country.

In conclusion, with a little bit of effort, you can now easily redeem Google Play Store gift cards anywhere in the world, without the need for a US-based account. So, go ahead and explore the millions of apps and games available on the Google Play Store, and make the most of your gift card!

It has been quite a while since Google introduced the gift card feature in United States and and much more recently, United Kingdom. The company has not introduced the feature to any other region of the world, and does not allow users to redeem gift cards from unsupported geographical regions as well, which is quite frustrating. 
Thankfully, it is quite easy to redeem gift cards if you are living outside the US or U.K. Right now, the solution floating around the Internet is to actually create a new Gmail account using a U.S VPN and then redeem the gift card to that account. However, you can easily redeem a gift card from your existing Google account by following a few steps mentioned below.
Step 1: Head over to Tunnel Bear’s website to download and install their desktop client for your PC. Sign up/sign in, select the US Proxy and toggle the switch to On position.
Step 2: Open a new Incognito window on your browser and head over to wallet.google.com, and click on the Gear icon on the top right of the page.

Step 3: Google will be displaying your Home address and Country. Edit it, and select United States as your home country. You will need to enter a fake US address along with a phone number for this step. Google around if you cannot come up with a fake address and phone number. Make sure to click on the Save button once you have entered all the details.
Step 4: Similarly, under Payment methods, add a new credit card and use a fake US billing address. After saving the details, make sure to set it as the default card.

Step 5: Now, proceed to play.google.com and select the ‘Redeem’ option on the left side. Enter the Play Store redeem coupon and you’re done!
Keep in mind that you cannot change your primary address until you spend the Play Store credit balance is nil. If you hit a road block, drop in a comment and we will be happy to help you!
