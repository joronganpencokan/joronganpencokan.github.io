Unlock Unlimited Firepower: The Ultimate Guide to Boosting Your Drone's Ammo Capacity in The Surge 2!

Are you tired of running out of ammunition while taking on tough enemies in The Surge 2? Do you want to have unlimited firepower at your disposal? Look no further because we have the ultimate guide to boosting your drone's ammo capacity!

Step 1: Upgrade Your Drone Modules
The first step to increasing your drone's ammo capacity is to upgrade its modules. Every new module you install will increase the drone's ammo capacity by a certain amount. Some modules will also increase the speed at which your drone reloads, allowing you to fire more shots in a shorter amount of time.

Step 2: Invest in Ammo Upgrades
The next step is to invest in ammo upgrades. These upgrades will increase the amount of ammunition you can carry for each weapon type. You should focus on upgrading the ammo capacity for your most used weapons first. This will ensure that you always have enough ammunition for those tough battles.

Step 3: Find Ammo Boxes
As you explore the world of The Surge 2, keep an eye out for ammo boxes. These boxes contain additional ammunition that you can use to replenish your drone's ammo supply. You can usually find these boxes near enemy drop zones or scattered throughout the game world.

Step 4: Swap Out Weapons
If you find that you are running out of ammunition too quickly, it may be time to switch to different weapons. Look for weapons that have a high damage output but also have a lower ammunition cost. This will allow you to take down enemies quickly while conserving your ammo for later battles.

Step 5: Use Your Drone Wisely
Finally, make sure that you are using your drone wisely. Don't waste your ammunition on weak enemies or when your drone is not needed. Instead, focus on using your drone to take down tougher enemies, or to support you in battles where you are outnumbered.

With these tips and tricks, you'll be able to unlock unlimited firepower and take on even the toughest enemies in The Surge 2. So upgrade your drone modules, invest in ammo upgrades, find ammo boxes, swap out weapons, and use your drone wisely to become a true powerhouse in the world of The Surge 2!
