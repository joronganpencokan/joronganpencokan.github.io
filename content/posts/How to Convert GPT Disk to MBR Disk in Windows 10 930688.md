You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Convert GPT Disk To MBR Disk In Windows 10 - Unlock The Secret Now!

Are you looking to convert your GPT (GUID Partition Table) disk to an MBR (Master Boot Record) disk in Windows 10? If yes, then you have come to the right place.

In this article, we will guide you through the easy steps to convert your GPT disk to MBR disk in Windows 10. But, before we dive into the steps, let's understand what GPT and MBR disks are.

GPT disks are a modern partitioning scheme that is used to support larger disks and allow for booting using the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface). On the other hand, MBR disks are the traditional partitioning scheme that is used to support disks smaller than 2 TB in size and boot using BIOS (Basic Input Output System).

Now, let's jump into the easy steps to convert your GPT disk to MBR disk in Windows 10.

Step 1: Open Disk Management

To open Disk Management, right-click on the Windows Start button and click on Disk Management. Alternatively, you can press the Windows Key + X and select Disk Management from the menu.

Step 2: Backup your data

Before you proceed with the conversion process, it's important to backup all your data. This is because the conversion process will erase all the data on your disk.

Step 3: Delete all partitions on the disk

Once you have backed up all your data, delete all the partitions on the disk by right-clicking on each partition and selecting Delete Volume.

Step 4: Convert the disk to MBR

Now, right-click on the disk and select Convert to MBR Disk.

Step 5: Create new partitions

After the conversion process is complete, you can create new partitions on the disk by right-clicking on the disk and selecting New Simple Volume.

And that's it! You have successfully converted your GPT disk to MBR disk in Windows 10. It's that easy.

In conclusion, if you are looking to convert your GPT disk to MBR disk in Windows 10, then follow the easy steps mentioned above. Just remember to backup all your data before you proceed with the conversion process.

MBR stands for Master Boot Record which uses the standard BIOS partition table. In contrast, GPT stands for the GUID Partition Table which was introduced as a part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). Although GPT is considered better than MBR due to the limitations of MBR which is it can’t support disk size larger than 2 TB, you cannot create more than 4 partitions on an MBR Disk, etc.
 

 
Now older operating systems still support MBR partition style and chances are if you are using an old system then your system already has an MBR Disk partition. Also, if you want to use 32-bit Windows, then it won’t work with the GPT Disk, and in that case, you need to convert your disk from GPT to MBR. Anyway, without wasting any time, let’s see How to Convert GPT Disk to MBR Disk in Windows 10 with the help of the below-listed tutorial.

### Method 1: Convert GPT Disk to MBR Disk in Diskpart [Data Loss]
 
1. Open Command Prompt. The user can perform this step by searching for ‘cmd’ and then press Enter.
 
2. Type Diskpart and hit Enter to open Diskpart utility.
 
3. Now type the following command one by one and hit Enter after each one:
 
list disk (Note down the number of the disk which you want to convert from GPT to MBR)
select disk # (Replace the # with the number which you noted down above)
clean (Running the clean command will delete all partitions or volumes on the disk)
convert mbr
 
4. The “convert mbr” command will convert an empty basic disk with the GUID Partition Table (GPT) partition style into a basic disk with the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition style.
 
5. Now you need to create a New Simple Volume on the unallocated MBR disk.
 
This is How to Convert GPT Disk to MBR Disk in Windows 10 without the help of any third-party tools.
 
### Method 2: Convert GPT Disk to MBR Disk in Disk Management [Data Loss]
 
1. Press Windows Key + R then type diskmgmt.msc and hit Enter to open Disk Management.
 
2. Under Disk Management, select the Disk you want to convert then make sure right-click on each of its partitions and select Delete Partition or Delete Volume. Do this until only unallocated space is left on the desired disk.
 
Note: You will only convert a GPT disk to MBR if the disk does not contain any partitions or volumes.
 
3. Next, right-click on the unallocated space and select “Convert to MBR Disk” option.
 
4. Once the disk is converted to MBR, and you can create a New Simple Volume.
 
### Method 3: Convert GPT Disk to MBR Disk Using MiniTool Partition Wizard [Without Data Loss]
 
MiniTool Partition Wizard is a paid tool, but you can use the MiniTool Partition Wizard Free Edition to convert your disk from GPT to MBR.
 
1. Download and install MiniTool Partition Wizard Free Edition from this link.
 
2. Next, double-click on the MiniTool Partition Wizard application to launch it then click on Launch Application.
 
3. From the left-hand side, click on “Convert GPT Disk to MBR Disk” under Convert Disk.
 
4. In the right window, select the disk # (# being the disk number) which you want to convert then click on the Apply button from the menu.
 
5. Click Yes to confirm, and the MiniTool Partition Wizard will start converting your GPT Disk to MBR Disk.
 
6. Once finished, it will show the successful message, click OK to close it.
 
7. You can now close MiniTool Partition Wizard and restart your PC.
 
This is How to Convert GPT Disk to MBR Disk in Windows 10 without data loss using MiniTool Partition Wizard.
 
### Method 4: Convert GPT Disk to MBR Disk Using EaseUS Partition Master [Without Data Loss]
 
1. Download and Install EaseUS Partition Master Free Trial from this link.
 
2. Double-click on the EaseUS Partition Master application to launch it and then from the left-hand side menu click on “Convert GPT to MBR” under Operations.
 
3. Select the disk # (# being the disk number) to convert then click on Apply button from the menu.
 
4. Click Yes to confirm, and the EaseUS Partition Master will start converting your GPT Disk to MBR Disk.
 
5. Once finished, it will show the successful message, click Ok to close it.
