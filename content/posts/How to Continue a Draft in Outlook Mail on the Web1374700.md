Are you tired of losing important emails when writing drafts on Outlook Mail on the Web? Do you ever worry that your work will disappear into the void without any chance of retrieval? Fear not - we have discovered the ultimate secret to never losing your drafts again!

First, let's understand the problem. When writing an email draft on Outlook Mail on the Web, if you accidentally close the tab or your computer shuts down unexpectedly, your draft can be lost forever. This can be frustrating and time-consuming, especially if you had spent a significant amount of time working on the email.

To avoid losing your drafts, use the following tips:

1. Save your draft regularly
It may seem like a no-brainer, but it's essential to save your draft regularly to ensure you don't lose any work. Outlook Mail on the Web has an auto-save feature that saves a copy of your draft every few seconds. Still, it's always best to manually save your work by clicking the "Save" button every few minutes or after making significant changes.

2. Keep multiple tabs open
An easy way to prevent losing your drafts is by keeping multiple tabs open. This way, if you accidentally close one tab, your work is still saved on another tab. To do this, click on the "+" sign next to your tab and open a new tab to continue writing your email draft.

3. Use the Drafts folder 
Outlook Mail on the Web has a dedicated Drafts folder that saves all your email drafts automatically. If you accidentally close the window or your computer shuts down, your draft will still be accessible in the Drafts folder. You can also save drafts to this folder manually by clicking on the "Save draft" button and selecting the Drafts folder.

4. Enable automatic saving
To save yourself the trouble of constantly clicking the "Save" button, consider enabling the automatic saving feature. Go to Settings, select "General," and toggle the "Automatically save items that have not been sent after this many minutes" feature. This way, your drafts will be automatically saved every few minutes.

In conclusion, anyone who uses Outlook Mail on the Web knows the frustration of losing an important email draft. By following the simple tips mentioned above, you can avoid this problem and never have to worry about losing your work again. Happy emailing!
