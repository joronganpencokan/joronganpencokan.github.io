# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Join Images Vertically or Horizontally on Your Mac!

Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you need to combine multiple images into one, either vertically or horizontally? It could be for a project, a social media post, or just to tidy up your cluttered image library. Whatever the reason, you don't have to spend hours on complicated software or hire a professional designer to do it for you. Your Mac comes with a built-in feature that allows you to merge two or more images with just a few clicks. In this article, we'll show you how.

## Step 1: Open the images you want to merge

The first step is to open all the images you want to merge. You can do this by double-clicking on each image or by selecting them all and opening them together. Once you have all the images open, it's time to move on to the next step.

## Step 2: Select the images you want to merge

With all the images open, you need to select the ones you want to combine. To do this, hold the "Command" key and click on each image you want to merge. You can select as many or as few images as you want.

## Step 3: Open the Preview app

With the images selected, right-click on any one of them, and from the context menu, click on "Open With" and select "Preview." The Preview app will open with all the selected images loaded.

## Step 4: Join the images

In Preview, click on "View" from the top menu bar, and from the dropdown menu, select "Thumbnails." This will show you all the selected images in thumbnail view.

To join the images horizontally, hold the "Shift" key and click on each image thumbnail from right to left in the order you want them to appear. With all the images selected, click on "Edit" from the top menu bar and select "Align." From the submenu, click on "Horizontal."

To join the images vertically, hold the "Shift" key and click on each image thumbnail from top to bottom in the order you want them to appear. With all the images selected, click on "Edit" from the top menu bar and select "Align." From the submenu, click on "Vertical."

## Step 5: Save the merged image

Once you have aligned the images, they will appear as one combined image in the Preview workspace. To save the merged image, click on "File" from the top menu bar, and select "Export." Choose your desired file format, name your file, and select your save location. Click on "Save," and you're done.

And there you have it, a simple, quick, and easy way to join images vertically or horizontally on your Mac. Whether you want to create a social media post, a project for work, or simply combine images to make your library less cluttered, this method is a great solution. Give it a try, and you'll be amazed at how easy and convenient it is.

Joining images might seem like a regular task for you if you happen to be a photographer or anyone who plays around with images on a computer. There are various tools available that let you edit images, retouch them, and even join them together however you want.
 
If what you want to do is simply join two images together, vertically or horizontally, you don’t need to use an expensive photo editing app for that. On a Mac you can use the built-in Preview app to join multiple images together as if these images were never apart. And the best thing is that this is a simple task.
 
## Joining Images Vertically or Horizontally
 
In the example below I am going to demonstrate how you can join two images horizontally using Preview in Mac. You can use the same method to join images vertically, but you need to specify the pixels of height and not the width in such case.
 
The two images that I am going to use are named as “IMAGE-1” and “IMAGE-2.”
 
1. Right-click on IMAGE-1, and select “Open With” followed by “Preview” to open the image in the Preview app.
 

 
2. When the image launches in Preview, click on “Edit” followed by “Select All” to select the image.
 
3. Click on “Edit” followed by “Copy” to copy the entire image. You will use this copied image in the rest of the steps.
 
4. Click on “Tools” followed by “Adjust Size …” in the Preview to adjust the size of the image. It will help us create enough space for the other image that we are going to join with this one.
 
5. In the “Width” box, enter the sum of the width of the two images that you are going to join.
 
For example, I have two images and each of them is 300 pixels wide. So I will enter “600” in the “Width” box in order to create adequate space for the image that is going to be joined here.
 
If you are joining images vertically, you will need to do the same thing but for the “Height” box.
 
Uncheck the “Scale proportionally” option and click on “OK” to save the changes.
 
6. Click on “Edit” followed by “Paste” to paste the original IMAGE-1 that you copied earlier. Once it is pasted move it all the way to the left edges. The remaining area in the image will be filled up by the other image. Keep this Preview window open.
 
7. Right-click on IMAGE-2 and select “Open With” followed by “Preview” to launch the other image.
 
8. When the image launches, click on “Edit” followed by “Select All” to select the entire image.
 
9. Copy the entire image by clicking on “Edit” followed by “Copy” in Preview.
 
10. Get to the IMAGE-1 window in Preview and click on “Edit” followed by “Paste” to paste IMAGE-2 into the IMAGE-1 window.
 
When the image is pasted, move it all the way to the right.
 
11. You should see the resulting joined image on your screen.
 
12. You can now save this as a new image.
 
## Conclusion
 
Sometimes, the built-in apps let you get many tasks done that you thought could only be done on high-end apps. The above task is a great example of this.
