# Unleash Your Snapchat Superpowers: The Ultimate Guide to Skyrocketing Your Snap Score!

Snapchat has become a household name in the social media scene, especially among young people. With features such as filters, lenses, and personalized Bitmojis, Snapchat has become more than just a messaging app. It has allowed users to express themselves creatively and share their lives with their friends and family. But did you know that there's another aspect to Snapchat that can boost your social status? We're talking about your Snap Score.

Your Snap Score represents the number of snaps you have sent and received on Snapchat. The higher your score, the more active you are on the app. While some may see this as a superficial aspect of social media, having a high Snap Score could potentially increase your social status and help you gain more followers. In this article, we'll dive into some tips and tricks to skyrocket your Snap Score!

## 1. Snap, Snap, Snap Away

The most obvious way to increase your Snap Score is to send and receive more snaps. However, this doesn't necessarily mean spamming your friends with irrelevant snaps. Instead, try to capture interesting moments in your day, share your hobbies, or showcase your creativity through filters and lenses. Try to aim for at least 30 or more snaps per day.

## 2. Snap Streaks

Snap Streaks are Snapchat's way of gamifying messaging. When you and a friend consistently send snaps to each other within 24 hours, you start a Snap Streak. The longer the streak continues, the higher the number appears next to the fire emoji. Snap Streaks are a great way to incentivize frequent snaps and increase your Snap Score. Just remember to keep up the consistency, or else the streak will end.

## 3. Add More Friends

The more friends you have on Snapchat, the more opportunities you have to send and receive snaps. If you're looking to increase your Snap Score quickly, try adding more friends from your contacts or through mutual friends. You can also join Snapchat groups or communities to meet new people.

## 4. Use Multiple Devices

Did you know that you can increase your Snap Score by logging into multiple devices? Logging into Snapchat on different devices and sending snaps from each one can increase your score much faster. However, make sure to follow Snapchat's rules and avoid using third-party apps to increase your score. Otherwise, you risk getting banned from the app.

## 5. Save Your Snaps

Saving your snaps to your device can also increase your Snap Score. Every time you save a snap, it counts as a new snap for your score. So, if you're looking to boost your score, take advantage of the save feature and save your favorite snaps.

## 6. Share Your Snapcode

Your Snapcode is a unique QR code that allows others to add you on Snapchat easily. Sharing your Snapcode on other social media platforms or in person can attract more followers and increase your opportunities to send and receive snaps.

In conclusion, boosting your Snap Score can be a fun and rewarding experience on Snapchat. It may seem like a superficial aspect of social media, but having a high score can potentially increase your social status and help you gain more followers. By following these tips and tricks, you'll be well on your way to becoming a Snapchat superuser!

- Snap your friends often. This is, by far, the most important thing you can do to increase your Score.Send Snaps to multiple people at once. This method is an effective way of getting more Score out of a single Snap, because each person you send a Snap to earns you a point. Of course, don't spam your friends.Open all of your Snaps. Leaving Snaps unread means leaving Snapchat Score on the table. However, sending messages over Snapchat won't increase your score.Add friends.
