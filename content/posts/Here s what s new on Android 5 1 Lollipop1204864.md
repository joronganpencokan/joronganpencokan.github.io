# Revolutionary Features in Android 5.1 Lollipop You Can't Afford to Miss!

If you're a tech enthusiast, you're probably always on the lookout for the latest updates and developments in the tech world. And if you're an Android user, you're in luck – Android 5.1 Lollipop is here, and it's packed with revolutionary features you won't want to miss.

So what's new in Android 5.1 Lollipop? Let's dive in.

## Improved Performance

One of the most significant updates in Android 5.1 Lollipop is the improvement in performance. This new version of Android is designed to run faster and more smoothly than its predecessors. It includes a new runtime called ART (Android Run Time) that improves app performance by up to 100%.

This means that your apps will now launch faster and run smoother than ever before. You'll also experience a smoother transition between apps, so you can switch between them quickly and without any lag.

## Do Not Disturb Mode

If you're tired of constantly being interrupted by notifications and alerts, Android 5.1 Lollipop has got you covered. This new version of Android includes a "Do Not Disturb" mode that allows you to silence all notifications except for calls and texts from your favorite contacts.

This feature is perfect for when you need to focus on a task or want to have some uninterrupted relaxation time without worrying about constant interruptions.

## Device Protection

Android 5.1 Lollipop also includes a new security feature called "Device Protection." With this feature enabled, your device is protected even if it falls into the wrong hands.

When enabled, Device Protection requires users to enter their Google account credentials to access the device after a factory reset. This means that even if your device is stolen, the thief won't be able to unlock it without your Google account information.

## HD Voice and Wi-Fi Calling

Android 5.1 Lollipop also includes support for HD Voice and Wi-Fi Calling. This means that you can now make higher quality voice calls over your carrier's network and over Wi-Fi.

This feature is perfect for those who are in areas with poor cellular coverage or for those who want to save on their cellular data usage by making calls over Wi-Fi.

## Conclusion

Android 5.1 Lollipop is a game-changer when it comes to Android performance and features. With its improved performance, "Do Not Disturb" mode, Device Protection, HD Voice, and Wi-Fi Calling, this update is sure to please Android users everywhere.

If you haven't already updated to Android 5.1 Lollipop, what are you waiting for? These revolutionary features are too good to miss!

The Android 5.1 Lollipop has been a hot news topic since last month, when reports showed the appearance of the new minor version update in the Android One phones in Indonesia. Google however, took almost a month after the first appearance to make it official, which finally happened last week. Now, the changelog of the Android 5.1 Lollipop is also official, which can be listed as:
 

 
## HD voice calling
 
High Definition voice calling allows for crystal-clear audio quality on voice calls over supported networks. O2 is pretty much the only UK not to support this feature, so this feature should really benefit a lot of Android users in this country.
 
## Wi-Fi and Bluetooth shortcuts
 
Anyone who finds themselves flitting from Wi-Fi hotspot to Wi-Fi hotspot will know how irritating it can be plunging into the settings menu every time you need to make a new connection.
 
Android 5.1 solves that quibble in style, by providing specific connection access from the drop-down quick settings menu. This manifests itself as a little down arrow below each of the usual Wi-Fi and Bluetooth toggles.
 
It doesn’t sound like a big addition, but this is one of those little things that we’ve found ourselves tutting over for years.
 
## Device Protection
 
This security improvement ensures that your phone will remain locked even if a thief submits it to a factory reset. The only way anyone is getting access you your phone is if they know your Google account details.
 
So that should just be you, then.
 
## Dual-SIM support
 
Just as the name suggests, the ability to run two SIM cards simultaneously is now right there in Android 5.1.
 
This feature is popular in developing countries, where handsets are often shared and multiple accounts held, but it hasn’t really caught on here in the West yet. We can see how it could, though, with the potential for having a single handset containing both your work and personal SIM cards.
 
## Interruptions improvements
 
Android 5.0 has attracted criticism from some for leaving out a true silent mode setting. Well, there still isn’t a silent mode in Android 5.1, but the interruptions function has been improved.
 
You still get those None, Priority, or All options when tweaking the volume, but now you don’t have to disable your alarms when you simply want to silence that ringer.
 
There’s a new ‘Until next alarm’ option that sees to that.
 
## Heads-up notifications
 
Notifications were one of the strongest features of Android 5.0 Lollipop, but that doesn’t mean that they were perfect.
 
One notable improvement in Android 5.1 is to the heads-up notification system – those alerts that slide into view while you’re using the phone.
 
Previously, when you slid these alerts out of the way of what you were doing (watching a video, for example), Android 5.0 would dismiss the notification altogether. Now it just removes that notification from your immediate view, and you can pick it up manually at a later date by dragging down the notification menu.
 
## Fixes and improvements
 
There are around 1,400 tweaks and fixes going on under the hood of Android 5.1, most of which you won’t even notice. We don’t feel particularly inclined to list them, either, as the majority of them are pretty minor.
 
Undoubtedy the most notable of these fixes, however, is for the infamous memory leak issue, which brought many a Nexus phone (and the update schedules of many Android manufacturers) to its knees.
 
In many ways, these little technical fixes are the most important facet of Android 5.1, as they should result in the first properly stable version of Lollipop.
