# Windows 10 Users Beware: This Simple Trick Will Halt System Upgrades AND Save You From Headaches!

Windows 10 has been around for quite some time now and it is no secret that Microsoft has been aggressive in pushing system upgrades to its users. In fact, the company has gone as far as to make Windows 10 upgrade notifications appear as popups, asking users to upgrade their system immediately. While upgrading your system can be a good thing, there are times when it is not necessary or wanted. This is why we want to share a simple trick with Windows 10 users that will allow them to halt system upgrades and save themselves from headaches.

## The Risks of System Upgrades

Before we get to the trick, let's take a moment to talk about the risks of system upgrades. Whenever you upgrade your system, there is always a chance that things might go wrong. Whether it is due to compatibility issues, driver problems, or software conflicts, system upgrades can cause all sorts of issues. These problems can range from minor annoyances like slow performance and poor battery life to major headaches like system crashes and data loss.

## The Trick to Halt System Upgrades

Now that we have established the dangers of system upgrades, let's get to the trick that will help you halt them. First, you need to open the Run dialog box by pressing the Windows key + R. In the box that appears, type "gpedit.msc" and click OK. This will open the Local Group Policy Editor. From here, navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update. 

Once you are in the Windows Update folder, find the option that says "Configure Automatic Updates." Double-click on it to open the settings. Here, you will see four options that control the behavior of automatic updates. Choose the option that says "Enabled" and then set the drop-down menu to "2 – Notify for download and notify for install." This will allow you to control when system upgrades are installed on your computer. 

When you choose this setting, you will be notified when updates are available for download. From here, you can choose to download and install them right away or delay them until you are ready. This gives you complete control over the upgrade process and ensures that you are not surprised by an unexpected system upgrade.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, upgrading your system can be risky and sometimes unwanted. The trick we shared here will allow you to take control of the system upgrade process and stay in charge of when and how they are installed on your system. By setting your system to "Notify for download and notify for install," you can avoid unexpected upgrades and save yourself from potential headaches. So, if you are a Windows 10 user, be sure to apply this trick today!

In Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 Microsoft gave users the options of controlling when and if the users wanted to get an update. But this is something that has changed in Windows 10, at least in the Home Edition. It looks like Microsoft doesn’t want any more at-risk computers out there, but it should be up to the user whether they want their PC upgraded or not. Users should not be forced to get something they don’t want to try, and hopefully Microsoft will change that soon.
 
Microsoft said that users will have access to the latest updates in Windows Update and that only Windows 10 Pro, Education, and Enterprise will have the option of delaying these updates. Home Edition users will have no control over if and when they receive these upgrades. This is something that many users don’t like since Microsoft is taking away the control they once had, and some users don’t want these updates because it might come with features that are still buggy. The users doesn’t want to deal with that. Many will want to wait until those bugs are fixed so that they will not have to deal with the problems and headaches they usually bring, and some users are happy with what they currently have and want to keep things as is.
 
## Enable Metered Connection
 
Some users have even opted to enable the Metered Connection feature that can also be found in Windows 10 Home Edition. With this feature you can tell Microsoft that your Internet connection is limited in some way, and the tech giant will or should wait while you have this on. To turn this feature on go to “Start Menu -> Change WiFi Settings -> Advance Options -> Metered Connection.”
 

 
There is one downside to this, and it’s that the feature will only work if your W10 computer is on WiFi. Only Microsoft knows why they don’t let you indicate that you have a metered connection through Ethernet. Hopefully, Microsoft will change that in the near future.
 
When a user delays these updates, they are deferred for several months, but Microsoft does not specify the exact amount of months. Sooner or later these updates are going to be installed since you can’t delay them forever, but at least when you get them, they will not have as many problems as when they first came out. But what about security updates? Don’t worry, by delaying upgrades security updates are not affected, so you’re good. Microsoft made that perfectly clear.
 
## Deferring Upgrade
 
If you are one of the lucky Windows 10 users that can delay updates, then you need to go to “Update & Security -> Windows Update -> Advanced Options.” Right above “View your update history,” you will see “Defer upgrades.” Click on that to enable it.
 
## Conclusion
 
There is not doubt that Windows 10 is much better than Windows 8, but there are still some things it needs to change, such as being able to decide if Home Edition users want to receive upgrades at a certain time. Do you like getting updates when Microsoft releases them or would you rather wait? Let us know in the comments.
