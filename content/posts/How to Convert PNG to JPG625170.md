Transform Your Images with a Simple Trick: Learn How to Convert PNG to JPG!

Images are used everywhere; from personal projects to business promotions, images play a vital role in our lives. However, images come in different formats, with PNG and JPG being the most common. These two image file formats come with their unique features, but sometimes you may need to convert a PNG to JPG for image optimization. This task is straightforward and can be completed using different image-editing software. In this article, we'll show you how to convert PNG to JPG and the reasons why you might want to do so.

Why Convert PNG to JPG?

PNG is known for its lossless compression, which means it retains the quality of the image when compressed. This makes PNG ideal for images with fewer colors or those that need a transparent background. On the other hand, JPG, short for Joint Photographic Experts Group, uses lossy compression, which means it loses some quality when compressed. However, JPG files can be compressed to a smaller size, making them ideal for web viewing and sharing.

There are several reasons why you might want to convert PNG to JPG. Firstly, JPG files are smaller in size, making them easier to share online or via email without losing the quality of the image. Secondly, JPG files are perfect for images with lots of colors and gradients, which can look pixelated or jagged when converted to PNG. Finally, if an image requires a white or solid background, a JPG file can help save on bandwidth and loading time.

How to Convert PNG to JPG using Image Editing Software

Converting PNG to JPG is a straightforward process that can be completed using different image editing software such as Photoshop, GIMP, and Microsoft Paint. For this guide, we will use Microsoft Paint, which comes pre-installed on most Windows computers.

Step 1: Open the PNG file in Paint.

Step 2: Go to File > Save As.

Step 3: Select the file type as JPEG.

Step 4: Choose a location where to save the file and give it a name.

Step 5: Click Save, and you're done!

Other image editing software allows you to adjust image quality, resize images, and optimize for web viewing. You can also use online image converters such as Online-Convert, Convertio, and Zamzar, which offer similar file conversion services.

Conclusion

Converting PNG to JPG is a simple process that can help optimize your images for web sharing and viewing, making them easily accessible to your audience. With the right image editing software or online converter, you can achieve the desired file format for your images. We hope this guide has helped you learn how to convert PNG to JPG and the reasons behind the conversion.

If you have a PNG photo, you might find it's hard to post to social media, attach to email, or otherwise share. Still, there are several ways to convert PNG images to JPG format, whether you're a photo expert or have no idea what PNG stands for.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Windows: Open the image in Paint and select File > Save As. Choose JPEG from the drop-down menu and save the image.Mac: Open the image in Preview and select File > Export. Choose JPEG, adjust the quality if necessary, and select Save.Note: You can convert PNG to JPG on any platform using third-party editing software like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP.

 
##   Convert a Picture to JPG With Microsoft Paint  
 

If you don't have any fancy photo editing software and aren't interested in getting any, you can do this with Microsoft Paint or Paint 3D on Windows computers.

 

Open the image in Paint. Choose File or Menu > Save As. A File Explorer menu opens. Choose JPEG from the drop-down menu and save the image where you can easily find it.

 
##   Use Preview App to Convert PNG to JPEG on a Mac  
 

Converting PNG to JPEG on the Mac is super easy as every Mac comes with the program called Preview, which does a lot more than the name implies.

 
- Open the .png file you want to convert by double-clicking it. The image opens in Preview by default.
 - Click the File menu at the top of the Preview screen and select Export.
 - Choose JPEG in the Format drop-down menu.
 - Adjust the size with the Quality slider if desired and click Save.

 
##   Use Photos App to Convert PNG to JPEG on iOS  
 

The photos app on your iPad or iPhone can convert any image to a JPEG, but you must make a change to the file in order to trigger the conversion.

 

Open the .png file you want to convert by double-clicking it. The image opens in Preview by default.

 

Click the File menu at the top of the Preview screen and select Export.

 

Choose JPEG in the Format drop-down menu.

 

Adjust the size with the Quality slider if desired and click Save.

 

So, if you have the image, save it to your photo library like you would any image. Then, in the Photos app, edit the photo like you would any image (tapping the magic wand is a good way to do this quickly). Now when you share the image, it will be shared a JPEG.

 
##   How to Change PNG to JPG on Any Platform: Photo Editing Software  
 

If you're hoping to do more with professional or semi-professional editing software, it's a good idea to use it as often as possible, even for simple tasks, as it helps you get used to the environment. General Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) is a common application that can be used for many things in addition to converting PNG files to JPG.

 
You must make a change to the file in order for it to be automatically saved as a JPG.
 
- Open the image in GIMP.
 - Make any edits, such as resizing, filtering, or otherwise that you'd like to do,
 - Go to File > Export As or Save As.
 - In the window that opens, you can either change the file extension at the end to .jpg, or you can click the Save File As drop-down menu and choose JPG from the menu that appears.
 - Once that's set, click Export or Save As to save your file.

 
##   What Is a PNG, and Why Won't It Attach to My Email?  
 

PNG, shown as .png at the end of a file, is short for Portable Network Graphics. It's designed to create photos that are “lossless,” which means you can compress them, like in a ZIP file, and when you reopen them, they'll be restored as if they were never squished down in the first place. They also have other useful features, such as being able to retain transparent backgrounds, making them easier to use in photo editing.

 

Open the image in GIMP.

 

Make any edits, such as resizing, filtering, or otherwise that you'd like to do,

 

Go to File > Export As or Save As.

 

In the window that opens, you can either change the file extension at the end to .jpg, or you can click the Save File As drop-down menu and choose JPG from the menu that appears.

 

Once that's set, click Export or Save As to save your file.

 

That can be convenient if you need your photos completely pristine at all times. But it also means PNG files are much bigger than JPG files, which are "lossy." This was and is a problem on the internet, since the bigger the file, the longer it takes to upload and download. If an image isn't going to be compressed repeatedly, and images on websites rarely are, then the site loads faster and the emails go out more easily if they don't let you upload PNG files. Fortunately, turning a PNG into a JPG is easy.
