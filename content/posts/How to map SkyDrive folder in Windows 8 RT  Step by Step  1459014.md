# Unlock the Hidden Power of Windows 8 RT: Learn How to Map Skydrive Folder in Just a Few Clicks!

Are you a Windows 8 RT user who wants to access your SkyDrive folder with ease? Did you know that you can easily map your SkyDrive folder to your Windows 8 RT system in just a few clicks? In this article, we will show you how to do just that!

First, we need to understand what SkyDrive is. SkyDrive is a cloud storage service offered by Microsoft that enables you to store all your documents, photos, and other files securely in the cloud. With SkyDrive, you can easily access your files from any device with an Internet connection.

To map your SkyDrive folder, follow the simple steps below:

Step 1: Launch Windows Explorer

Launch Windows Explorer by pressing the Windows key and the E key at the same time.

Step 2: Open the Map Network Drive Wizard

Click the “Computer” tab on the top menu bar of Windows Explorer. From the drop-down menu, select “Map network drive.” This will open the Map Network Drive Wizard.

Step 3: Choose Your Drive Letter

In the “Map Network Drive” wizard, choose the drive letter that you want to use for your SkyDrive folder. You can choose any available letter, but it's recommended that you use a letter that's easy to remember, such as “S.”

Step 4: Enter Your SkyDrive Folder Location

Next, enter the location of your SkyDrive folder. This should be in the following format: \\d.docs.live.net\YOUR-SKYDRIVE-ID\

To find your SkyDrive ID, simply go to your SkyDrive folder in your web browser and copy the URL. Your SkyDrive ID is the long string of numbers and letters that come after the “cid-” in the URL. For example, if your SkyDrive URL is https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=1234abcd5678efgh, then your SkyDrive ID is “1234abcd5678efgh”.

Step 5: Create Your SkyDrive Folder Shortcut

Finally, check the box next to “Reconnect at sign-in” if you want your SkyDrive folder to be automatically mapped every time you sign in to your computer. Then click the “Finish” button to create your SkyDrive folder shortcut on your computer.

Congratulations! You have now successfully mapped your SkyDrive folder to your Windows 8 RT system. You can access your SkyDrive folder by simply clicking on the shortcut in Windows Explorer.

In conclusion, SkyDrive is a powerful tool that can make your life easier by providing a secure and convenient way to store and access your files from anywhere. By mapping your SkyDrive folder to your Windows 8 RT system, you can take advantage of all the benefits that SkyDrive has to offer. So what are you waiting for? Give it a try today!

While SkyDrive is becoming a major player in the Windows ecosystem as cloud storage solution and a good competitor of Dropbox, Google Drive and Apple’s iCloud, there still some limitations when it comes to Windows RT. For example, both Windows 8 and RT have available the Microsoft’s official SkyDrive app, but Windows 8 is the one that allows you to get access to files through the desktop and within the Windows Store app.
 
Although, if you are up to the task, there is a way to map a SkyDrive folder in Windows RT, that can be really handy in your brand new Surface RT or in any other RT device. The advantage of doing this is that you will not have to jump from one experience to another just to get access to or sync a file. It will become much easier to upload your photos, videos and any other documents. Additionally, in a way, it will expand the storage space in your device for free.  
 
Follow the step-by-step guide below to accomplish this task:
 
## Instructions
 
1. Launch Internet Explorer and sign-in to your SkyDrive account.
 
2. From the left pane, right-click Files and select Copy shortcut (or Copy Link Address in Chrome). If you paste the clipboard content on a text file, you’ll end up with a link similar to this one:
 

 
3. Open the File Explorer, navigate to Computer and from the Ribbon’s menu click or tap the Map network drive option.
 
4. Select a Drive letter that isn’t being used by any of your current devices. In the Folder field type: https://d.docs.live.net/ follow by the CID number next to the link, like this: 
 
Then choose whether to reconnect at sign-in and click Finish.
 
5. Now you’ll be prompted to enter a username and password. Type your SkyDrive email address and type corresponding to the account and click OK.
 
Wait for a short moment and the mounted folder should show up in Computer.
 
That’s basically all you need to do. Now you’ll be able to get access and upload documents from the Windows RT desktop experience. If you prefer, this will also work in Windows 8 Pro or Core.
