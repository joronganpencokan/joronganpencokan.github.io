However, to craft Jungle Armor in Terraria, you will need certain items that are only available in the Jungle Biome. Here are the three of them:
 
- Jungle Spores
 - Vines
 - Stinger

 
In total, you will need 32 Jungle Spores, 2 Vines, and 10 Stingers to craft all three parts of the Jungle Armor. After collecting all these items, simply head over to an Iron Anvil or a Lead Anvil to complete the crafting process. If you don’t know how to find these items, we can help you out. Here’s where you can find all these items in Terraria:
 
### How to Find Jungle Spores
 
Jungle Spores are fairly easy to get in the game. They are found inside glowing green orbs around the biome. You can get it by simply attacking the flowers with your weapon.
 
### How to Find Vines
 
They are dropped from vines who are disguised as man-eaters. There is a much lesser frequency of getting them, 50% to be precise. But since you only need to collect two, it shouldn’t be much of a problem.
 
### How to Find Stingers
 
This item is dropped from Hornets, Dragon Hornets, and Spiked Jungle-Slimes. Since these enemies are quite common, you will get enough Stingers provided you beat them.
