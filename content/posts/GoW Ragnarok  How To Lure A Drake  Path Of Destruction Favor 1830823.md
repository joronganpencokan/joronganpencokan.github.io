# Unleash Ultimate Destruction in God of War Ragnarok by Unleashing the Secret of Luring A Drake - Here's How!

Are you ready to take on a new adventure in God of War Ragnarok? Then it's time to unleash the ultimate destruction by unleashing the secret of luring a Drake. In this article, we will take you through the steps to lure and ride a Drake so you can wreak havoc on your enemies.

First and foremost, you need to find a Drake. These majestic creatures can be found in various locations throughout the game world, so keep your eyes peeled for them. Once you spot one, approach it slowly without spooking it. Make sure to have a few pieces of frozen flame in your inventory as you will need them to lure the Drake.

To lure the Drake, throw a piece of frozen flame in its direction. The Drake will be attracted to the flame and will start to follow it. Keep repeating this process until the Drake is close enough for you to mount it. Once the Drake is close enough, hop on its back and get ready to ride.

The controls for riding the Drake are fairly simple. Use the left joystick to steer and the right joystick to control the pitch and yaw. You can also use the square button to make the Drake breathe fire on your enemies, causing massive damage. Once you've mastered the art of riding the Drake, you can use it to take down even the toughest foes in the game.

In addition to its combat capabilities, riding a Drake also has numerous traversal benefits. The Drake can fly over obstacles such as cliffs and chasms, allowing you to access previously inaccessible locations. It's also a great way to get around the game world quickly, allowing you to cover large distances in a short amount of time.

In conclusion, luring and riding a Drake is a fantastic way to unleash ultimate destruction in God of War Ragnarok. Not only does it provide you with a powerful combat companion, but it also has numerous traversal benefits. So the next time you come across a Drake, don't hesitate to try your hand at taming one. With a bit of practice, you'll be flying through the skies and laying waste to your enemies in no time.

## How to Lure the Drake in GoW Ragnarok
 

 
The quest begins as soon as you enter the cage from the burrow. Use the Leviathan Axe to hit it on the wooden plank with white paint on it as this will temporarily open the gate. Recall the Leviathan Axe right after you hit the wooden plank and hit it on the gear below. This will freeze the cage allowing you to exit and lure the Drake inside in GoW Ragnarok.
 
Also, make sure you don’t recall the Leviathan Axe as you have to keep the cage open. Further, walk through the passage and interact with the gate to open it. You will find a few Drakes there whom you have to lure inside the cage. All you have to do is simply walk near one so that it follows you. Meanwhile, other Drakes will try to attack you but you can eliminate them. This is because luring one Drake will also complete this objective in GoW Ragnarok. Later, when you have successfully lured a Drake inside the cage, quickly head outside and recall the Leviathan Axe. Once the Drake is caged, interact with the chain next to the cage to pull it and move the cage upwards.
 
That’s how to lure the Drake in GoW Ragnarok during the Path of Destruction Favor quest. If you found this article helpful, then make sure to check out our GoW Ragnarok Wiki for more information.
