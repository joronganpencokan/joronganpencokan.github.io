Here's a complete guide to help you master the art of crafting leather in Windbound.

## Gathering Materials

The first step in leather crafting is gathering all the necessary materials. You will need rawhide or animal hide, which can be obtained from animals in Windbound. 

Once you've collected a sufficient amount of hide, you need to craft a tanning rack. This can be done by gathering materials like sticks, stones, and grass. Place these items in your crafting menu to build a tanning rack.

With your tanning rack in place, place the rawhide on the rack to begin the tanning process. This will transform the rawhide into usable leather.

## Crafting Tools

To craft leather items, you'll need certain tools. These include a leatherworking station, needles, dye, and wax. Crafting a leatherworking station is similar to crafting a tanning rack, just with different materials. You will need sticks, stones, and additional materials like grass rope, vines, or shells.

Once you've crafted a leatherworking station, you can start working on your leather crafting projects. You can craft a variety of items like leather shoes, bags, and even armor.

## Crafting Techniques

To create different types of leather items, you will need to master a variety of crafting techniques. Some essential techniques include cutting leather into the desired shape and size, piercing holes, and stitching pieces together. You'll also need to learn how to properly use the dye to get the color you want and how to apply wax to protect and preserve the finished product.

## Practice Makes Perfect

Now that you have all the necessary materials, tools, and techniques, it's time to start practicing. Take the time to master each technique and experiment with different types of leather crafting projects.

Start with simple projects and gradually move on to more complex ones. With each project, you'll gain more confidence and experience, allowing you to create even more impressive leather items.

## Conclusion

While playing Windbound, you will need some leather during your journey. It is a resource in some crucial crafting recipes but where to find Leather in Windbound? Is it a natural resource or do you have to put in some work to make it? Get all the answers you need in this guide on how to make Leather in Windbound.
 
## How to Get Leather in Windbound
 
To answer the first question on your mind, yes, animals are a source of leather (of course). You can get animal skin as a drop from animals after you fight them and eventually beat them. You can fight smaller animals like pigs to avoid putting yourself in too much danger. But you need to remember that not all skin drops can be made into leather.
 
Now, once you have got your hands on some animal hide, you have to do the next step. That is to dry it out. You need to basically cure it over fire and that’s where the campfire comes in.
 
## How to Make a Campfire
 

 
Don’t know how to make a campfire in Windbound? Don’t worry, it is pretty easy. You need 1 thick grass, 1 stick and 2 rocks for it. Gather these resources and craft a fire from the Crafting menu. It will be in the Survival section as you can see in the picture above.
 
After crafting the fire, you have to build it wherever you like. Next, you need a Drying Rack. It can hold up to 3 items at a time. That can be crafted with 2 sticks and 3 thick grass. This will come in handy to cook items on the fire including raw meat.
 
Once you have that, you have to interact with the fire and add the skin to the Drying Rack. Now, it is a waiting game because it will take some time to make the leather. With this newly learned technique, you can make use of leather in a variety of items like an axe, glider, Plainstalker bow, armored bag, bone tipped spear and more.
 
So, here’s a short recap:
 
- Get a skin from an animal
 - Make a fire and create a Drying Rack
