Facebook is a great way to stay connected with friends and family, but it's important to remember that not everything you share should be for public consumption. One of the biggest concerns for Facebook users is the privacy of their photos - how can you make sure that only the people you want to see them have access? Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to keep your Facebook photos private and secure.

1. Check your privacy settings

The first step is to make sure you've adjusted your privacy settings to your liking. You can do this by clicking on the down arrow in the top right corner of any Facebook page and selecting "Settings". From there, select "Privacy" on the left-hand side and make sure you're happy with who can see your future posts and who can see your past posts. You can also adjust settings for things like who can message you and who can search for your profile.

2. Create custom friend lists

One of the best ways to keep your Facebook photos private is to use custom friend lists. This allows you to group your friends into different categories (e.g. family, close friends, acquaintances) and adjust your privacy settings accordingly. For example, you might want to share photos of your kids with close family members but not with everyone on your friends list. To create custom friend lists, go to your profile and click "Friends". From there, you can create new lists and add friends to them.

3. Adjust photo privacy settings

Once you've set up your custom friend lists, you can adjust the privacy settings for individual photos. When you upload a new photo, you'll see a dropdown menu that says "Friends" - this is where you can choose who can see the photo. If you want to limit access to a specific group of people, select "Custom" and then choose the relevant friend list.

4. Review your tagged photos

Another potential privacy risk on Facebook is photos that you've been tagged in by others. To review these, go to your profile and click "Photos". From there, select "Tagged" and you can see all the photos that you're tagged in. If there are any you don't want to be associated with, you can remove the tag or ask the person who posted the photo to take it down.

5. Use the Timeline review feature

Finally, Facebook has a useful feature called Timeline review that lets you approve or reject tags and posts before they're visible on your profile. To access this, go to your profile and click "Settings". From there, select "Timeline and Tagging" on the left-hand side and turn on "Review posts you're tagged in before the post appears on your timeline". This gives you more control over what shows up on your profile.

Following these simple steps can help you keep your Facebook photos private and secure. Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to online privacy. By taking a few minutes to set up your privacy settings and review your tagged photos, you can enjoy all the benefits of Facebook without worrying about who might be seeing your photos.

Putting photos on Facebook is easy, but keeping all those Facebook photos private is another matter.

 

It used to be that Facebook made all photos and posts public by default, meaning anyone could see them. Facebook's privacy settings now give users more granular control over who can see what, but they can also be a bit difficult to figure out.

 
##   Basic Tutorial on Keeping Facebook Photos Private  
 

For Facebook photos, you always have the option to make sure only your friends can view them via the inline privacy button or "audience selector" tool in the post creation box.

 

When you click the down arrow or the button that usually says either Friends or Public, you'll see a list of options for who you want to allow to see the content you are posting.

 

Friends is the setting that most privacy experts recommend. It will allow only those you have connected with on Facebook to see your content. You can also choose to share posts with specific friends or custom lists of friends.

 

There are other photo privacy settings you can change, as well. You can review any photo in which someone has "tagged" you before the content appears on your Timeline, and you can change the sharing settings for photos and albums that have already been published.

 

You may want to make sure that your default Facebook sharing option is set to Friends, rather than Public. To do this, navigate to the Facebook Privacy Settings, where you can adjust a variety of other privacy settings as well.

 
##   How to Make Previously Published Facebook Photos Private  
 

Even after you have published a photo on Facebook, you can go back and change the privacy setting to restrict viewing to fewer people or expand the viewing audience. You can either do this globally by changing the privacy setting for everything you have posted, or individually by changing the privacy settings on each photo or photo album you've posted.

 

To do this, navigate to the photo in question and select the three-dot icon in the upper-right corner, and then select Edit audience or Edit post audience.

 
##   Change Photo Album Privacy Settings  
 

You can easily change the privacy setting for any photo album you've created.

 
- Go to your Timeline or profile page, then select the Photos tab from the top menu bar.
 - Select Albums.
 - Select the three-dot icon for the album you'd like to edit and select Edit Album.
 - Beneath Edit Album on the lefthand side, select your preferred audience.

 
##   Tags and Facebook Photos: Managing Your Privacy  
 

Facebook offers tags as a way to identify or name people in photos and status updates. This way Facebook can link particular users to a photo or status update published on Facebook.

 
Review Facebook's tagging and privacy settings for more info on how to adjust the privacy and visibility settings for your posts.
 

Go to your Timeline or profile page, then select the Photos tab from the top menu bar.

 

Select Albums.

 

Select the three-dot icon for the album you'd like to edit and select Edit Album.

 

Beneath Edit Album on the lefthand side, select your preferred audience.

 

Many Facebook users tag their friends and even themselves in the photos they post because it makes those photos more visible to those who are in it and easier for others to find.

 

Facebook provides a few settings for changing how tags work. From the Facebook privacy settings, you can change who can see the post that you are tagged in on your timeline. You can also set who the audience should be for posts that you get tagged in. These settings can be found under Account (down arrow) > Settings & Privacy > Settings > Timeline and Tagging.
