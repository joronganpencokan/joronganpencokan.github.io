News recently emerged of a disturbing trend with regards to social media and online privacy: government agencies requesting private information from these platforms in order to track down suspects of crimes. This trend, commonly referred to as the "Big Brother" phenomenon by some, is a worrying indication of how much governments are willing to disregard individual privacy in the name of security.

According to reports, law enforcement agencies have been making increasing requests to social media companies for user data over the last few years. This data includes things such as IP addresses, phone numbers, and even social security numbers, all of which can be used to track exactly who is behind a certain online account. Social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google have indicated that they receive hundreds of thousands of requests for user data each year, with government and law enforcement agencies being the most frequent initiators of these requests.

The implications of this trend are troubling in several ways. Firstly, it puts into question the level of accountability that governments have for respecting individual privacy online. Not only that, but it may have a chilling effect on free speech and expression. It is no secret that individuals may be more reluctant to express their views on social media if they know that they are being monitored by government agencies. This could lead to self-censorship and ultimately limit the diversity of opinions and voices that are expressed online.

Moreover, it is clear that social media companies themselves are struggling to balance the demands of government agencies with user privacy concerns. They are often put in a difficult position, with demands for user data coming in from all sides. While these companies may be legally obligated to comply with these requests, it is important that they also take a stand for their users' privacy and push back against any unreasonable demands by the government. 

Overall, it is clear that the "Big Brother" phenomenon with regards to social media is an alarming trend that needs to be carefully monitored by all those interested in online privacy and free speech. As technology becomes more integrated into our daily lives, it is our responsibility to ensure that individual privacy and free expression are not sacrificed in the name of security.

There was recently a standoff between the United States government and Twitter. A Twitter handle was posting messages that were critical of the new administration’s immigration policies, and the government issued a summons that ordered the social network to produce the personal information of the holder of the account. Twitter sued to block the action, and the government withdrew their demand.
 
This is after several accounts have been created to coincide with the new administration. They all claim to be “rogue” government employees who have the inside track. But if governments were allowed to demand social media information, could it have further effects on average citizens? We asked some of our writers, “Should governments be allowed to force social media to divulge personal info on accounts?”
 
## Our Opinion
 
Trevor gives a resounding “no” to this question. He notes, “Once the force is used one time, they will keep asking for more and more.” While it may begin as just for certain circumstances, it could turn into something that is always expected.
 
Phil explains that the “government is always going to push for more access to private online areas, usually under the guise of security, but when it’s just pandering to the ego of the commander in chief, they will always be in a bit of a sticky wicket.” He believes this sort of thing will become less and less attractive to the government as long as citizens speak up for their rights. He points to the quote, “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men should do nothing.”
 

 
Simon thinks the whole thing sounds scary! He agrees with Phil and believes that they would “use the excuse of protecting people from threats to security as their main motive.” He also sees that it shows they’re just interested in “shutting down people who go against the current government.” While right now social media is a great place to get news and express opinions, if the government obtains this ability, it will lead to “people being shut down for speaking against how the country is run as a whole.”
 
Corbin thinks this should only be allowed when it comes to a matter of national security. “Even then, the likelihood of affecting national security is not a quantifiable amount which opens the issue to be taken advantage of.”
 
I have to say I agree with the others on this. I think it would be a very dangerous precedent to set. If you allow it one time, the government is only going to keep on using that newfound power. I, too, think it should only be used if it’s something tantamount to national security or extreme danger, meaning they could stop deaths from happening if they divulge the information. But certainly it shouldn’t be used just to find out who’s being critical of the administration.
 
## Your Opinion
 
Let’s hear from everyone else on this topic. Do you see no good coming from the government gaining this ability? What if they were able to do it in times of national security? Do you worry about your own information getting caught up in this? Should governments be allowed to force social media to divulge personal info on accounts?
