# Unlock The Secret to Crafting A Killer Soundcloud Playlist That Will Keep You Jamming All Night Long!

Music has the power to unlock a range of emotions that can make us happy, sad, feel inspired, or even motivated. Soundcloud is one of the most popular music streaming platforms that has taken the world by storm. With over 76 million registered users worldwide, the platform is quickly becoming the go-to place where music lovers and artists connect.

Whether you are hosting your next party or want to create a playlist that can keep you jamming all night long, crafting a killer Soundcloud playlist is a must. In this article, we will take you through the steps that can help unlock the secrets to crafting a playlist that will keep you grooving all night long.

## Step 1: Know your audience

The first step to creating a killer Soundcloud playlist is to know your audience. Whether you are hosting a party or creating a playlist for your personal use, knowing your audience is critical. Ask yourself, "Who will be listening to this playlist? What kind of music do they prefer?"

For instance, if you are creating a playlist for a party, consider the type of event you are hosting. Is it a laid-back affair or an all-out dance party? Knowing the mood of the event can help you choose the type of music that will appeal to your audience.

## Step 2: Find the right balance

Once you have a clear understanding of your audience, the next step is to find the right balance. A killer playlist should have a mix of familiar tracks that your audience knows and loves and new songs that they may not have heard before. Some people prefer to stick to one genre, while others enjoy a mix of different genres. Strike a balance that works for your audience by mixing up the tempo, mood, and rhythm of the songs.

## Step 3: Create a theme

Creating a theme for your playlist can help tie everything together seamlessly. A theme could be anything from a genre, era, or vibe. For instance, if you are creating a playlist for a beach party, consider a playlist with tropical house, reggae, and beach rock. On the other hand, if you are creating a slow jam playlist, you can opt for tracks with a slow tempo and soft rhythm.

## Step 4: Keep it fresh

Keeping your playlist fresh is critical, especially if you'll be listening to it often. Update your playlist regularly with new songs that you’ve discovered and noteworthy music from emerging artists. Look for popular tracks on Soundcloud and add them to your playlist to give it a fresh twist.

## Step 5: Be creative with your playlist name

The playlist name is an essential element of crafting a killer Soundcloud playlist. Be creative and witty with your playlist name. A catchy name can attract attention and evoke a sense of curiosity from your audience.

In conclusion, creating a killer Soundcloud playlist is as easy as knowing your audience, finding the right balance, creating a theme, keeping it fresh, and being creative with your playlist name. Follow these steps, and you'll be well on your way to crafting a playlist that will keep you jamming all night long, whether it’s for a party or your personal use.

## Make A Playlist On SoundCloud
 
For this, you can either use your desktop or mobile phone. We have mentioned the steps for both in the article below.
 
### Using Computer
 
1. On your browser visit the SoundCloud site and login into your account if not done already. Now search for the song you want to add in your playlist.
 
2. Select the song once you find it. The song will open in the new page. Here, click on the Add to Playlist button. If you cannot find it then select More and click on Add to Playlist.
 

 
3. Next, on the new window, you can either add this song to an existing playlist or you can select the Create a Playlist tab to make a new playlist. Now give your new playlist a name and select your privacy option (Public or Private). Then click on Save.
 
4. With this, the new playlist is created. You can select Go to Playlist to view your playlist or simply click on the X icon at the top right corner to close this tab.
 
In the future, if you want to add more songs to this playlist then you can follow the same steps. But in step No.3, select Add to Playlist instead of Create a Playlist to add a song to an already created playlist.
 
### Using Mobile App
 
We are using an iPhone to create a playlist on the SoundCloud app. However, you can follow the same steps on Android as well.
 
1. Open the SoundCloud app on your phone and search for a song. Once you find a song, play it. The playing song can be seen at the bottom of the screen. Tap on it to open the song in a full-screen player.
 
2. Here, tap on the three dots icon at the bottom right corner. A new options menu will appear, select the Add to Playlist. 
 
3. Now select an already created playlist or tap on the + icon to add or create a new playlist.
 
4. Next, give it a name and then tap on Done. With this, your playlist will be created.
 
Note: On the SoundCloud Android app, you can also check the Private box and then tap on Done to make this playlist private. While on iPhone the created playlist is by default set to Private, but you can change it to Public later.
 
With this, you have successfully created a playlist on the SoundCloud mobile app.
 
## View Your Playlists
 
Once you have successfully created the playlist, it’s now time to view it.

1. Go to your SoundCloud account and select your profile from the top right corner. Now from the drop-down menu select Playlists.
 
2. On the next page, you can see all the playlists created and liked by you.

## Make Your Playlist Public Or Private
 
Although you get the option to choose whether you want to make your playlist public or private while creating a playlist. But, you can always change the privacy settings on the SoundCloud playlist whenever you want.
 
### Change Privacy On SoundCloud Web
 
1. On your SoundCloud Playlist page select a playlist you want to make private or public. On the next page click on the Edit button.
 
2. As you do that, a new tab will open. Here, under Basic Info you can edit the playlist like renaming it, adding Genre and providing Additional tags, etc. Most importantly you can change the privacy settings, choose the Private or Public option and once you are done select Save Changes.
 
### Make SoundCloud Playlist Public On Mobile
 
Note: You cannot change your playlist privacy on the Android app. However, if you have made your playlist private while creating it, then you can log in to the SoundCloud Web and change the privacy from there.
