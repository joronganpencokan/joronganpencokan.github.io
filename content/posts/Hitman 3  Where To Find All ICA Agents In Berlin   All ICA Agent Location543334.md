# You Won't Believe Where the Secret ICA Agents are Hiding in Hitman 3's Berlin - Find Them All Now!

The world of Hitman 3 is full of mysteries and secrets waiting to be uncovered. The Berlin level is no exception, offering hidden surprises and challenges to those who dare to explore. One of the biggest secrets in the game revolves around the ICA agents, who are hiding in plain sight. In this article, we'll show you how to find them all and unlock their mysteries.

Before we dive into the specifics, let's review what ICA agents are. The International Contract Agency, or ICA for short, is a covert organization that serves as the main employer of Agent 47, the game's protagonist. The ICA recruits agents with unique skills from around the world, with missions ranging from assassinations to espionage.

Now, onto the task at hand. In the Berlin level, players are tasked with infiltrating an abandoned club and eliminating their targets. However, the real fun begins when players explore the level further to find the hidden ICA agents.

The first ICA agent can be found near the start of the level, hiding behind a large wooden crate. To find him, players need to head to the parking lot area and look for the crate near the scaffolding. Once you have found him, subdue or eliminate him. 

The second ICA agent is hiding in the kitchen behind the bar in the club. To get there, players must maneuver through the crowds of dancing party-goers to reach the back of the club. Once there, climb on top of the bar and head towards the back of the kitchen. Keep an eye out for a cook who is secretly an ICA agent. Subdue or eliminate them to reveal the hidden area behind the kitchen.

The third and final ICA agent is hiding in the basement of the club's main office. To get there, players must locate the office on the second floor and hack into the computer's security system to open the door to the basement. Once inside, head to the back of the room and look for a hidden doorway behind some boxes. This leads to a secret ICA agent who is monitoring the club's security cameras. Subdue or eliminate him to complete the mission.

Each of the ICA agents has a unique backstory and secret mission. By eliminating or subduing them, players can access new challenges and opportunities in the Berlin level. Some of these challenges include stealing a secret briefcase, accessing hidden information, or even taking out a rival agent.

In conclusion, the Berlin level in Hitman 3 is full of hidden surprises and challenges. The ICA agents, in particular, offer a unique and engaging experience for players looking to explore the level further. With their secret missions and backstories, finding and eliminating them is a task worth undertaking. So what are you waiting for? Start your mission today and check out what Hitman 3 has to offer.
