Unlock iPhone's Hidden Feature: The Secret to Keeping Texts Unread - Revealed!

If you're like most people, you probably rely on your smartphone to keep in touch with friends, family, and colleagues. But, have you ever received a message that you didn't want to read or respond to right away? Maybe you were busy with something else, or maybe you just didn't feel like dealing with the message at that particular moment. Whatever the reason, you don't need to worry about appearing rude or unresponsive because we have a solution for you!

Did you know that there is a hidden feature on iPhones that allows you to keep messages unread until you're ready to respond? It's true! And it's easier to use than you might think. In this article, we'll show you how to unlock this secret function and explain how it can be a game-changer for managing your messages.

First, let's talk about why this feature is so great. When you keep a message unread, it remains highlighted and bolded in your messaging app, indicating that you haven't read it yet. This can be helpful for a few reasons. For one, it serves as a visual reminder that you have an outstanding message to attend to. And, by not opening the message, you won't generate a "read receipt," which can be a helpful way to avoid unnecessary communication.

So, how do you keep a message unread on your iPhone? Here are the steps:

Step 1: Long-press on the message that you want to keep unread.

Step 2: Tap the "Mark as Unread" option.

That's it! The message will now stay highlighted and bolded in your messaging app until you open it. And, if you're worried about forgetting about the message altogether, you can always set a reminder for yourself to revisit the message at a later time.

One thing to note is that this feature is only available in certain messaging apps on the iPhone. Specifically, it works in the following apps: iMessage, Messages, and WhatsApp. If you're using a different messaging app, you may not have access to this function.

So, there you have it: the secret to keeping texts unread on your iPhone. It's a simple but powerful tool that can help you manage your messages and communication more effectively. Give it a try and see how it works for you!

In conclusion, modern smartphones are equipped with a lot of functional features that often go unnoticed. By learning how to use some of these hidden features, you can make your phone work smarter and save time in your daily life. We hope that this article has been helpful in revealing one of the iPhone's lesser-known functions. Give it a try and see how it can help you stay on top of your messages!

This article provides step-by-step instructions for three ways to mark text messages as unread on an iPhone running iOS 16 or higher. With this information, you can flag messages to return to later when you have time to read and respond to them.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Mark as text as unread: Messages > conversation view > Edit > Select Messages > tap conversation > Unread.Another option: Messages > conversation view > swipe left to right > tap blue icon.Lastly: Messages > conversation view > long press > Mark as Unread.

 
##   How to Mark a Text as Unread on iPhone  
 

Starting in iOS 16 (and in iPadOS 16 on the iPad), you can mark text messages as unread in the pre-installed Messages texting app (you can also pin conversations to the top of the window and mute notifications for them). If you're running an earlier version of iOS on your iPhone, you don't have this feature and this is one of many good reasons to upgrade your OS.

 
- Go to the Messages view that shows all of your conversations. If you're in a conversation, tap the arrow in the top left corner.
 - From this screen, there are three ways to mark a text as unread. For the first, tap Edit > Select Messages > tap each conversation you want to mark as unread > Unread.
 - For another option, swipe left to right across the conversation to reveal the blue message icon. Keep swiping or tap the icon.
 - For a conversation that is marked as unread, repeat this action and you can mark it as read without opening the chat.
 - Lastly, long press the conversation and tap Mark as Unread from the pop-up menu.

 
###   Unread Text Messages and Read Receipts  
 

Some Messages users have enabled Read Receipts, a feature that lets the person who they're texting with know when they've read the text the other person has sent. Marking a text as unread using these instructions doesn't change the status of a Read Receipt.

 

Go to the Messages view that shows all of your conversations. If you're in a conversation, tap the arrow in the top left corner.

 

From this screen, there are three ways to mark a text as unread. For the first, tap Edit > Select Messages > tap each conversation you want to mark as unread > Unread.

 

For another option, swipe left to right across the conversation to reveal the blue message icon. Keep swiping or tap the icon.

 
For a conversation that is marked as unread, repeat this action and you can mark it as read without opening the chat.
 

Lastly, long press the conversation and tap Mark as Unread from the pop-up menu.

 
All three ways to mark texts as unread can also be used for two other useful ways to manage your text messages (if you're swiping across the conversation, go from right to left instead). You can Pin a conversation to the top of your Messages window or mute a conversation so a busy chat doesn't spam you with a ton of notifications (tap the bell with the line through it).
 

If you have read a text and a Read Receipt has been sent (you'll see the status just below the latest text within the conversation), marking the text doesn't change what the person you're talking to sees. They still get the Read Receipt. Marking as unread only changes the status of the message on your iPhone.

 
##   How to Filter Messages to Show Only Unread Texts on iPhone  
 

If you only want to see unread texts, here's the setting to change:

 
- Go to Settings > Messages.
 - Move Filter Unknown Senders to on/green.
 - In Messages, tap Filters in the top left corner.
 - Your texts are now grouped based on whether you know the sender or don't (a great way to avoid spam texts), if messages are recently deleted, and if messages are unread.
 - Tap Unread Messages to see only the conversations that have texts marked as unread in them.
