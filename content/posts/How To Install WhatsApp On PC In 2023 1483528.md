Now as we already know, there are two official ways to achieve this. One with the WhatsApp Web and another with the Official WhatsApp Desktop Application. So let’s see how.

Now open WhatsApp on your phone, and then tap on the three dots at the top. Now from the menu, select WhatsApp Web.4. Before scanning the code, checkmark the box under the barcode on the web browser showing Keep me signed in.

5. Within seconds you will see your chats are loaded and ready to be used.
 
You can also turn on the desktop notifications to get alerts for new messages.
 
### Using WhatsApp Official Desktop Application
 
- Download the WhatsApp application from their official website here. Once the downloading is finished, install the setup.After installation is complete, the application will open itself. And again like the web browser you will see the barcode.Scan the barcode just like the above method and your WhatsApp account will be active and running on the PC in no time. Unlike Web, you don’t need to enable the notifications, it will be shown automatically which you can disable from settings.

 
### Benefits Of Using WhatsApp On PC
 
It best for people who are busy working on their PC and are unable to check the device for messages all the time. Or someone who prefers chatting using the physical keyboard, rather than typing on the mobile screen. Moreover, you can share the files stored on your computer directly on WhatsApp without having to transfer them to your phone.
 
In case, you wish or prefer using the Android emulators to install WhatsApp then you can use Bluestacks and its alternatives.
 
### Limitations Of WhatsApp Web Or Desktop App Vs Mobile App
 
It works exactly the same as it works on mobile phones, you can set the About, display picture, chat wallpaper, etc. but there are few options listed below that you can’t access on a web or desktop app:
