* **Ctrl + C**

### Paste Shortcut

To paste the copied text or image, move to the location where you want to paste it and press the following shortcut keys:

* **Ctrl + V**

Note: The Ctrl key on a Chromebook is marked as "Control."

## Other Key Shortcuts

Chromebooks come with several other keyboard shortcuts that can make your life easier. Here are some of them:

* **Ctrl + A** - Select all
* **Ctrl + X** - Cut
* **Ctrl + Z** - Undo
* **Ctrl + Y** - Redo
* **Ctrl + T** - Open a new tab
* **Ctrl + W** - Close the current tab
* **Ctrl + Shift + T** - Reopen the last closed tab
* **Ctrl + Shift + Q** - Lock your screen

## Conclusion

In conclusion, learning keyboard shortcuts can save time and improve productivity while using your Chromebook. Knowing how to copy and paste like a pro is just one of the many shortcuts that can make a significant difference in your workflow. So, try out these shortcuts and discover how they can make your life easier.

You can copy and paste on Chromebooks using keyboard shortcuts or through the context menu that appears when you right-click text or images. If you have a touch-screen device, or if your Chromebook doesn't have touchpad buttons, you can still copy and paste.

 
##   How to Select and Copy Text on a Chromebook  
 

Copying and pasting text selections on a Chromebook is straightforward. Find the text you want to copy and select it. With the text selected, you can copy it with either a key combination or by right-clicking.

 

Here's how to copy and paste a text selection on a Chromebook using the right-click method:

 
- Locate text you want like to copy. The text can be on a webpage, in an email, or in any other document that allows you to select text.
 - Left-click the left edge of the text you want to select.
 - With the left touchpad button held down, drag the cursor on the screen to the right until you have selected the relevant text.
 - With the text selected, right-click anywhere on the selection.
 - If your touchpad has no right mouse button, hold Alt while clicking. You can also tap the touchpad with two fingers instead of one to right-click. To right-click on a touchscreen, hold your finger to the screen instead of tapping it.
 - Select Copy from the context menu.
 - Open the file you want to paste the text into. This could be an email, a Google Docs file, or anything else that allows you to paste text.
 - Right-click where you want to paste the text and select Paste from the context menu.

The Chrome OS 89 update adds an enhanced clipboard, which saves your five most recently copied items. To bring up the enhanced clipboard, press the Launcher key + V, then select the item you wish to paste. If you don't have access to this feature, you can enable it in your Chrome flag settings.

 
If your touchpad only has one button or the entire touchpad clicks, it's a left-click by default.

It's easy to remember Ctrl + C since the C stands for copy. Ctrl + V can be harder to remember, but it may be useful to think of the V as standing for velcro. This command cannot use Ctrl + P because that's used for printing.
