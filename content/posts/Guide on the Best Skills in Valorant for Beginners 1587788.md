Are you new to the world of Valorant, the wildly popular online tactical shooter game? Or maybe you've played a few games but find yourself struggling to improve your skills and climb the ranks? Whether you're a complete newbie or a seasoned player looking to step up your game, we've got the ultimate beginner's guide to mastering Valorant skills – and becoming the pro you always knew you could be!

## Understanding the Basics

Before we dive into more advanced strategies and techniques, it's important to have a solid foundation of the basic mechanics and gameplay rules in Valorant.

### Know Your Agents

Valorant is unique from other shooter games in that players select an "agent" at the beginning of each game – each with its own unique set of abilities and play styles. As a beginner, it's important to try out a few different agents and figure out which one suits your personal play style.

### Understanding the Map

Maps are a key aspect of Valorant's gameplay, and a deep understanding of the map you're playing on can give you a major advantage over your opponents. Take time to explore each map, memorizing key points and chokepoints, and developing a sense of where enemies are likely to be hiding.

### Practice Your Shooting

At its core, Valorant is a game about shooting – so it's essential to develop your aim and control over your weapons. Practice shooting bots in the game's "shooting range" mode, paying attention to your crosshair placement and recoil control.

## Advanced Techniques and Strategies

Once you've got the basics down, it's time to start exploring more advanced techniques that can help take your game to the next level.

### Mastering Movement

In Valorant, movement is a key aspect of both offense and defense. Learn the different ways you can move around the map – crouching, running, jumping, and sliding – and practice incorporating these movements into your gameplay. Experiment with "peeking" around corners, using cover effectively, and baiting out your opponents.

### Team Coordination

Valorant is a team-based game, and effective communication and coordination with your teammates can be the difference between victory and defeat. Practice communicating clearly with your teammates, using "callouts" to describe enemy positions and alerting your team to any opportunities or dangers.

### Developing Game Sense

Finally, to truly master Valorant, you need to develop a deep "game sense" – an intuitive understanding of the game's mechanics, its flow and pacing, and the strategies and tactics that are most effective in different situations. To develop your game sense, watch professional players and learn from their gameplay tactics and strategies.

### Conclusion

Whether you're a complete beginner or a seasoned player looking to step up your game, mastering Valorant skills takes time, practice, and dedication. But with these tips and techniques, you'll be well on your way to unleashing your inner pro and dominating the competition in no time!

For almost all CS: GO players, it was a little unusual to start their journey in Valorant. And this happens because, in addition to shooting, they have to always pay attention to their abilities. Many streamers and professional players have already mastered all the mechanics, but most beginners still have a lot of work to do. In today’s TOP, we will tell you about four tricky abilities that will help you better understand Valorant.
 
## 1. Parkour by Omen
 
We will start our Valorant skills guide with Paranoia Omen. Truly saying, this is a powerful ability that is rarely used in the game. The main task of Paranoia is to worsen the view of the enemy since the ability acts almost like a stun grenade.
 
However, there is another plus of this ability. When using it, you bounce a little higher than usual. This allows you to jump to positions that you cannot reach with a normal jump, so you can take places that are unexpected for opponents.
 
To do this, you need to come in a distance of about a meter to the object you want to jump onto, press the ability key, and make a normal jump. But during the ability you cannot shoot, so you need to be careful. The position should be really unexpected. You can even jump onto the Sage wall.
 
## 2. The Combination of Sova and Raze
 
We will continue our Valorant guide with this combination. An unusual combo was accidentally discovered by the Reddit Botswagloaf. He tried to launch the Sova’s Recon Dart, but it accidentally joined the Raze drone. Recon Dart continued to work, essentially becoming a locator that moves on the map, and even causes damage to enemies. Of course, in order to use this, you need good teammates. But if you play with a friend, then you should definitely try this.
 
## 3. Sage Slowdown
 
Sage is not only the coolest healer and support but also one of the most powerful characters in Valorant. In addition to being able to completely heal health after a shootout, you can intelligently use your other Slow Orb ability, which newcomers often neglect. Scattering Slow Orb is like flash and smokes in CS: GO. The main thing is to choose the right place and timing.
 
## 4. Smoke Master Viper
 
Imagine that in CS: GO you would have the opportunity to buy several smoke grenades at once. And we can say that in Valorant, Viper has such an ability. He is the specialist of grenades. But first, you of course need to study how to use them correctly.
 
We hope you found our Valorant tips helpful. And if you still experience difficulties with the game, which is common for all new players, then you need to keep training. Soon you will be able to deal with your enemies. For more tips and tricks check our Valorant Wiki Guide.
