Say Goodbye to Clicking Blindly: Google's Instant Previews will Revolutionize Your Browsing Experience!

You have probably experienced the frustration of clicking on a website link, only to find out that it is not what you were looking for. It's a common occurrence for most internet users, and Google has realized this problem. Therefore, the company has introduced a new feature called "Instant Previews," which allows users to see a preview of a website before clicking on it.

What are Instant Previews?

Instant Previews are a feature on Google's search engine that allows users to see a preview of the website before clicking on it. By hovering over a search result, a small preview image of the webpage will appear on the right side of the page.

How Instant Previews Works

Instant Previews runs a screenshot of the page in question, which is taken at the time of indexing the page. This preview comes up as soon as a user hovers over the title of the page in the search results. The preview is a small snapshot of the webpage, allowing the user to see a glimpse of what to expect.

Benefits of Instant Previews

1. Saves time and reduces frustration- With Instant Previews, users can quickly and easily see what a webpage is about without committing to clicking on it. Instead of clicking on multiple links, users can preview the pages and find the information they need, saving time and reducing frustration.

2. Better decision-making- Instant Previews enable users to make better decisions about the websites they visit. Users can easily identify websites they previously visited and avoid those with pop-ups or a slow loading time.

3. Improved search experience- By previewing the search results, users can quickly eliminate irrelevant results and focus on the ones that are most useful.

4. Accessibility- Instant Previews are also beneficial to individuals who are visually impaired. With this feature, they can visually identify a webpage's content, improving their browsing experience.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Google's Instant Previews feature has revolutionized the browsing experience of its users. From saving time and reducing frustration to better decision-making, the feature comes with many benefits. It's worth noting that Instant Previews work best on desktops and laptops; however, it can also be used on mobile devices, although the experience may not be as comprehensive. By using Instant Previews, you can say goodbye to clicking blindly and enjoy a faster, more efficient browsing experience.

If Google Instant was not enough, in an effort to provide an even faster search results and a more useful user experience, today Google is expanding its search result functionality with the introduction of Instant Previews. Now you will be able to preview an image-based snapshot of the website page that you intent to visit, before clicking the link.
 
It is pretty easy to notice if Instant Previews is enabled for you to use. Just look for a magnifying glass next to your search result, if not follow this link to try it out.
 
To see Google Instant Previews in action, the user needs to hover with the mouse or click the magnifying glass for the snapshot to appear in the right hand side. Not for every search result, but accompanying the snapshot you will also be able to find a text call out, in orange, bringing up some text from the web page with your search term, that will help you to determine if that is what you are looking for.
 
Google Instant Previews is not for speeding up terms look up, but rather help you to make a better decision on what you’re searching.
 
From The Official Google Blog:
 
Google is rolling out Instant Previews today, but it might take a few days to reach everyone. Also Instant Previews will be available in 40 languages.
 
“Here are some of the things you can do to get the most out of Instant Previews:
 
- Quickly compare results – A visual comparison of search results helps you pick the one that’s right for you. Quickly flip through previews to see which page looks best.
 - Pinpoint relevant content – Text callouts, in orange, will sometimes highlight where your search terms appear on the webpage so you can evaluate if it’s what you’re looking for.
 - Interact with the results page – Page previews let you see the layout of a webpage before clicking the search result. Looking for a chart, picture, map or list? See if you can spot one in the preview.”
