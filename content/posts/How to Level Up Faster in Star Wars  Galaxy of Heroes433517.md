Unleash Your Force! Discover the Ultimate Cheat Code to Level Up Faster in Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes

Are you a Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes player looking for a way to level up faster and become the ultimate warrior in the galaxy? Look no further, for we have uncovered the ultimate cheat code that will help you in your quest to become the strongest player in the game.

The first step in leveling up faster is understanding the importance of investing in your characters. One of the most common mistakes players make is focusing on too many characters at once, which can lead to a lack of progress in the long run. Choose a handful of powerful characters and focus on developing them before branching out to others.

Another important aspect of leveling up faster is understanding the value of gear. Gear is essential in enhancing the strength of your characters and progressing through the game. Make sure to consistently farm gear and equip it to your characters to give them the edge they need to succeed.

The ultimate cheat code to level up faster in Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes lies in taking advantage of special events and daily activities. The game offers a variety of events that provide rare items, experiences, and rewards that can significantly boost your progression. Daily activities such as battles and challenges provide valuable experience and currency that can be used to enhance your characters.

It is also important to utilize the game’s guild system to your advantage. Joining a guild can provide a community of players that you can exchange ideas with and battle alongside. Working together with guildmates can also lead to access to exclusive rewards and bonuses that can help level up your characters faster.

Of course, there is no substitute for good old-fashioned practice. The more you play, the better you will become at the game. Continuously challenging yourself in battles and coming up with new strategies will not only help you level up faster but also make you a better player overall.

In conclusion, if you want to level up faster in Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, invest in your characters, consistently farm gear, take advantage of special events and daily activities, use the guild system to your advantage, and practice endlessly. Unleash your force and conquer the galaxy!

Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes is a role-playing game from Electronic Arts that lets you collect a massive assortment of heroes and villains from across the Star Wars universe. It's available exclusively on mobile devices, and while it might feel familiar to fans of other mobile free-to-play RPGs, there's something decidedly fantastic about collecting Wookies and droids instead of warriors and mages.

 

You need to unlock Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes' many modes to experience the full game, and you can't do that until you've reached a high enough player level to unlock each one. These tips will help you speed up the process.

 
##   Daily Activities  
 

Leveling up in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes is tied directly to how many experience points you earn, and the single best way to earn experience points is by completing your Daily Activities list. If you're looking to level up quickly, treat this as the checklist you need to complete every day before exploring any other part of the game.

 
These tips apply to both the Android and iOS versions of Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes.
 

Every task on this list helps you further your progress in other ways, too, so do things in an order that complements your Daily Activities list. If you can earn 40 XP for completing three light battles, and another 40 XP for completing three dark battles, don't just keep grinding away on the light side (or dark side) campaign. Do the three light and three dark, then go back to grinding wherever you like. Just make sure you're checking off the other activities as you do. Everything you do, every day, needs to be in service to this list until it's completed.

 
##   Schedule Your Play  
 

Certain tasks on your list come equipped with wait timers, so schedule your play accordingly. If you need to complete three arena battles, for example, there's a lengthy wait timer between each. Tackle one at the beginning of your play session, then work on other assignments as you wait for the timer to cool down.

 

Similarly, in the game's earliest stages, you can get a free Bronzium Data Card every 20 minutes. As you play, keep an eye on that countdown timer and grab every free card you can. These can contain everything from free characters and character shards to equipment and credits. All of this helps make your team stronger in some way, which makes it easier to win battles and earn more of that level-upping XP.

 
##   Let the Game Play Itself  
 

Like most free-to-play games, the challenge in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes suffers from peaks and valleys. When things get a little too easy and your team is overpowered for the task at hand, just hit the Auto button in the corner and let the AI take over. Battles complete faster once decision-making is taken out of the process, and so long as your team is strong enough, you'll three-star every stage. 

 

If this sounds like a strategy that makes the game less fun, that's a fair complaint. But there's no denying this works wonders when you don't actually have time to focus on the game.

 
##   A Little Purchase Goes a Long Way  
 

If you're absolutely unwilling to spend any money in a free-to-play game, this tip isn't for you. If you don't mind spending a little to get ahead, though, keep reading.

 
If you're on the hunt for a specific piece of equipment to upgrade a character's Gear Level, don't be afraid to use your Sim tickets. That's what they're there for. They let you skip the battle entirely and go straight to the rewards.
 

Currency purchases are always available in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, but they're far from the best way to get bang for your buck. You're periodically offered a variety of bundles as you play that are only available for a limited time. These come in a wide range of prices and offerings, and if you see one that suits your liking, get it. Not only does this add some much-needed characters to your roster, but you get training droids and the credits needed to complete the training process. There are enough rewards in even a small bundle to max out a few of your characters early in the game (at least, as maxed out as they can get at that point), which makes battles much easier to complete.

 
##   Sweat the Details  
 

From squad battles and challenges to the standard campaign missions, everything in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes gives you goodies and XP, and the goodies themselves almost always make it easier to get more XP. But what are all of these doodads and equipment you unlock, and why should you care?

 

They're really the heart of what Galaxy of Heroes is about.

 

Equipping characters not only makes them stronger, it opens up a path to unlocking new abilities. Building a team made not of your favorite heroes but of the characters whose attacks and styles support each other can mean all of the difference between success and failure. Knowing which currencies buy more of what, which character shards you need the least of to unlock a new fighter, and how much longer until your next challenge unlocks—it all layers together to form a single cohesive experience. 

 

If played in the most shallow sense, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes is a game of automated combat and little else. Scratch beneath the surface, though, and you find a game with many moving parts. Understanding those parts, and how they all serve the greater good that is your Daily Activities list, is the key to leveling up faster and enjoying everything the game has to offer.
