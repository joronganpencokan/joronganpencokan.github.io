##   How to Create External Templates for Google Slides  
 

Unlike working with Google Docs and Google Sheets, you cannot simply copy and paste the contents of a locally-created customized presentation into a Google Slides file. Instead, upload them in the supported .odp format. With a bit of work, you can use customized templates created with LibreOffice or MS Office.

 

Because you cannot add new templates to the Slides Template Gallery, you first need to create a new folder that will house the customized templates.

 

To create a locally-created customized template, do the following:

 
- Open Google Drive. Select New+ > Folder. Name the folder Slides Templates and select Create. This only has to be done once.
 - Create a new custom template in your locally-installed application.
 - When finished, click File > Save as (or type Ctrl + Shift + A).
 - Select ODF Presentation (.odp) as the file format.
 - Because Google Slides doesn’t support MS Office file format, you have to save the files with the .odp file extension.
 - Name your presentation template something fitting for its usage.
 - Go to the Google Drive Slides Templates folder.
 - Click + and then click File upload.
 - Locate the newly created template file and upload it to the folder.

 
##   How to Use Your Custom Templates  
 

Now that you’ve created and uploaded your new template, you can’t just open it and start adding content. If you do that, the template is no longer a template, but regular presentation file. Instead, do the following:
