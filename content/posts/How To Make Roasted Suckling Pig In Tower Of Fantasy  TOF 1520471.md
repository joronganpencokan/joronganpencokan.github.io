Ingredients

To make this dish, you will need the following ingredients:

1 whole suckling pig (4-5 pounds)

1 cup soy sauce

1 cup sugar

1/2 cup Shaoxing wine

1/4 cup honey

6 garlic cloves, minced

2 inches of ginger, peeled and minced

2 tsp roasted black sesame seeds

1 small bunch of scallions

2-3 pieces of star anise

1 tsp five-spice powder

1/2 tsp ground white pepper

1 Tbsp cornstarch

2 Tbsp water

1 package of Tower of Fantasy Tof

Instructions

1. Marinate the suckling pig

Start by cleaning the suckling pig thoroughly and trimming off any excess fat. Make sure to remove any organs from inside the pig as well. Combine the soy sauce, sugar, Shaoxing wine, honey, garlic, ginger, sesame seeds, scallions, star anise, five-spice powder, and white pepper in a large bowl. Mix well to combine all the ingredients.

2. Prepare the pig

Place the cleaned pig into a large plastic bag and pour the marinade over the pig, making sure to coat it well on all sides. Seal the bag and marinate the pig in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours. Turn the pig occasionally to ensure even marinating.

3. Roast the pig

Preheat the oven to 375°F. Remove the pig from the marinade and place it in a roasting pan. Discard any remaining marinade. Roast the pig for approximately 3 hours, checking on it occasionally to make sure it is cooking evenly. If the skin begins to brown too quickly, cover it with foil.

4. Make the Tower of Fantasy Tof

While the pig is roasting, prepare the Tower of Fantasy Tof according to the package instructions. Set it aside.

5. Prepare the sauce

In a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch and water until smooth. Set aside. In a saucepan, bring the remaining marinade to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 5-10 minutes. Add the cornstarch mixture to the saucepan and stir constantly until the sauce thickens.

6. Assemble the dish

Once the pig is cooked and the Tower of Fantasy Tof is prepared, it's time to assemble the dish. Place the Tof in a tower shape on a large platter. Carefully place the roasted suckling pig on top of the Tof. Finally, pour the thickened sauce over the pig, making sure to coat it evenly.

Congratulations, you have now created a stunning and delicious roasted suckling pig in Tower of Fantasy Tof! This dish is sure to wow your guests and leave them wanting more.
