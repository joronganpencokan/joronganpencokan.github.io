Microsoft's newest operating system, Windows 11, has generated a lot of buzz since its launch in October 2021. However, one of the biggest concerns for PC users is whether their computers are compatible with this latest version or not. If you're someone who's interested in upgrading your OS or simply want to know if your PC can run Windows 11, this article is for you. Below are some tricks you can use to determine the compatibility of your computer with Windows 11.

**Trick #1: Use Microsoft's PC Health Check App**

Microsoft has made it easy for PC users to determine if their device is compatible with Windows 11 by releasing a free, downloadable app called PC Health Check. This app scans your computer's hardware and provides a report on whether your device can run Windows 11 or not. The app will check things like your processor, RAM, storage, display, and security features, and give you a clear indication if your computer meets Microsoft's minimum requirements.

To use the PC Health Check app, simply go to the Microsoft website and download the app. Once installed, click on "Start," and the app will automatically scan your computer. The tool will let you know if your machine meets the minimum requirements for Windows 11 or not.

**Trick #2: Check Your Device's Processor Compatibility**

One of the main requirements for Windows 11 is that your device must have a compatible processor. Specifically, your processor must have a 64-bit architecture and a minimum of two cores with a clock speed of 1 GHz or more. Additionally, it must support a feature called Secure Boot, which helps to protect your PC from malware and other threats.

To find out if your processor is compatible with Windows 11, you can either check your device's specifications online or use a tool like CPU-Z. This free software provides detailed information on your computer's processor, including its clock speed, core count, and architecture.

**Trick #3: Determine If Your Device Meets the Memory and Storage Requirements**

Aside from the processor, another vital component to consider when checking if your PC is compatible with Windows 11 is its memory and storage. Windows 11 requires at least 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage space to install. However, Microsoft recommends having 8 GB of RAM and an SSD instead of traditional hard drives to run the OS optimally.

To check your device's memory and storage, simply open the "Properties" window of your computer and click on "Device Manager." From there, you can check the system memory and storage space.

In conclusion, determining if your PC is compatible with Windows 11 is crucial if you're planning to upgrade or switch to Microsoft's latest OS. By using the tricks mentioned above, you can quickly and easily check whether your computer can run Windows 11 or not. If you find that your device does not meet the minimum requirements, consider upgrading certain components or investing in a new PC that can run the latest OS without a hitch.

You can now use the WhyNotWin11 tool to know the exact reason why Windows 11 cannot run on your computer. While Microsoft is making Windows 11 a free upgrade for existing Windows 10 devices, the minimum hardware requirements have been significantly increased, which means that many computers won’t be able to run the new OS.
 
Microsoft made available the “PC Health Check” app. However, it’s been more confusing than helpful since it does not provide enough information to determine why your computer may or may not be compatible with Windows 11, and that’s when the WhyNotWin11 tool comes in handy.
 
WhyNotWin11 is a third-party tool developed by Robert C. Maehl (via XDA-Developers) available through GitHub that checks and lets you know exactly what components may block the Windows 11 installation, including information about the processor and whether or not your device features a TPM 2.0 chip.
 
In this guide, you will learn the steps to use the WhyNotWin11 tool to know exactly why your PC won’t run Windows 11.
 
## Check why your PC can’t run Windows 11
 
To know exactly why your PC cannot run Windows 11, use these steps:
 
- Open the WhyNotWin11 GitHub page.
 - Click the Download here button to save the tool on your device.
 - WhyNotWin11 download
 - Quick note: If the browser blocks the download, you will need to force it to keep the file.
 - Right-click the WhyNotWin11.exe file and select the Run as administrator option.
 - Click the More info link in the warning and click the Run anyway button.
 - Confirm the reason why Windows 11 can’t run on your PC.
 - Windows 11 compatibility check

 
Once you complete the steps, the tool will run automatically and clearly let you know whether the processor, memory, storage, and other requirements like Secure Boot, TPM, and DirectX are compatible with Windows 11.
 
Open the WhyNotWin11 GitHub page.
 
Click the Download here button to save the tool on your device.
 
Right-click the WhyNotWin11.exe file and select the Run as administrator option.
 
Click the More info link in the warning and click the Run anyway button.
 
Confirm the reason why Windows 11 can’t run on your PC.
 
Windows 11 compatibility check

 
The components that are not supported that will prevent you from upgrading to the new version of the OS will be marked in red. The hardware that won’t block the installation will be marked in green. And you may also see components, such as the processor, with a yellow mark, which indicates that the hardware is not in the compatibility list, but you may still be able to proceed with the install.
