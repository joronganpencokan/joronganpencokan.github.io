Well, it's true! With this simple yet effective method, you'll be able to copy folders in a matter of seconds, saving you time and hassle. So, without further ado, let's dive into the secret hack for copying Google Drive folders like a pro!

## Step 1: "Add to My Drive"

The first step in mastering this secret hack is to "Add to My Drive" the folder you want to copy. This step is crucial because it makes the folder accessible from your Drive's root directory, which is required for the next step. 

To add the folder to your Drive, follow these easy steps:

1. Right-click on the folder you want to copy.
2. Select "Add to My Drive" from the drop-down menu.

## Step 2: "Make a Copy"

Now that the folder has been added to your Drive, it's time to make a copy. This is where the secret hack comes in handy. Instead of manually copying the folder, you can use the "Make a Copy" option to instantly create a new copy.

Here's how to do it:

1. Navigate to the folder you just added to your Drive.
2. Right-click on the folder and select "Make a Copy" from the drop-down menu.
3. Give the new copy a name and select the location where you want it to be saved.

And that's it! You now have an exact copy of the original folder, saved in the location of your choosing. 

## Bonus Tip: "Rename and Organize"

Now that you've made a copy of the folder, you may want to rename it or organize it within your Drive. This is a great opportunity to keep your Drive files and folders tidy and easy to navigate.

To rename the copied folder, simply right-click on it and select "Rename" from the drop-down menu. You can give it a new name that reflects its purpose or content, making it easier to find in the future.

To organize the copied folder, drag and drop it into a new location within your Drive. You may want to create a new folder or move it into an existing one, depending on your organizational needs. This will help you keep your Drive files and folders more organized and accessible, reducing the time you spend searching for specific files.

## Final Thoughts

Copying folders in Google Drive doesn't have to be a tedious process. By mastering this secret hack, you can copy folders like a pro and save time and hassle in the process. Remember to "Add to My Drive" the folder you want to copy and use the "Make a Copy" option to instantly create a new copy. And don't forget to rename and organize your copied folders for added convenience and accessibility.

##   Can You Make a Copy of an Entire Folder in Google Drive?  
 

You can't copy an entire folder in Google Drive in just a single click. However, there are two methods you can use to copy a folder and all files into another new folder.

 
###   Copy an Entire Folder in Google Drive  
 

You can create a copy of the folder contents and move those copies to a new folder.

 
There is no option to copy an entire folder in Google Drive using the Drive mobile app either. So you'll have to use one of the options below whether you're using the browser or the mobile app.
