Imagine living in a world where you can't see. You can't read signs or books, recognize faces, or even navigate on your own. What if I told you that Google's cutting-edge technology has brought a revolution for the visually impaired? The Google Glass, commonly known as just Glass, has made life a bit easier and more convenient for visually impaired people. You won't believe what Google Glass just did for them! So, let's dive in and explore the marvel of technology that is the Google Glass for the visually impaired.

Google Glass: A Brief Overview
Google Glass is a wearable computer with an optical head-mounted display that works as a hands-free smartphone while the wearer can still interact with the physical world. Its display appears just above the right eye, and the user interacts with it through voice commands, touch gestures, or head movements.
Initially, Google Glass was designed as an experimental product to enhance everyday life, bringing the internet into everyday life. However, its limitations and basic features made it less of a sought after product. Later, Google realized that it could be more beneficial for people with disabilities.

How Google Glass Assists The Visually Impaired
The Google Glass technology works with a plethora of applications that aim to help the visually impaired get over their everyday tasks with more ease. The applications focus on tasks such as reading, object recognition, map and location, and even facial recognition.

Applications For Reading
The perfect application for reading is the ever so famous BraillEyeGlass. This app uses OCR technology to translate texts into Braille and displays it on the Glass's screen. As the user swipes their finger on the touchpad, the Glass scans the text, analyzes it, and displays it into readable Braille.

Applications for Object Recognition
The Visor App is the perfect partner to aid a visually impaired person with object recognition. The app uses camera captures and translates the images into an audible output through the Glass's speaker. For instance, if you are holding up a can of soda or a carton of milk, the app would tell you what it is.

Applications for Location and Navigation
The GPS apps such as the MoveEye and NavCog provide directions, recognize toll booths, pedestrian crossings and build layouts, and even voice guides you through the map.

Applications for Facial Recognition
Facial recognition apps such as the NameTag identifies and recognizes the person in front of the Glass wearer. It uses augmented reality technology backed by social media profiles to provide instant recognition, providing practical help to the visually impaired when they come across an acquaintance or even a stranger.

Conclusion
Using Google Glass for visually impaired people has revolutionized the way they navigate and explore their daily lives. The applications are a boon to help people with visual impairments interact and engage with the world much more efficiently, providing practical and timely assistance. With Google Glass and rising technology, solutions for people with disabilities are becoming more prominent than ever, and it is undoubtedly a step in the right direction.

Reports are in that Google, as a part of its Glass Project, is developing technology that will enable blind people to see through a sight to sound translation mechanism.  The concept in use here is that of Sound Navigation and Ranging or sonar- which is used by submarines and also marine animals like dolphins for determining positions of target objects. Let’s see how this works:
 
 
 
Active sonar creates a pulse of sound or ping, which is directed towards the target and then listens for the reflection or echo of the pulse. This pulse is electronically generated using a sonar projector which consists of power amp, signal generator and electro acoustic transducer. The distance of the target object is measured by calculating the time from pulse transmission to reception which is converted into a range by finding out the speed of sound.
 
The Google Glass already has a camera to see the target object and headphones to hear sounds but it still needs a hardware system to transmit the pulse to the target object and receive the echo or sound reflected from the target.  Thus, we can expect some sound to sight translator device that connects with Google glass.
 
The tech community is eagerly waiting to see how this project will turn out.  The anticipation is not just because of the level of sophistication that is embedded in the project but also because it intends to give the visually impaired a chance to see. We can imagine how this revolutionary technology will change the lives of millions of people.
