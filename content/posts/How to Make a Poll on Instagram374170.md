# Unlock the Power of Instagram: Learn How to Create a Viral Poll in Just Minutes!

Instagram is a platform that never fails to amaze its users with new features and updates. The Instagram poll feature is one such tool that has gained popularity in recent years. Instagram Polls allow you to engage with your followers in a unique way, creating opportunities for valuable interactions with your followers.

With Instagram's massive audience, creating a hit viral poll can help you achieve a great deal of reach, engagement, and follower growth. Follow these tips to create a poll that will attract the attention of the masses in just a few minutes:

**Pick a relevant topic**

The first step is to choose a suitable topic that aligns with your niche and interests your target audience. Try to think of questions that resonate with your audience, and don't hesitate to take inspiration from current events or popular trends.

**Create an eye-catching image or video**

Instagram polls are visual components, so it is essential to make sure your poll graphics are visually appealing. You can add a vibrant background or use an image that relates to the poll question. Instagram also offers a range of interactive stickers that can be placed on photos and videos to make your polls more engaging and attractive.

**Make it personal**

Personalization is key to connecting with your followers, and polls are a great way to do that. Try to incorporate elements that make the poll personal or relatable to your audience. For example, you may include questions about their preferences or their thoughts on a decision you are trying to make.

**Keep-it-simple**

Lengthy polls are not ideal, strive to keep your poll questions short, simple, and to the point. Your followers will lose interest if the poll questions are complicated or confusing, so try your best to simplify the questions and provide clear directions.

**Encourage engagement**

Finally, encourage your followers to engage with your polls. You can do this by responding to every comment, taking note of feedback, and involving them in the decision-making process. You can also repost screenshots of the results to showcase participation and engage with people who didn't have a chance to participate.

In conclusion, if you want to boost your Instagram audience and engagement, then a viral poll can be your answer. A well-planned and well-executed Instagram poll can achieve wonders on your Instagram account, from boosting your engagement rate to increasing your followers. By implementing these tips and experimenting with different styles, you can unlock the power of Instagram polls and set yourself up for success.

##   Make a Poll in Instagram Stories  
 

Instagram stories are casual photos or short videos that share what you're doing at the moment with your followers. When you post a new story, it appears in your followers' home tabs as a bubble at the top of the feed and disappears automatically after 24 hours.

 
Since full functionality for the stories and direct messaging features can only be used on the official Instagram mobile app, you can only create Instagram polls on the app and not in a web browser at Instagram.com.
 
- Open the Instagram app on your iOS or Android device, and if necessary, sign in to your account or switch to the account you want to use.

 - To customize your two poll answers, select the Yes button and type your desired answer in the field. Do the same with the No button.
 - When you're happy with your poll, select Done in the upper-right corner.
