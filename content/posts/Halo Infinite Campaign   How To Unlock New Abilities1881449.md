The latest Title of Halo, Halo Infinite had finally released its Campaign Mode in December of 2021. Halo Infinite is set in the Hostile world of Zeta Halo. The main premise of the game is you play as the Master Chief who was saved by a UNSC Soldier and now is tasked to liberate Zeta Halo from the Banished. To complete the liberation, you will need some good abilities. In this guide, I will explain how to unlock the new Abilities in Halo Infinite.
 
## How to unlock new Abilities in Halo Infinite
 

 
In Halo Infinite Campaign, you get a total of 5 Abilities. Those 5 Abilities are Grappleshot, Threat Sensor, Thrusters, Drop Wall, and Shield Core. Well, there is a good side and a bad side on how you can unlock the Abilities, mostly a good side. At the start of the game, you have access to Grappleshot. So traversing through the map will become fairly easy. The other 4 Abilities in Halo Infinite will be locked until you find them as you progress through the game. Do not worry as these Abilities are important for your progression and are integrated into the Main Storyline. Although you can miss their upgrades if you don’t explore the map enough.
 
### All Abilities in the game
 
Grappleshot is a movement-based Ability in Halo Infinite where you shot a hook and pull yourself to that anchor point. It is very useful for traversing and dodging enemies. Threat Sensor is your Information gathering Ability. It shoots out a Recon Dart that will detect any enemy within its radius of effect. This works with invisible enemies as well. Thrusters are your other movement ability but it is faster than Grappleshot but not as effective. It is like a dash or a quick get-out-danger Ability in Halo Infinite.
 
Drop Wall is an Ability that puts up a one-way wall. You will be able to block damage and deal damage to your enemies simultaneously. Be careful as it doesn’t have that much health. Finally, we have the Shield Core. This Ability increases the amount of Shields your Character will get. The more you upgrade it, the more Shields you will get.
