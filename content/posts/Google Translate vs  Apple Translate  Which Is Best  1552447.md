Translation Showdown: The Epic Battle between Google and Apple Translate - Find Out Who Comes Out on Top!

The world is becoming more connected every day, and languages are no longer barriers to communication. With the help of translation software/devices/apps, we can easily communicate across different languages. In the battle of the titans of the translation world, we have Google Translate and Apple Translate. In this article, we will outline the features, similarities, and differences between the two and find out who comes out on top.

Features of Google Translate

Google Translate, developed by Google LLC, is a free web-based translation app. It supports translation in over 100 languages and can translate text, voice, and images. Google Translate provides several convenient features, such as text-to-speech, handwriting recognition, and offline mode. It also includes support for machine learning and real-time translation.

One of the most unique features of Google Translate is its ability to translate real-time speech. With the aid of machine learning, users can hold a conversation with someone who speaks another language, and Google Translate can interpret the conversation and provide translations in real-time. It also includes the option to save translations for future reference.

Features of Apple Translate

Apple Translate is a free translation app developed by Apple Inc. It is built into the iOS 14 operating system and supports 11 languages, including Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Arabic. Apple Translate offers text and voice translation and includes several convenient features such as split-screen mode, the ability to save recent translations, and an automatic language-detection feature that detects the language you’re attempting to translate.

One of the most fascinating features of Apple Translate is its integration with Siri, which allows users to ask for translations without necessarily launching the app first. The app is also available in a compact mode, which allows users to overlay the translated text on top of the original text.

Similarities between Google Translate and Apple Translate

Both Google Translate and Apple Translate offer impressive features and are intuitive to use. They both provide text and voice translations and support several languages. Both apps use machine learning to improve their accuracy and offer a one-tap conversation feature, which allows users to toggle between input and output languages.

Differences between Google Translate and Apple Translate

While both apps offer several similar features, there are still some differences between them. One of the most significant differences is the number of languages supported. Google Translate supports over 100 languages, while Apple Translate only supports 11 languages. Google Translate also offers an offline mode, which is a significant advantage when traveling or in areas without internet access.

Another significant difference between the two apps is the quality of translations. Google Translate provides a more accurate translation when dealing with complex or technical terms. Apple Translate is optimized for day-to-day usage and is the better option for casual conversation.

Conclusion

In conclusion, both Google Translate and Apple Translate are excellent translation apps that offer impressive features. While Google Translate has a more extensive language support and provides more accurate translations, Apple Translate is better suited for casual, everyday conversation. The two apps are perfect for different use cases, so it’s up to the user to choose which one fits their needs best.

As with most services, Google has long cornered the translation app market. However, after Apple launched its Apple Translate app with iOS 14, can the competing giant give Google Translate a run for its money? In this Google Translate vs. Apple Translate post, find out where the two translation apps diverge.
 
## User Interface (UI)
 
Both Google Translate and Apple Translate avoid icon clutter and mental load, aiming for an immediately readable and accessible design. Nonetheless, the Apple Translate app has a more accentuated space design. Its two buttons, each representing one side of the language translation, show right away which languages are selected. In contrast, Google Translate doesn’t have buttons and has a menu instead. It’s not a huge deal by any means but something to be improved upon.
 
When it comes to usability, Google beats Apple because it is easier to copy-paste the text in need of translation. This is an artifact of the iOS UI, where you have to keep holding and selecting the text. Again, it’s not a significant detraction, but Android users may need some time before they get over it.
 
Overall, Apple Translate is more pleasing to the eye, while Google Translate is overly utilitarian, as if the aesthetic design shouldn’t even be a part of the design equation.
 
## Translation Accuracy
 
You might have noticed that whenever you use Chrome’s translate page feature, it yields less than ideal results if the sentences are not simple. The same is true for both apps. It seems machine learning hates complex and compound sentences.
 
Therefore, if you use simple, low-word-count sentences, both Google Translate and Apple Translate will perform equally well. Of course, translation accuracy may differ from language to language, but one can assume they both have access to the same grammar rules and vocabularies.
 
Either way, it is impossible to notice any difference between the two when it comes to translation accuracy.
 
## Language Support
 
Unfortunately for Apple Translate, this category goes firmly in the Google camp. Apple supports only 11 languages as of the last official update on September 16, 2020. Those 11 supported languages for Apple Translate are Spanish, Italian, German, English, French, Arabic, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese.
 
In stark contrast, Google Translate supports over 100 languages, which for all intents and purposes accounts for most populations on the planet. However, out of those 100+, bilingual on-the-fly translation is only available for 43 languages, which is still four times higher than what Apple Translate offers.
 
When it comes to camera-assisted translation – image to text – Google Translate further limits it to 37 languages. Even lower than that, 32 are supported for audio translation. In the end, given that Apple Translate is not even a year old, such disparity in language support is to be expected.
 
## Translation Methods
 
Google Translate has six ways to translate languages:
 
- TypingTalkingViewing offline dictionary without Internet accessSpeakingHandwriting with a stylus, if supported by your smartphoneUsing the camera: either pointing the camera or snapping the text in view

 
Out of those features, Apple Translate only supports three: typing, speaking, and offline dictionary (built in). However, both apps can link with their respective ecosystems: Assistant for Google Translate and Siri for Apple Translate. Voice translation for both is efficient.
 
Lastly, both apps have a nifty phrasebook feature, where the most commonly translated phrases can be saved for later use.
 
## Monetization
 
Thankfully, both apps come free from ads or other forms of monetization. You can simply download them from their respective stores for free. You can find Google Translate here for Android and here for Apple iPhones.
 
## Conclusion
 
With Google Translate already available in the Apple App Store, it doesn’t make much sense to prioritize Apple Translate over it. The native Apple app is still missing a host of features and languages.
 
Nonetheless, if those that are supported are more than enough for your needs, Apple Translate does an equally solid translation job. On the other hand, if you want to go beyond mere apps and use a dedicated translator device, look no further than the Langogo Summit Language Translator.
