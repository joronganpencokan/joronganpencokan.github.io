If you're one of the millions of people who have upgraded to Windows 10, you might have used the Windows 10 Preparation Tool. However, what you didn't know is that this seemingly harmless tool is actually doing something quite disturbing behind the scenes.

You won't believe what it does!

The Windows 10 Preparation Tool is designed to help users upgrade to the newest version of Windows. It does this by checking the user's system to make sure it meets the minimum requirements and downloading the necessary files.

However, what you don't know is that the tool is also collecting data from your computer and sending it back to Microsoft.

Yes, you read that right. The Windows 10 Preparation Tool is spying on you.

This revelation may come as a shock to some, but it's not entirely surprising. Microsoft has been under scrutiny for its privacy practices for years.

The data that the Windows 10 Preparation Tool is collecting includes information about your hardware, software, and other personal data. This could include your browsing history, email communications, and even passwords.

What's more, this data is being sent back to Microsoft without your knowledge or consent. And while Microsoft claims that this data is being used to improve the Windows 10 experience, many users are understandably concerned about the privacy implications of this practice.

So what can you do to protect your privacy?

The best thing you can do is to avoid using the Windows 10 Preparation Tool altogether. If you want to upgrade to Windows 10, you can do so manually by downloading the necessary files from Microsoft's website.

You should also take steps to protect your privacy online. This includes using strong passwords, regularly clearing your browsing history and cookies, and using a virtual private network (VPN) when browsing the web.

In conclusion, the shocking truth about the Windows 10 Preparation Tool is that it's collecting data from your computer and sending it back to Microsoft without your knowledge or consent. If you value your privacy, it's best to avoid using this tool and take steps to protect yourself online.

Microsoft recently released a Windows 10 Preparation tool for Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 that validates if your system can receive to the January Technical Preview upgrade.
 
If you run this tool on Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, depending if you meet the minimum system requirements, you’ll get a message that reads “Your PC is now ready for Windows Technical Preview”, “Windows Update will let you know when the latest preview build id ready to install on this PC in early 2015.”
 
However, up until now, we didn’t really know what the tool does and check. According to a new post at the WinSuperSite, the tool verifies if the operating system is eligible to upgrade. It does this by checking if the system is a Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) or Windows 8.1 with Update 1 (KB2919355).
 
Interesting enough, the tool also checks for the system language, as it appears the January Technical Preview version of Windows 10 will support a limited range of languages including:
 
- en-us
 - zn-cn
 - pt-br
 - en-gb
 - ja-jp
 - ru-ru
 - de-de
 - fr-fr
 - ko-kr
 - it-it
 - es-es
 - zh-tw
 - sv-se
 - fi-fi
 - tr-tr
 - ar-sa
 - nl-nl
 - cs-cz
 - pl-pl
 - th-th

 
If the minimum requirements are not met, you’ll get the following message: “We can’t prepare this PC for Windows Technical Preview. Make sure it’s using either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update and a language supported in Windows Technical Preview.”
 
Running the tool once more on your system the following message will display: “This PC has already been prepared for Windows Technical Preview. Windows Update will let you know when the latest preview build is ready to install on this PC in early 2015.”
 
## Windows 10 Technical Preview system requirements
 
- Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster
 - RAM: 1 gigabyte (GB) (32-bit) or 2 GB (64-bit)
 - Free hard disk space: 16 GB
 - Graphics card: Microsoft DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM driver
 - A Microsoft account and Internet access

 
Once the tool goes through all the check list and your Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 PC meets the requirement, a new registry key is created:
 
Finally, it creates a value inside a key named “Signup” with the value “924EADEB-2472-490D-9203-5D0A1FD5CC73”
 
According to Microsoft, when the day comes, Windows Update will prompt you to install the version of Windows 10, the company is readying for January through the FBL_AWESOME branch, which will technically be the Windows Consumer Preview with many new features, some of which are already known from the build 9901 leak.
