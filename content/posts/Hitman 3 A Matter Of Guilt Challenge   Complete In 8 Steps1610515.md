Title: Unlock the Ultimate Hitman 3 Challenge: Can You Solve the 'A Matter of Guilt' Mission in Just 8 Steps?

If you are a fan of stealth action games, then you must have heard of the critically acclaimed Hitman series. The latest release - Hitman 3 - has garnered widespread praise for its intricate levels, immersive gameplay, and thrilling narrative. One of the most challenging missions in the game is 'A Matter of Guilt,' which tasks players with taking down a corporate tycoon amid a flurry of guards, traps, and obstacles. Can you beat this mission in just eight steps? Let's find out.

Step 1: Access the Wine Cellar 

The mission begins in the vineyard, where you must infiltrate the main building and access the wine cellar. The easiest way to do this is by sneaking around the side entrance and disabling the guard in front of the keycard reader. You can also distract him with a thrown object or a coin.

Step 2: Disguise Yourself as the Waiter 

Once you have the keycard, head to the wine cellar and grab the waiter outfit from the laundry room. You can distract the patrolling guard inside the laundry by throwing something, or hiding in the locker until he leaves. Make sure to dump the body in a container to avoid suspicion.

Step 3: Poison the Wine Glass 

Now, make your way to the main hall, where the target is mingling with guests. Keep a low profile and blend in with the other waiters. When the target takes a sip of his wine, he will get sick and head to the bathroom. Follow him and subdue him in one of the stalls.

Step 4: Take the Security Card 

With the target incapacitated, search his belongings for the security card that leads to his private office. You can also take a photo of the documents on his phone to complete a side objective. Be careful not to arouse suspicion from other guests or guards.

Step 5: Retrieve the USB Stick 

The private office is located on the top floor of the building and is heavily guarded. Disguise yourself as a guard or use stealth to avoid detection. Once inside, use the security card to access the safe and retrieve the USB stick containing sensitive data.

Step 6: Plant the Tracker 

Before leaving the office, plant a tracker device inside the ivory white briefcase on the table. This will help you pinpoint the location of the target's secret hideout. Make sure to leave unnoticed and avoid any confrontations.

Step 7: Follow the Trail 

The tracker will lead you to a secret underground laboratory hidden beneath the vineyard. Here, the target is conducting illegal experiments on human subjects. Sneak past the guards and use your skills to disable the security measures.

Step 8: Take Down the Target 

Finally, reach the target's chamber and confront him. You can use the environment to your advantage, such as gas pipes or exposed electrical wires, to create distractions or take out the guards. Once the target is alone, use a quick takedown or a silenced gun to finish the job. Mission Complete.

Conclusion

The 'A Matter of Guilt' mission in Hitman 3 is a complex and challenging task that requires a blend of stealth, strategy, and cunning. By following these eight steps, you can complete the mission in a relatively short time and earn a spot as an elite assassin. Are you up for the challenge? Put your skills to the test and see if you can beat the ultimate Hitman 3 mission.
