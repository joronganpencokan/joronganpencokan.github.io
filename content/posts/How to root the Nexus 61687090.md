If you own a Nexus 6, chances are that you already know how powerful and capable it can be. With its high-end specs and Google's commitment to timely software updates, this device was a favorite among Android enthusiasts when it was released in 2014.

However, even the Nexus 6 has its limitations, and there's only so much you can do with a device that's running stock Android. That's where rooting comes in - by gaining root access, you can unlock a whole new world of customization and functionality. In this article, we'll show you how to root your Nexus 6 with a few simple steps.

Before we begin, it's important to understand what rooting is and why you might want to do it. Rooting essentially means gaining administrator-level access to your device, which allows you to do things that are normally restricted by the manufacturer or carrier. For example, you can install custom ROMs, remove pre-installed bloatware, and tweak system settings to improve performance and battery life.

Of course, rooting also comes with some risks. If you're not careful, you could potentially brick your device or compromise its security. That's why it's crucial to follow the instructions carefully and only download files from trusted sources.

With that said, let's get started with the rooting process:

**Step 1: Backup your data**

Before you begin, it's important to back up all your data to a safe location. This includes your contacts, messages, photos, and any important files. There's a chance that something could go wrong during the rooting process, so it's better to be safe than sorry.

**Step 2: Enable USB Debugging**

Next, you'll need to enable USB debugging on your Nexus 6. This allows your computer to communicate with your device and transfer files. To do this, go to Settings > Developer options, then toggle on the USB debugging option.

**Step 3: Download and install the necessary software**

You'll need a few tools to root your Nexus 6, including:

- ADB and Fastboot drivers (can be downloaded as part of the Android SDK)
- TWRP custom recovery
- SuperSU zip file (this is the actual rooting tool)

You can download all these files from trusted sources online. Once you have them, extract the ADB and Fastboot drivers to a folder on your computer.

**Step 4: Connect your Nexus 6 to your computer**

Connect your Nexus 6 to your computer via USB cable. Make sure USB debugging is still enabled, and that your device is in MTP mode (to enable file transfer). Open the folder where you extracted the ADB and Fastboot drivers, then right-click on "Command Prompt" and choose "Run as administrator".

**Step 5: Boot into Recovery mode**

To flash the SuperSU zip file, you'll need to boot into TWRP recovery. You can do this by holding down the Power button and Volume Down button simultaneously until the Nexus logo appears, then releasing them and pressing the Volume Down button again until you see the TWRP logo.

**Step 6: Flash the SuperSU zip**

In TWRP recovery, select "Install", then navigate to the folder where you saved the SuperSU zip file. Select the file and swipe to confirm the installation. This will install the SuperSU app on your device, which gives you root access.

**Step 7: Reboot and enjoy**

Once the installation is complete, you can reboot your device and enjoy your newly rooted Nexus 6! You can now install custom ROMs, change system settings, and do all sorts of fun stuff that wasn't possible before.

In conclusion, rooting your Nexus 6 can open up a whole new world of possibilities. While it does come with some risks, if you follow the instructions carefully and use trusted sources, you shouldn't encounter any major issues. Give it a try and see how much more you can get out of your device!

Just like Nexus devices before it, the Motorola made Nexus 6 is very developer and hacker friendly. Gaining root access on the device is as simple as it was on the previous generation Nexus devices, which when coupled with its open-source nature, instantly makes it a very popular device in the community.
The positive side of all this love is that the Nexus 6 has a plethora of kernels, custom ROMs and other mods available for it that greatly enhances its features, boosts its battery life and more.
If you are looking to root your Nexus 6, you can follow the steps below. However, do note that once you have rooted the device, you will not receive any future OTA updates from Google and will have to manually install the updates.
Step 1: The first thing you need to do to gain root access on your Nexus 6 is to unlock its bootloader. This will wipe the internal storage of the device, so it is recommended that you create a backup first. You can find the steps to unlock the bootloader of the Nexus 6 here.
Step 2: Gaining root access requires you to install a custom recovery on the device first followed by flashing the SuperSU binary through it. Download the recovery image file for the Nexus 6 and the SuperSU ZIP file from below.

SuperSU ZIP File



Rename the TWRP image file to “nexus6recovery” and transfer it inside the folder containing the ADB/Fastboot files that you had created while unlocking the bootloader. Also, transfer the SuperSU ZIP file to the internal storage of your device.
Step 3: Reboot your Nexus 6 into Fastboot mode by pressing switching it off, and then holding down the Volume Down + Power key for a couple of seconds.
Step 4: On your PC, open a new Terminal or Command Prompt window and navigate to the “nexus6” folder — which contains the recovery image and the ADB/Fastboot files — on your desktop. Use the ‘cd’ command to achieve this. In most cases copy-pasting the below command will work for the majority of users.
Step 5: Connect the phone to your PC, and run the command mentioned below to make sure that the handset is being detected properly.
Mac owners — make sure to prefix a “./” before every fastboot or ADB command you run. So the above command will look something like this on your PC:
Step 6: Once detected, its now time to flash the TWRP recovery on your Nexus 6.
Step 7: The flashing process will take only a few seconds. When done, use the volume keys on your Nexus 6 to navigate to the ‘Recovery’ option and confirm your selection by pressing the Power key.

Step 8: Your Nexus 6 will then reboot into TWRP recovery. Select the ‘Install’ option and then proceed to select the SuperSU ZIP file.
Step 9: Once the file is flashed, select the ‘Reboot System’ to boot back into Android. If the SuperSU app is now present in your app drawer, you have successfully managed to gain root access on your Nexus 6.
