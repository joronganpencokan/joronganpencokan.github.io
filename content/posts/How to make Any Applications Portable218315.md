Are you tired of being tied to one computer or device for your app needs? Do you wish you could take your apps with you wherever you go? Look no further, because we have the solution for you - a portable app hack!

With this hack, you can create a portable version of your favorite apps and programs that you can use on any computer or device with a USB port. This means you can work on your projects, play games, and use your favorite tools wherever you are, without the need for installation or configuration.

The key to this hack is a portable app creator tool, such as PortableApps.com or Cameyo. These tools allow you to create a portable version of almost any software program by packaging it into a single, self-contained executable file that can be run from a USB drive or any other portable storage device.

To create a portable app, simply download and install the portable app creator tool of your choice, then start the tool and follow the on-screen instructions to select the app or program you want to package. Once you have selected the app, the tool will create a portable version of it that you can save to your USB drive or other portable storage device.

One of the biggest advantages of this hack is the flexibility it offers. If you are using a computer that does not allow you to install software or if you are working on a public computer, you can simply plug in your USB drive and run your portable app. This means you can avoid any potential security risks associated with installing unknown software on a public computer.

Another advantage is the ability to use your apps on multiple devices without the need for installation or configuration. If you use different computers or devices for work and personal use, you can simply take your USB drive with you and use your apps on any of these devices.

The only downside to this hack is that the portable app may not have access to system resources or settings that the installed version would normally have. For example, if a program requires administrative privileges to run or if it needs to access files stored in specific system directories, it may not function properly in a portable version.

Despite this limitation, the portable app hack is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to take their apps with them wherever they go. Whether you need to work remotely, travel frequently, or just want the flexibility to use your apps on multiple devices, this hack is sure to unlock new possibilities for you. So why not give it a try and see how it can improve your productivity and portability?

Portable applications are useful in that you can run it in any computers and without installation. The bad thing is, not every applications can be made portable. One of the solutions that we reviewed previously is to make your Windows XP portable so you can carry all your apps around. However, that can be an overkill for many. Most of the time, we just need access to a few applications, not the whole OS. This is where Cameyo comes in to fill the gap.
 
Cameyo is a Windows only software that virtualize your applications into a single exe file. With this virtualize application, you can bring it around and use it in any computers, without installation.

 
### Usage
 
Download and install Cameyo
 
Run Cameyo. Click “Capture installation”.
 

 
It will first take a snapshot before the installation.
 
When the Proceed with installation message appear, proceed with your application installation. 
 
In this example, we will install the Opera browser in our Windows system.
 
When the installation is completed, simply click the “Install done” button.
 
Cameyo would then proceed to take a post installation snapshot to determine the files/folders that have changed. This could take some time. It is best to leave your system alone during this process
 
Once it is done with the snapshot, it will prompt you to enter the identification detail.
 
Lastly, it will package the executable into a virtual file.
 
You should now see a folder in your desktop. Inside the folder should contain the executable file of the application that you have just installed.
 
Now, you can copy this folder to your thumb drive, bring it around with you and access to your applications wherever you are.
 
### Conclusion
 
Personally, I have not test every single application in my system, so there is no way to know if Cameyo works for all. I have tested Opera, Safari browser and Filezilla. The post-installation snapshot of Safari took far too long, so I cancelled it before it was completed. As for Opera and Filezilla, they work fine.
 
Test it out and let us know which applications work and which one don’t.
