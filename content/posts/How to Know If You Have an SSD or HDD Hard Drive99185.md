Have you ever noticed your computer running slower than usual? This can be frustrating, especially when you have tasks to complete that require a fast and efficient computer. However, before you consider purchasing a new computer, you may want to check whether your computer has a Solid State Drive (SSD) or a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) hard drive.

SSD and HDD hard drives are two types of storage devices used in computers. While both serve the same purpose of storing data on your computer, they differ in terms of speed, reliability, and durability. 

HDDs are the older and more traditional type of hard drive. They consist of spinning disks that read and write data with a mechanical arm. Due to the mechanical nature of HDDs, they are slower than SSDs in terms of read and write speeds, making them less efficient for tasks that require fast data transfer speeds. 

On the other hand, SSDs are a newer type of hard drive that uses NAND-based flash memory to store data. Unlike HDDs, SSDs have no moving parts, which makes them faster and more reliable. SSDs can access data almost instantly, which makes them ideal for tasks that require fast performance or quick data transfer rates, such as booting up the computer, launching applications, or opening large files.

So, how do you check whether you have an SSD or HDD hard drive? Follow these simple steps:

Step 1: Click on the "Start" button and then click on "Computer" or "This PC" depending on your version of Windows.

Step 2: Look for the hard drive icon(s) listed, usually labeled as "Local Disk (C:)" or "Local Disk (D:)". Right-click on the hard drive icon you want to check and select "Properties".

Step 3: In the General tab, look for the information on the "File system" and "Free space" fields. If the file system is listed as NTFS and the free space is more than 50%, then you most likely have an HDD. If the file system is listed as NTFS and the free space is less than 50%, then you may have either an HDD or an SSD. However, if the file system is listed as NTFS or exFAT, and the free space is more than 90%, then you most likely have an SSD.

In conclusion, knowing whether you have an SSD or HDD hard drive can make a significant difference in the performance of your computer. If you have an HDD, you may want to consider upgrading to an SSD to improve the speed and efficiency of your computer. By following the simple steps above, you can easily determine what type of hard drive you have and take the appropriate next steps to optimize your computer's performance.

##   How Do I Know If I Have SSD or HDD Windows 10?  
 

If you need to know whether your Windows 10 PC has a SSD or HDD for storage, there are a few different ways of finding out. Here's the quickest solution in Windows 10 to find out if your storage is SDD- or HDD-based.

 
The instructions in this article apply to computers running the Windows 10 operating system.
 
- On your Windows 10 PC, press the Windows Key + S.
 - Alternatively, click the search bar on the taskbar.
 - Type defrag.
 - Click Defragment & Optimize Drives.
 - Check what's listed under Media type for your hard drive to determine if it's a SSD/solid-state drive or HDD/hard disk drive.

 
##   How Do I Find Out What Type of Hard Drive I Have?  
 

Another method to check what type of hard drive you have is to use the PowerShell or Command Prompt to find out. It's a little more involved but still fairly simple. Here's what to do.

 
There are some key differences between SSD and HDD storage that are worth consulting.
 

On your Windows 10 PC, press the Windows Key + S. 

 
Alternatively, click the search bar on the taskbar.
 

Type defrag.

 

Click Defragment & Optimize Drives.

 

Check what's listed under Media type for your hard drive to determine if it's a SSD/solid-state drive or HDD/hard disk drive.

 
- Press Windows Key + S or click the Search Bar on the Taskbar.
 - Type PowerShell.
 - Click Windows PowerShell.
 - Type Get-PhysicalDisk | Format-Table -AutoSize
 - Look under MediaType to see what kind of hard drive your PC is using.

 
##   How Do You Check Which SSD You Have?  
 

Another method to check your hard drive type is to use Device Manager. Here's where to look for it.

 

Press Windows Key + S or click the Search Bar on the Taskbar.

 

Type PowerShell.

 

Click Windows PowerShell.

 

Type Get-PhysicalDisk | Format-Table -AutoSize

 

Look under MediaType to see what kind of hard drive your PC is using.

 
- Press Windows Key + S or click the Search Bar on the Taskbar.
 - Type Device Manager.
 - Click Device Manager.
 - Double click Disk Drives.
 - View the hard drives listed below.

 
##   How Do I Know If I Have SSD or HDD on macOS?  
 

Checking what type of hard drive you have on macOS is different to Windows. Here's where to look.

 
This method is particularly useful if you need to know the storage drive involved.
 

Type Device Manager.

 

Click Device Manager.

 

Double click Disk Drives.

 

View the hard drives listed below.

 
- Click the Apple logo in the top left corner of the desktop.
 - Click About This Mac.
 - Click Storage.
 - Under the hard drive icon will be a description of the hard drive type such as Flash Storage which means it has an SSD installed.

 
##   What Difference Does My Hard Drive Type Make?  
 

It might seem like there's no difference between SSD or HDD but there are some fundamental things that make each stand out. Here's a quick look at them.

 
The vast majority of Macs use SSD drives unless your device is very old.
 

Click the Apple logo in the top left corner of the desktop.

 

Click About This Mac.

 

Click Storage.

 

Under the hard drive icon will be a description of the hard drive type such as Flash Storage which means it has an SSD installed.

 
- SSDs are faster. SSDs are a lot faster than conventional HDDs as they use a solid state drive method instead of spinning disks like a regular HDD. HDDs can last longer. It's only possible to write to a SSD a certain amount of times. That's a large number of times for the average user running into the tens of thousands but a conventional HDD can last even longer. Whichever you choose, it's far more likely that you'll upgrade the PC a long time before this becomes an issue.SSDs are smaller. Thanks to NVMe technology, SSDs are typically much, much smaller than HDDs which means they're well suited to increasingly small and lightweight laptops and other devices.

 
- How do I tell if my Chromebook has an HDD or SSD?
 - Chromebooks have SSDs for limited local file storage. For an update on the amount of local storage you have, select the App Launcher > My Files > More (three-dot icon) and find the amount of available space listed at the bottom of the drop-down menu. To view all your Chromebook specs, open the Chrome browser and type chrome://system.
 - How do I check that my HDD or SSD is healthy?
 - On Windows 10, use the Windows Error Checking Tool; right-click your disk > select Properties > Tools > Check > Scan drive. On macOS, check the Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) status; go to About this Mac > System Report > Storage > S.M.A.R.T. Status and look for Verified. You can also use a free hard drive testing program or tools provided by your HDD or SSD manufacturer to look for issues.
