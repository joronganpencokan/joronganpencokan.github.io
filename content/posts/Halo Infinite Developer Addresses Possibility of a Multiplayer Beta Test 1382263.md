There is no doubt that Halo Infinite is one of the most anticipated titles coming out this year, and although the campaign gameplay of the title was shown on the occasion of the Xbox Games Showcase, in the last few days some interesting details have emerged on the last effort of 343 Industries.
 
However, a developer of the American software house has recently addressed many of the concerns regarding Halo Infinite, including the possibility of releasing a beta version of the multiplayer mode.
 
During an interview with Halo Waypoint, John Junyszek, Community Manager of 343 Industries, said that due to the health emergency caused by COVID-19, the entire production process was slowed down. So, although the team is still working hard on the project, he does not rule out the possibility of offering its players a practical gaming experience, before the release of the project.
 
In that sense, the developer discusses the following whether there will be a multiplayer beta test:
 
In recent news, a retailer has listed in its database that the Halo Infinite’s multiplayer will be free-to-play and it will run at 120 FPS.
 
At this time we’re honestly not sure what is going to be possible in terms of flighting but we still hope to have an opportunity for broader public hands-on before release. And, as we’ve previously stated, we’ll be relying on flighting and continued feedback and community partnership well beyond launch as we grow and evolve the game together.
 
Recall that Halo Infinite will release during the Christmas holidays of 2020, even if no official release date has been announced at the moment, on Xbox Series X, PC, and Xbox One.
