Although Windows 11 22H2 is not due for several weeks, the feature update has already been finalized, which means you can install the new version before it becomes available to everyone on September 20.
 
If you want to upgrade early to the Windows 11 2022 Update, you have to enroll the computer in the Release Preview Channel to download and upgrade to the latest feature update through Windows Update. Or you can download the official ISO file (preview) to create a USB media to perform a clean installation.
 
This guide will teach you two ways to upgrade to Windows 11 22H2 right now before it becomes available to everyone.
 
- Install Windows 11 22H2 from Insider Program
 - Install Windows 11 22H2 using USB

 
## Install Windows 11 22H2 from Insider Program

The previews in this channel are stable, but you may still run into problems.
