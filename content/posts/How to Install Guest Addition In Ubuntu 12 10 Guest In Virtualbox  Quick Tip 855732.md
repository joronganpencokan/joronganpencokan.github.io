First, you must ensure that you have the VirtualBox Guest Additions ISO file. This file can be downloaded from the VirtualBox website or located in the installation directory on the host operating system.

Next, start up Ubuntu 12.10 in VirtualBox and click on "Devices" in the VirtualBox menu bar. Select "Insert Guest Additions CD Image." This will mount the ISO file to the virtual optical drive in Ubuntu 12.10.

In the Ubuntu 12.10 guest machine, open the terminal by pressing "Ctrl+Alt+T." Type in the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

After the dependencies have been installed, navigate to the VirtualBox Guest Additions directory by entering the following command:

[username] refers to your Ubuntu 12.10 username and [version] refers to the version of VirtualBox you are using.

Now, run the following command to start the installer:

sudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

The installation process may take a few minutes. Once completed, restart your Ubuntu 12.10 guest machine by entering the following command:

sudo reboot

Upon reboot, you should now be able to enjoy seamless integration between your Ubuntu 12.10 guest machine and host operating system. This includes features such as shared clipboard, shared folders, and automatic resizing of the guest display.

If you are trying out Ubuntu 12.10 in your Virtualbox and find that you are not able to install the guest additions, then you are not alone. I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 on several instances and on almost every instance, I am not able to install the guest additions. This is the message that I am getting:

(Look at /var/log/vboxadd-install.log to find out what went wrong)  
 
Looking at the vboxadd-install.log file, you will find that the cause for the installation failure is because of the missing kernel headers. This may sound complicated to you, but don’t worry, here’s the fix:
 
Open a terminal (in the Ubuntu VM) and type:
 
Once the installation is completed, you can proceed to install the guest additions. It should work this time. 
 
That’s it. Enjoy!
