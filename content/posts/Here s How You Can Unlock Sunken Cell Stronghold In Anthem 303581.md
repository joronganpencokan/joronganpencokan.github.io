You'll also want to take into account the types of enemies you'll be facing. Some enemies are resistant to fire, while others might be immune to certain types of status effects.

### 2. Keep Your Eyes Peeled for Switches

The Sunken Cell Stronghold is full of various puzzles that require you to activate switches to progress. Some switches might not be immediately obvious, so keep your eyes peeled for any switches that can be activated by a quick shot. Other switches require coordination with your team members to simultaneously activate them, so communication is key.

### 3. Fight Smart

One of the critical things to keep in mind when battling enemies in the Sunken Cell stronghold is to fight smart. Take note of enemy weaknesses and exploit them. Don't be afraid to use cover to avoid damage, and remember that teamwork is crucial in defeating some of the stronghold's more challenging enemies.

### 4. Use Your Ultimate Abilities Wisely

Your ultimate abilities can be the difference between victory and defeat in the Sunken Cell stronghold. Try to coordinate with your team members and use your ultimate abilities wisely. They can come in handy during boss battles or when you find yourself in a tight spot.

### 5. Stay Alert

Finally, it's essential to stay alert throughout the stronghold. Keep an eye out for enemies that might be lurking behind corners or spawning from unexpected locations. Make sure to communicate with your team members, and don't be afraid to fall back if you're overwhelmed.

## Conclusion

The Sunken Cell Stronghold is an exciting mission that provides a new level of challenge for Anthem players. With the right techniques and strategies, players can complete the stronghold with ease. Make sure to prepare your loadout, keep your eyes peeled for switches, fight smart, use your ultimate abilities wisely, and stay alert.
