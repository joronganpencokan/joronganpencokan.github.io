What is Wordle?

Making your own Wordle puzzle is a fun and easy way to get creative, and it's a great activity that you can do with your friends and family. Here's how you can create your very own Wordle puzzle:

Step 1: Choose Your Mystery Word

The first step is to choose a mystery word. This can be any word that you want, but it should be a word that is relatively easy to guess with a few clues. Once you have chosen your mystery word, write it down on a piece of paper.

Step 2: Generate a Random Set of Letters

The next step is to generate a random set of letters for your Wordle puzzle. You can do this by using an online random letter generator, or you can do it manually by choosing letters at random from a hat or jar.
