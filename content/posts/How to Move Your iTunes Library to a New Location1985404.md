Stop The Stress! Learn The Easy Trick To Move Your iTunes Library To A New Location!

If you are an iTunes user, then at some point, you must have faced the issue of running out of space on your computer or wanting to move your library to a more convenient location. But the thought of moving your entire library can leave you feeling stressed out and overwhelmed. However, there is an easy trick that you can use to move your iTunes library to a new location without any hassle.

Before we start, it's important to take a backup of your iTunes library to avoid loss of data. Once you've done that, follow the steps below to move your iTunes library to a new location:

Step 1: Choose the new location for your iTunes library

The first step is to choose a new location where you want to move your iTunes library. This could be an external hard drive, a network server or any other location that suits your needs. Once you've selected the location, make sure it has enough free space to accommodate your entire library.

Step 2: Copy your iTunes library to the new location

Next, you need to copy your entire iTunes library to the new location. To do this, locate the iTunes folder on your computer. By default, this folder should be located in the Music folder on a Mac and in the My Music folder on a PC.

To copy the iTunes folder, simply drag and drop it to the new location that you've selected. You can also use the Copy and Paste function to move the folder. Once the copying is complete, check to make sure that all your media files and playlists have been transferred.

Step 3: Tell iTunes where your library is now located

After you've copied your library to the new location, it's time to tell iTunes where to find it. To do this, hold down the Option key (Mac) or the Shift key (PC) while opening iTunes. A message will appear asking you to choose the iTunes library that you want to use. Click on the "Choose Library" button and select the new location where you've copied your iTunes library.

After selecting the new location, iTunes will restart and you'll see your entire library as it was before. However, now all your media files and playlists will be stored at the new location.

By following these three easy steps, you can move your entire iTunes library to a new location without any stress. This trick can not only free up space on your computer, but also make it easier to access your media files from anywhere. So, the next time you want to move your iTunes library, you'll have a stress-free solution at your fingertips.

 - On older versions of iTunes, select the Advanced tab.
 - Make sure the Keep Music Media folder organized option is enabled. If it's already checked, skip to the next step.
