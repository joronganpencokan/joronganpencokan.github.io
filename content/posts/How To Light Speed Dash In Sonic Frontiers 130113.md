# Unleash Sonic's Ultimate Technique: Learn How To Light Speed Dash in Sonic Frontiers NOW!

Sonic the Hedgehog is one of the most iconic video game characters of all time. He has been captivating gamers for over two decades with his incredible speed, adventurous spirit, and dynamic skills. But the one skill that truly sets him apart from any other video game character is his famous Light Speed Dash. This incredible technique allows Sonic to race through levels at lightning speed, covering vast distances in mere seconds, and gathering the precious rings that are scattered throughout the game.

In the upcoming game Sonic Frontiers, Sonic's Light Speed Dash is more impressive than ever, and in this article, we'll teach you how to master this incredible technique.

## What is a Light Speed Dash?

A Light Speed Dash is a blisteringly-fast move in which Sonic runs along a trail of rings at incredible speeds, gathering them as he goes. As Sonic collects rings, he builds up momentum and he can use this momentum to traverse levels in a flash.

## How to Execute a Light Speed Dash in Sonic Frontiers?

The Light Speed Dash is a little tricky to pull off, but with a bit of practice, you'll be blazing through levels in no time. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Collect Rings: The first step is to collect as many rings as possible. The Light Speed Dash can only be triggered when Sonic has a sufficient number of rings.

2. Look for an energy trail: Once you have the rings, you need to be on the lookout for an energy trail. This trail will be visible as a line of rings that are connected by a glow. These trails are usually found on the ground or on some walls.

3. Hold the Action Button: Once you have located a trail, hold the Action button (this varies depending on platform) to charge Sonic up. When charging Sonic up, the glow around the energy trail will become brighter and more intense.

4. Release the Action Button: Once the charge is complete, release the action button. Sonic will then dash along the energy trail, collecting all of the rings in his path.

## Tips and Tricks to Master the Light Speed Dash

The Sonic Frontiers game is all about speed and skill. Here are some tips and tricks to help you master the Light Speed Dash:

- Practice makes perfect: The Light Speed Dash is a difficult maneuver, so the more you practice, the better you'll get.

- Timing is everything: In order to successfully perform a Light Speed Dash, you need to have perfect timing. Wait until Sonic has fully charged up before releasing the action button.

- Keep collecting rings: The more rings you have, the faster Sonic will go. So, make sure you are constantly collecting rings to build up your speed and momentum.

- Watch your surroundings: Always be on the lookout for energy trails. They can be hidden in the environment, so keep an eye out for them.

- Experiment with different routes: The Light Speed Dash can be combined with other Sonic moves to create different routes through levels. Experiment with different moves to find the fastest possible route.

## Conclusion

The Light Speed Dash is one of Sonic's ultimate moves and is a challenging technique to master in Sonic Frontiers. With the tips and tricks provided in this article, you should be able to execute it seamlessly and with ease. So, get out there and start dashing through the levels at lightning speed!

This ability helps you move faster through the map and scale tricky territories. If you come across a line of rings, using this ability helps you gather them all at once. This also helps you cross certain areas which are inaccessible otherwise. You can activate the Light Speed Dash in Sonic Frontiers by pressing the L3 Button when you are near a set of rings. However, you can change the key binding in the settings. Using this ability will zoom you through the rings collecting them all. This ability can be very useful if you are hit by an enemy and regain the rings quickly.
 
This ability also resets Sonic’s Double Jump making it easier for you to move around on the map using a combination of both.
