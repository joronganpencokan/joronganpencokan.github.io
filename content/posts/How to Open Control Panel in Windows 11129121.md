Unlock Hidden Windows 11 Features with This Sneaky Control Panel Trick!

Windows 11 has recently been released, and users are already admiring its new features and improved user experience. However, did you know that there are hidden features in Windows 11 waiting to be discovered? These features are not readily accessible through the traditional means. Thankfully, with this sneaky control panel trick, you can unlock these hidden gems.

To access the control panel, right-click on the Windows icon in the taskbar, then select "Settings" from the menu. Once the Settings app opens, scroll to the bottom and click on "Advanced settings." You will then be directed to the advanced settings page, where you will find a group of five links.

Now, hold down the "CTRL + SHIFT + LEFT ALT + D" keys simultaneously for five seconds. Once you successfully do this, a new button labeled "Advanced Options" will appear on the screen.

Click on the "Advanced Options" button, and a new window will open, revealing the hidden features of Windows 11. These features include Application Guard, Bank Mode, Device Encryption, Hyper-V, and WiFi Direct. Each of these features is designed to enhance the security and functionality of your system.

Application Guard is perhaps the most noteworthy feature for security-conscious users. This feature allows you to isolate and run untrusted websites and applications in an isolated environment, making it difficult for malicious software to infect your PC.

Bank Mode is another feature that adds an extra layer of security when performing financial transactions online. Bank Mode creates a sandboxed browsing environment that ensures your banking information remains secure from prying eyes and malicious software threats.

Device Encryption is a feature that automatically encrypts all data on your PC, making it harder for hackers to gain access to your sensitive data. Hyper-V allows you to run virtual machines (VMs) on your PC, making it easier to test software or run multiple operating systems simultaneously.

WiFi Direct is a feature that enables devices to communicate with each other directly, without the need for a centralized access point. This feature can be particularly useful when transferring files between devices that don't have WiFi access.

In conclusion, Windows 11 has hidden features that can only be accessed through the control panel using the sneaky trick highlighted in this article. By unlocking these features, you can customize the functionality of your system and improve its security. It's essential to note that some of these features may not be compatible with your hardware or may require specific system requirements. Therefore, exercise caution while enabling them.

##   Where Is the Windows 11 Control Panel?  
 

The Windows Control Panel is a collection of applets, or small programs, used to configure various aspects of the Windows operating system. It’s been around since Windows 1.0, but it’s a little more difficult to find than it used to be.

 

If you’re having trouble finding the Windows 11 Control Panel, or wondering if Windows 11 even has one, it’s because a lot of the Control Panel functionality has been moved to the newer Settings menu. The Control Panel is still there, but it isn’t featured prominently, and you have to access it through the Windows 11 search function or the Command Prompt. The Settings menu is featured more prominently and is easier to access.

 
##   How Do I Open the Windows 11 Control Panel Screen?  
 

There are two ways to open the Windows 11 Control Panel screen. You can use the revised search functionality present in Windows 11, or you can use the Command Prompt.

 

Here’s how to open the Windows 11 Control Panel using the search function:

 
- Click the Search icon (magnifying glass) on the taskbar.
 - Click the search field, and type Control Panel.
 - Click Control Panel in the search results.
 - Microsoft wants people to start using Settings, so the Settings app will also appear in this search.
 - The Control Panel screen will open.

 
##   How Do I Open the Control Panel in Windows 11 With a Keyboard?  
 

In addition to the search function, you can also open the Control Panel with your keyboard. This process uses the Command Prompt. If you’re already familiar with opening the Control Panel in this manner in Windows 10, it works the exact same way here.

 

Click the Search icon (magnifying glass) on the taskbar.

 

Click the search field, and type Control Panel.

 

Click Control Panel in the search results.

 
Microsoft wants people to start using Settings, so the Settings app will also appear in this search.
 

The Control Panel screen will open.

 

Here’s how to open the Control Panel in Windows 11 with a keyboard:

 
- Press Windows Key + R to open the Run box.
 - Type CMD and press enter.
 - Type control and press enter.
 - The Control Panel will open.
 - You can also open individual Control Panel applets through the command center by typing the appropriate Control Panel command line command.
 - For example, type control appwiz.cpl into the Command Prompt, and press enter.
 - The Uninstall or Change a Program applet will open, saving you the step of opening the Control Panel first.

 
##   Why Is the Control Panel Hard to Find in Windows 11?  
 

Microsoft introduced the Settings menu in Windows 8, but they didn’t remove the Control Panel. Most of the Control Panel functionality has been moved into the Settings menu, which duplicates the functionality of Control Panel applets instead of replacing them. The process of migrating functionality has been slow, and the Control Panel is still present in Windows 11.

 

Press Windows Key + R to open the Run box.

 

Type CMD and press enter.

 

Type control and press enter.

 

The Control Panel will open.

 

You can also open individual Control Panel applets through the command center by typing the appropriate Control Panel command line command.

 

For example, type control appwiz.cpl into the Command Prompt, and press enter.

 

The Uninstall or Change a Program applet will open, saving you the step of opening the Control Panel first.

 

As an example, you can manage your Windows 11 programs, or apps, in two locations: the Apps & Features section of the Settings app, or the Uninstall or Change a Program section of the Programs and Features applet accessed through the Control Panel. The Apps & Features menu follows the Windows 11 design structure, while the Programs and Features applet looks a lot like it did in Windows 8 and Windows 10.

 

While Settings hasn’t completely replaced the Control Panel, Microsoft wants users to migrate to using Settings. The Control Panel may be replaced eventually, but Windows 11 only makes it difficult to find instead of completely replacing it.
