3. From the dropdown menu, select "Convert Text to Table."

4. In the Convert Text to Table dialog box, you can choose the number of columns and rows you want for your table. You can also choose whether you want to separate text by commas, tabs, or other delimiters.

5. Once you've selected your preferences, click "OK" and watch as the magic happens. Your text will instantly be converted into a perfectly formatted table.

6. Now you can easily edit and format your table using the standard table formatting tools.

This hack is particularly useful for anyone dealing with large amounts of data, such as researchers or writers. It saves an enormous amount of time and effort that would otherwise be spent manually inserting and formatting tables.
