##   Methods for Moving a Window That's Off-Screen in Windows 10  
 

You launch an app or program, but it's running off-screen, and you're not sure how to retrieve it. However, there are several ways to move a window that's off-screen in Windows 10. Some involve using different keys on the keyboard, while others involve adjusting settings in Windows 10.

 
###   Find Windows Using Arrow and Shift Keys  
 

This method uses the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move off-screen windows. 

 
- Launch the program or app (if it’s not opened already).
 - Press the Shift key and right-click the active program or app icon located on the taskbar.
 - Select Move from the pop-up menu.
 - Press the left arrow or right arrow key until the program or app appears on the screen.

 
###   Find Windows Using Arrow and Windows Keys  
 

A similar method swaps out the Shift key for the Windows key. It also relies on the snapping feature that snaps windows to the sides of your screen.

 

Launch the program or app (if it’s not opened already).

 

Press the Shift key and right-click the active program or app icon located on the taskbar.

 

Select Move from the pop-up menu.

 

Press the left arrow or right arrow key until the program or app appears on the screen.

 
- Launch the program or app (if it’s not opened already).
 - Select the active app or program icon located on the taskbar to make it the current selection.
 - Long-press the Windows key while pressing either the left arrow or right arrow key.

 
###   Find Windows Using Arrow Keys and Mouse  
 

This version doesn’t use the Shift or Windows keys. Instead, the mouse cursor helps bring your lost windows back to the home screen.

 
This second method moves the missing window to three specific locations: Snapped to the right, to the center, and snapped to the left.
 

Select the active app or program icon located on the taskbar to make it the current selection.

 

Long-press the Windows key while pressing either the left arrow or right arrow key.

 
- Launch the program or app (if it’s not opened already).
 - Hover your mouse cursor over the active program or app located on the taskbar until a thumbnail appears.
 - Right-click on the thumbnail and select Move on the menu.
 - Move the mouse cursor—now switched to a four-arrow "move" symbol – to the middle of your screen.
 - Use the left arrow or right arrow key to move the missing window into the viewable area. You can also move your mouse while the missing window "sticks" to your pointer.
 - Press the Enter key.

 
###   Change Screen Resolution to Find a Lost Window  
 

Changing your screen resolution can pull lost windows into the main screen. These windows remain stationary on your desktop despite their hidden presence. You basically “zoom the camera” out until the missing windows appear in the frame.

 

Hover your mouse cursor over the active program or app located on the taskbar until a thumbnail appears.

 

Right-click on the thumbnail and select Move on the menu.

 

Move the mouse cursor—now switched to a four-arrow "move" symbol – to the middle of your screen.

 

Use the left arrow or right arrow key to move the missing window into the viewable area. You can also move your mouse while the missing window "sticks" to your pointer.

 

Press the Enter key.

 
- Right-click the desktop.
 - Select Display settings on the menu.
 - Select Display in the side panel and choose one of the resolutions in the Advanced scaling settings section to temporarily change the resolution until the program or app appears on the screen.
 - Using your mouse, move the program or app to the center of your screen.
 - Change the screen resolution back to its original setting.

 
###   Unhide Windows With the Desktop Toggle  
 

This doesn’t require a series of steps. Simply press the Windows key+D. All programs and apps disappear the first time you type this combo. Do it again, and everything—including your missing windows—should reappear.

 

Right-click the desktop.

 

Select Display settings on the menu.

 

Select Display in the side panel and choose one of the resolutions in the Advanced scaling settings section to temporarily change the resolution until the program or app appears on the screen.

 

Using your mouse, move the program or app to the center of your screen.

 

Change the screen resolution back to its original setting.

 
###   Use Cascade to Arrange Windows  
 

This feature arranges all windows in a cascade, stacking the title bars like an old-school card catalog.

 
- Right-click an empty space on the taskbar.
 - Select Cascade windows.
 - The open windows are rearranged into a cascade, including your missing windows.

 
##   Methods for Moving a Window That Is Off-Screen in macOS  
 

Like Windows, there are several ways to move a window in macOS to find the one you're looking for. If you opened something and it's showing off-screen, try these tips to make it reappear.

 

Right-click an empty space on the taskbar.

 

Select Cascade windows.

 

The open windows are rearranged into a cascade, including your missing windows.

 
###   Change the Resolution  
 

Your lost window doesn’t change its position. By altering the resolution, you’re "zoom the camera" out until the missing window appears in the frame.

 
- Click the Apple icon located in the top left corner and select System Preferences.
 - Click Displays.
 - Click the radio button next to Scaled in the Display tab and choose a different resolution.
 - Click OK to confirm.

 
###   Force a Relaunch  
 

Forcing an app or program to relaunch on a Mac could bring the window back into view so you can access it again.

 

Click the Apple icon located in the top left corner and select System Preferences.

 

Click Displays.

 

Click the radio button next to Scaled in the Display tab and choose a different resolution.

 

Click OK to confirm.

 
- Click the Apple icon located in the top left corner.
 - Select Force Quit.
 - Choose the off-screen application from the list and click Relaunch.

 
###   Use Window Zoom to Make a Window Appear  
 

Unlike changing the resolution, this version zooms the app or program until it appears on your screen. Once it emerges, drag it fully onto your display.

 

Click the Apple icon located in the top left corner.

 

Select Force Quit.

 

Choose the off-screen application from the list and click Relaunch.

 
- Click the active program or app shown on the Dock.
 - Click Window in the Apple menu bar and select Zoom in the drop-down menu.

 
###   Center the Window to Make It Visible  
 

This is a simple, neat trick using your Mac’s Option key.

 

Click the active program or app shown on the Dock.

 

Click Window in the Apple menu bar and select Zoom in the drop-down menu.

 
- If the off-screen app or program isn’t actively selected, click its icon on the Dock.
 - Hold down the Option key and click the active app or program icon again. This hides the app or program.
 - Release the Option key and click the active app or program icon for a third time. The window reappears centered on your screen.

 

If the off-screen app or program isn’t actively selected, click its icon on the Dock.

 

Hold down the Option key and click the active app or program icon again. This hides the app or program.

 

Release the Option key and click the active app or program icon for a third time. The window reappears centered on your screen.

 
- How do I drag an off-screen window back onto my screen with a mouse?
 - In short, you can't simply drag a window that's off-screen using only your mouse. Mouse movement is limited to your computer's screen, so it won't be able to go outside of it to retrieve the hidden windows.
 - Why are windows disappearing when I minimize them?
 - This is most likely caused by a taskbar settings, which can be adjusted to "Hide When Minimized." Right-click on the icon in the taskbar for the application that's having the problem, then select turn off Hide When Minimized and it should take care of the problem.
