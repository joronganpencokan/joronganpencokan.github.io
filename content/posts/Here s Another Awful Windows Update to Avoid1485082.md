Another Windows Update is Out and It's a Total Disaster! Don't Download until You Read This!

If you haven't heard by now, the latest Windows update is causing some major problems for users. Reports of various issues are flooding in, leaving many users with non-functioning computers. Before you hit that "update" button, here's what you need to know.

What's the issue?

The problem with the latest Windows update is that it is causing random crashes, freezes, and even boot problems for some users. The update was intended to fix certain bugs and improve performance, but it seems that it has done the opposite.

Reports suggest that the update is causing errors with the operating system's file management in the background, which can result in unstable system behavior. Some users have experienced blue screen errors, while others have problems with devices that were previously functioning normally.

Should I update?

At this time, it is best to hold off on updating until Microsoft has acknowledged and resolved the issues. With reports of significant problems, the update appears to be not yet available on some devices, but it is better not to take any chances.

What should I do if I've already updated?

If you are one of the unlucky users experiencing problems after updating, there are a few things you can try. First, try to revert your system to the previous version of Windows. This will restore your computer to the state it was in before the update. If this does not work or is not feasible, you may need to contact Microsoft support for further assistance.

Final thoughts

Windows updates are typically essential for maintaining system security and performance, but this latest update is causing significant issues for users. Until the issues are resolved, it is best to hold off on updating. If you have already updated and are experiencing problems, try to revert your system to the previous version, and if that doesn't work, contact Microsoft support for help.

The latest update for Windows 10, KB4556799, is reportedly causing a host of issues for many users of Microsoft's operating system, including a Blue Screen of Death, flickering monitors, font weirdness, reversion to Windows 10S, and audio problems.

 
The latest update for Windows is causing major errors; you may want to avoid (or roll back) the update.
 

Cause for alarm? It's possible this security update may result in similar issues for you, though one expert told Lifewire the scale of the problem may be overstated.

 

Not macOS: You may wonder why Windows keeps having these sorts of issues with updates. One of the things Microsoft must contend with is a much wider range of hardware and software that may or may not be compatible with updated code. Apple more often avoids this problem by keeping tight control over both its hardware and software, resulting in fewer catastrophic issues after updates (though it's not completely free of issues).

 

Options: If the stream of bad updates has got you down, you can revert back to the previous Windows 10 version or you can be more proactive and stop automatic updates altogether. It's possible your PC will be just fine with the latest update—it's not affecting everyone—so you won't have to worry if you've already applied it and things are going well.
