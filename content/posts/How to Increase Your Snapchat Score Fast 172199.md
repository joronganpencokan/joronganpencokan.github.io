# Unleash Your Inner Snapchat Pro: Discover the Top Secret Tips to Skyrocket Your Score in Record Time!

If you are a Snapchat user, you know that your snap score reflects your activity on the app. The higher your score, the more active you are. However, not everyone knows how to increase their score in record time. In this article, we will uncover the top secret tips to skyrocket your score and help you unleash your inner Snapchat pro!

## Tip 1: Send More Snaps

One of the easiest ways to increase your snap score is by sending more snaps. The more snaps you send, the more points you earn. However, this doesn’t mean you should just send anything to anyone. Make sure you send snaps to your closest friends and family members. Also, try to vary the content of your snaps. You can send pictures, videos, and even try using the different filters and lenses available on the app.

## Tip 2: Post More Stories

Another way to increase your snap score is by posting more stories. Stories are a great way to keep your friends and followers up-to-date with your activities. You can share anything from your daily routine to your travels and adventures. Stories also allow you to use different filters and stickers, making them even more fun and engaging.

## Tip 3: Add More Friends

Adding more friends is a great way to increase your snap score. The more friends you have on Snapchat, the more opportunities you have to send snaps and receive them. You don't have to add random people, but be sure to add people you know and interact with in real life. You can find new friends by syncing your contact list or by using the ‘Add Nearby’ feature.

## Tip 4: Use Snap Map and Snapstreaks

Snap Map and Snapstreaks are two features that can help you skyrocket your snap score. Snap Map allows you to see where your friends are, which can lead to more conversations and snaps. Snapstreaks are achieved when you and a friend send snaps to each other consecutively for three days or more. The longer the streak, the higher the score. Just be sure to keep the streak going, or it will disappear!

## Tip 5: Participate in Lenses Challenges

Snapchat frequently releases lenses challenges, which are a great way to engage with your friends and followers. Participating in these challenges can help increase your snap score, as well as your popularity on the app. You can find these challenges by checking the lens carousel or by browsing the discover section.

## Conclusion

Increasing your snap score is a fun way to engage with your friends and followers on Snapchat. By following these top secret tips, you can unleash your inner Snapchat pro and skyrocket your score in record time! Remember to send more snaps, post more stories, add more friends, use Snap Map and Snapstreaks, and participate in lenses challenges. Happy snapping!

You might now be wondering about increasing your Snapchat score? Well, here are some  tips that may help you with it:
 
1. Try to share Snaps with multiple contacts: You get one point for each snap shared with one contact, but you get one more point if you share the same snap amongst multiple connections at the same time. In this way, you can gain an additional point by sharing a snap with numerous contacts.

Note: Replaying the same snaps will not have any effect on your Snapchat Score.
 
4. Add celebrities to your Snapchat account: You can add known celebrities to your Snapchat account to increase your score. Celebrities won’t even see your snaps, and you would get one point without much effort. On the other hand, your friends might get annoyed by the snaps you share with them. So, if it’s a risk you are willing to take, go ahead with it.
 
5. Add new friends on Snapchat: Adding new friends does not cost you anything. Even if you don’t know them, you can add them and increase your score. But avoid sharing snaps with them, in order to maintain your privacy as well as their comfort.
