# Discover the Secret Trick to Keep Windows Running Even When You Close Your Laptop Lid!

If you’re reading this, chances are you own a Windows laptop, and like many users, you may have wondered why your computer goes into sleep mode when you close the lid. While this is a useful feature to conserve battery life, it can be inconvenient if you want to keep your PC running, say, to download a large file or finish a lengthy calculation. Fortunately, there’s a simple trick to prevent your laptop from sleeping when you shut the lid. Here’s how.

First, click on the Start button and type “power options” in the search box. Click on the “Power & Sleep Settings” item that appears in the menu. This will take you to the Power & Sleep page of the Windows Settings app, where you can adjust various power-related settings. 

Next, click on the “Additional power settings” link at the bottom of the page. This will open a new window called Power Options, which shows you the power plans available on your PC. A power plan is a collection of system settings that control how your computer uses power, such as the brightness of the screen, the time it takes to turn off the display, and the speed at which the processor runs.

Now, select the power plan that you want to modify by clicking on the “Change plan settings” link next to it. This will show you the settings for that plan, including options to adjust the display and sleep settings. 

To prevent your laptop from sleeping when you close the lid, click on the “Change advanced power settings” link at the bottom of the page. This will open a new window called Power Options: Advanced Settings, which displays dozens of power settings you can tweak. 

Scroll down until you see an item called “Lid close action” and click on the plus sign (+) next to it to expand it. You’ll see two options: “On battery” and “Plugged in.” Click on each of these options in turn, and under “Setting,” select “Do nothing” from the drop-down list. This means that when you close the lid, Windows will not go to sleep or hibernation mode, but will continue to run, just as if the lid were open.

Make sure to click on the “Apply” button before closing the window. You can then close the Settings app and test the new setting by closing the laptop lid. You should see that the computer remains on, and you can resume your work or downloads without interruption.

It’s worth noting that keeping your laptop running with the lid closed will consume more power, so you may want to keep it plugged in to avoid draining the battery too quickly. You should also be careful not to block the air vents or use your laptop on soft surfaces like pillows or blankets, as this can cause it to overheat and damage the components.

In conclusion, learning how to prevent Windows from sleeping when you close the laptop lid is a useful trick that can save you time and frustration. By following the simple steps above, you can keep your computer running even when you’re not using it directly, and avoid the inconvenience of having to wake it up every time you need it. Try it out today and see the difference it makes!

When you close the laptop lid, the default behavior for Windows is to go to Sleep. This helps to conserve power and save your battery life. However, there are times when you need Windows to continue running in the background even though the laptop lid is closed. Here is how you can get it done in Windows 10.
 
## Keeping the Laptop Working
 
In Windows, click on the notifications tray near the lower-right corner of the screen. At the bottom of the section is a list of options, one of which is “All Settings” and is represented by a gear icon. Tap on this option.
 
A new window will open revealing the Settings page for your Windows 10 program. This is the part of Windows 10 which controls the look and functioning of your laptop’s various programs.
 
Go to the System section of the Settings page.
 
Scroll down the list of options to the left of the screen. Click on the “Power and Sleep” option. To the right of the page, select “Additional Power Settings.”
 
A new screen will open to reveal the control panel with a list of options to the left. Tap on “Choose what closing the lid does.”
 
On the new page you will see the option, “When I close the lid.” By default, this option is set to Sleep, but this can be changed.
 
On the drop-down menu next to it, select “Do nothing.” You can choose this option for your laptop when it is plugged in and charging or when the laptop is operating on battery power alone, depending on your requirements. Both these options are listed side by side on the same page.
 
Once you have adjusted the settings, go to the bottom of the screen and click on “Save Changes.”
 
Now whenever you close the lid of the laptop, it will not go to sleep but will continue to run in the background.
 
If you have decided to let Windows 10 continue running after the laptop lid is closed, you may also want to optimize your laptop battery life in Windows 10 to make sure it doesn’t waste your battery when you are not around.
