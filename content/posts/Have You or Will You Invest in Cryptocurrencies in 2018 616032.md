Are you considering taking the plunge into the world of cryptocurrency? Many people are, and for good reason. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum have exploded in value over the last year, making early investors incredibly rich.

But is now really the right time to jump onboard? Let's explore the reasons why millions of people are embracing the digital gold rush right now.

## Cryptocurrencies Are Going Mainstream

You no longer need to be a tech whiz or financial expert to invest in cryptocurrencies. Major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are getting on board, making it easier for everyday investors to get involved.

Additionally, more and more businesses are accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services. This means that these digital currencies are becoming more widely accepted and more mainstream by the day, signalling to many that it may be time to invest.

## Blockchain Technology is The Future

Blockchain technology, which serves as the backbone of cryptocurrencies, has the potential to revolutionize virtually any industry. It's a decentralized ledger that records transactions securely and transparently, with records stored on a network of computers rather than a central server.

For sectors like finance, healthcare, and logistics, blockchain tech may offer tremendous benefits in terms of security, tracking, and efficiency. As this technology becomes more widely adopted, the value of cryptocurrencies is likely to increase.

## Limited Supply and Growing Demand

Perhaps the most compelling argument for investing in cryptocurrencies is their limited supply. For example, Bitcoin has a total cap of 21 million coins, of which nearly 17 million have already been mined. This makes Bitcoin a scarce resource and many believe that its value will only continue to rise as demand grows.

As more people enter the world of cryptocurrency, demand for these digital assets is set to continue to rise. Some predict that we are only just beginning to scratch the surface of the potential value of cryptocurrencies.

## The Risks and Rewards of Cryptocurrency

Of course, investing in cryptocurrency is not without its risks. The sector is still largely unregulated, meaning that you need to be careful to avoid fraudsters and scams.

Additionally, the value of cryptocurrencies can be incredibly volatile. Prices have been known to swing wildly in a short amount of time, often for seemingly no reason.

However, for those willing to take a calculated risk, the potential rewards are enormous. Those who got in early on Bitcoin, for example, have seen their investment grow by over a thousand percent in just a few short years.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, many people believe that 2018 is the year to take the cryptocurrency plunge. With mainstream adoption on the rise, blockchain technology gaining momentum, and a limited supply of coins available, the potential for significant gains is clear.

Just be sure to do your research and invest wisely. Cryptocurrency may not be for everyone, but for those willing to take a risk, the rewards may be well worth it.

One topic that is often in the news lately is cryptocurrencies. There has been much discussion on the worthiness of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and whether or not it’s worthwhile to invest at this time. We asked our writers, “Have you or will you invest in cryptocurrencies in 2018?”
 
## Our Opinion
 
Miguel says he might, but he “wouldn’t encourage people to hop on too quickly” because “making such an investment carries massive risks because of the low trading volume in these cryptocurrencies in comparison to fiat currency.” He believes they are “susceptible to volatility and pump-and-dump schemes.”
 
Robert also thinks he may be, reasoning “So long as people treat whatever money they invest as ‘money wasted’ or money they can afford to waste, they can take a ‘punt.’ “ He sees the word “punt” as a good way to describe the situation because “so much of this market is just based on speculation.” But if you’re looking for safe, stable investments that you can sit comfortably with for years, he suggests you look elsewhere. He stresses, though, that he’s no expert on the matter.
 

 
It’s not something that crosses Phil’s mind, as he doesn’t have any free money to invest. However, like Miguel, he would be “very concerned about the volatile nature of cryptocurrency and how unlinked it is from world markets.” While admittedly finance is always virtual and intangible, with “currencies based on real case made in real banks, you have some notion there are real banknotes somewhere with your name” and that they won’t suddenly be worth nothing.
 
Damien won’t be putting his money into cryptocurrencies this year “with its current volatile nature.” He’s keeping an open mind, however, noting he will “adopt a wait-and-see approach and see how it progresses this year.”
 
Simon believes it looks like an “if you have money you don’t mind losing, give it a shot” scenario. He can’t fault anyone who wants to jump in who has money to burn and wants in on the “exciting world of cryptocurrency.” Regardless, he’s not willing to jump into it himself right now so will be missing it.
 
Ada does have small investments in cryptocurrencies and notes that so far she hasn’t suffered any losses. She plans to continue to invest but notes she will “try to diversify” her portfolio. “No major amounts, though; it’s too volatile.”
 
Alex notes, “Considering the near certainty of a major correction, I’ll be holding out for now to wait and see what happens in the market.”
 
Seeing it as “much too speculative,” Ryan won’t be investing in cryptocurrencies either. He explains they are “essentially a commodity and not a currency” and are “only worth as much as someone is willing to pay for them.” This is because “unlike standard commodities like gold, cryptocurrencies are not backed by anything tangible, meaning they can soar, or drastically decline, in value at the whim of the public.” Yet if you have money you don’t mind losing, he thinks it could be fun.
 
As for myself, I’m not into investing at all. I’m just not into finances at all. I’m not particularly fond of dealing with regular paper money currency, so I have no desire to deal with a digital version of currency. But even if I did, I wouldn’t be trying cryptocurrencies just yet. I feel it’s too early in the process to jump in.
