Selfies are among the most popular types of photos taken today. They are a great way of capturing memories and sharing them with the world. But what if there was a way to take your selfies to the next level? What if you could turn them into stunning stickers that you could use on social media or even print out for your scrapbook?

Well, the good news is that it is entirely possible, and you can do it in just a few minutes. Thanks to advancements in technology and a few nifty apps, you can now turn your selfies into personalized stickers that will blow your friends and family away.

Here's how to go about it:

## Step 1: Choose Your Image

The first step in turning your selfie into a sticker is to choose the right image. You should opt for a photo that has a clear and simple background. Avoid images with cluttered backgrounds or ones that have too many objects in them.

Once you have selected the perfect image, you can move on to the next step.

## Step 2: Download and Install Sticker Maker Apps

There are several sticker maker apps available in the market that you can use to create stunning stickers. One such app is Sticker Maker. This app is easy to use, and it allows you to upload your image, cut out the background, and turn it into a sticker. Other apps that you may consider include Sticker.ly and Sticker Studio.

## Step 3: Edit Your Image

Now that you have your app of choice, it's time to edit your image. You can use the tools provided by the app to crop, resize or adjust the colors of your selfie. The app will also allow you to cut out the background from your image, leaving only your face or any other object in the photo.

If you have basic editing skills, you can also use a more advanced image editing software like Adobe Photoshop or Affinity Designer to edit your image. But keep in mind that these options may require a bit more time and effort.

## Step 4: Turn Your Image into a Sticker

Once you have edited your selfie and are happy with the results, it's time to turn it into a sticker. In the Sticker Maker app, you can click on the "+" icon and select your edited image. You can then crop the image and add a border or text to your sticker.

## Step 5: Share Your Sticker With the World!

Congratulations! You have created your very own personalized sticker. You can now use your sticker on social media or messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram. You can also print out your sticker and use it to decorate your scrapbook or planner.

In conclusion, turning your selfies into stunning stickers is an easy and fun way to add a personal touch to your photos.

You can now create personalized stickers based on your face on the all-new Gboard. You can send these stickers to anyone through text messages or on any app that supports stickers. This may sound familiar to Bitmoji or Selfie Stickers on Google Allo, but Minis (is what they are calling this) is much more. These “Minis” are build by using machine learning. Here’s how to make stickers from selfies.
 
## Make stickers from selfies
 
First, you need to download Gboard. If you already have the app, make sure you’re on the latest version by checking its page on the Google Play Store. This feature is only available on version 7.5 and above.
 
Now that you’ve downloaded Gboard, you need to make sure that it is set as the default keyboard on your device. To do so, you need to head over to Settings > System > Languages and Input > tap on Virtual keyboard > Manage Keyboards and then turn on Gboard. You do not have to do this if you’ve only updated the app and it is already the default keyboard.
 
Now that everything has been set up, you can take the new Gboard for a test drive. Choose an app that supports stickers and lets you access the keyboard. On the left-hand side of the space bar, there’s an emoji icon; you need to tap on it to open the menu. Tap on the sticker icon in the middle and then tap on “Mini” icon located at the left side. Select Create.
 
Your secondary camera will open to let you take a selfie. Make sure you put your head within the lines on the screen to ensure good results. Gboard will now get to work with its machine learning and database to create your sticker. After that’s been done, you can fine-tune your stickers according to your liking. You can customize everything from the hair color to hairstyles and more.
 
You can access these stickers by tapping the Emoji button and then selecting stickers. Go through the collection to find the appropriate one.
