# Are You Tired of Strangers Stalking Your Instagram? Learn the SECRETS to Keep Your Account Private!

We all know that Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world. With over 1 billion active monthly users, it has become a standard form of communication and sharing for many of us. However, with the increasing amount of individuals using the social media platforms, many users have become concerned with their online privacy, and the protection of their personal data.

One of the biggest privacy concerns is the amount of stalking and harassment that happens on Instagram. Strangers can easily find and follow your profile, and view all of your personal data, posts, and interactions. This can be dangerous and intimidating, especially if you are a female or a person of minority. In this article, we will discuss the secrets to keeping your Instagram account private and secure, so that you can enjoy your social media experience without worrying about strangers stalking your Instagram.

Here are some of the steps to keep your account private:

## Set Your Account to Private

The first step to keeping your Instagram account private is to ensure that your account is set to private. When your account is set to private, only people who follow you can see your posts, stories, and comments. This means that strangers can't find and follow your profile without your permission. To do this, simply go to your profile settings and choose "privacy and security." Then, select "account privacy" and turn on the "private account" option.

## Control Who Can Follow You

With your account now set to private, you can now control who can follow you. By default, only your followers can see your posts and stories on Instagram. However, you can also change this setting to allow only people you approve to see your content. This gives you complete control over who has access to your personal data, and ensures that strangers cannot follow your profile without your permission.

## Be Careful with Your Hashtags

Lastly, it is important to be careful with the hashtags you use on Instagram. Hashtags are a way for other users to find your posts and follow you. However, if you use common hashtags, like #followme or #instafamous, you are more likely to attract unwanted attention from strangers. Instead, use specific hashtags that relate to your posts, such as #photography or #foodporn.

Wrapping Up

In conclusion, Instagram is an excellent platform to share your life with friends and family. However, with the increasing number of strangers on the platform, it is important to ensure your account is private and secure. By following these simple steps, you can protect your privacy and limit the amount of unnecessary attention your profile attracts. Keep these tips in mind, and enjoy your Instagram experience without worrying about strangers stalking your profile.

If you decide to make your Instagram account private, your posts will be seen only by your followers, and any hashtags you use will be hidden from searches. Here's how it works on the Instagram app on Android and iOS devices.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Tap your profile icon and tap Menu > Settings > Privacy. Under Account Privacy, toggle on Private Account.If you want your profile to be visible again, return to the Account Privacy menu and toggle off Private Account.

 
##   Make Your Instagram Account Private  
 

Making your profile private is quite simple. Here are the steps to getting it done, as explained using the Instagram iPhone app:

 
- Tap your profile icon in the lower-right corner of the screen.
 - Tap Menu (three horizontal lines) in the upper-right corner of the screen.
 - Tap Settings.
 - Tap Privacy.
 - Under Account Privacy, toggle on Private Account.
 - If it's not your whole profile you want to make private, but just a few pictures, you also have the option to hide select photos on your Instagram account. The option is in the photo menu.

 
##   Making Your Profile Public  
 

If you change your mind and want your profile to be visible again, return to the Account Privacy screen following the steps above and toggle Private Account off again. Additionally, if you're 16 or under when you create your Instagram, your profile will be set to private by default. You'll need to turn the privacy setting off manually to let everyone see your feed.

Tap Settings.

 

Tap Privacy.

 

Under Account Privacy, toggle on Private Account.

- What if I tag a user or add a hashtag to one of my Instagram posts when my profile is set to profile? Can people still see it?
 - Only the users who follow you will be able to see it. Tagging other users who don't follow you or putting a hashtag in the description does not override the privacy of the post. It will not be visible to anyone else who does not follow you already.
 - What if I want to share an Instagram post on other social network sites when my profile is set to private?
 - If you decide to share a post to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Flickr, or another social network, it will be publicly accessible to view as a standalone post. Anyone viewing it will be able to click on the Instagram permalink to view it in full, but if they click on your username to view your full profile, they will not be able to see your other content unless they follow you already.
 - If someone decides to follow me while my profile is private, will they be able to see my posts?
 - Not until you approve them. When one user taps the Follow button on a user whose profile is private, it only sends a follow request message. So if you get a follow request from someone, they will not be able to see any of your content until you manually approve their request to follow you.
 - Someone is following me, but I don't want them as a follower anymore. How do I get rid of this person?
 - To stop someone from following you, block the account. Open their profile, tap the three dots in the top-right corner, then tap Block User to remove that account from your followers. (If the account holder is behaving inappropriately, consider reporting the account.)
