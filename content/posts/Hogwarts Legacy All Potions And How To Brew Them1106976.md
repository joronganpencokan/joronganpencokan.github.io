### How to Brew Potions
 
To brew Potions in Hogwarts Legacy, you will need the recipe and ingredients. Then, you’ll have to use them at the Brewing Station in the Room of Requirements. You’ll also have to attend the Potions class. But don’t worry, you won’t have Professor Snape as this game is set in a timeline where Phineas Nigellus Black was the Headmaster. Brewing will work via quick-time events, meaning you’ll have to press the prompted button to get it right.
