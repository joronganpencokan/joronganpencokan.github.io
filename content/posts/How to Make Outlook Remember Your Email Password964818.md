Are you tired of constantly entering your email password whenever you want to access your Outlook account? Well, there is a simple hack that will unlock the secret to never entering your password again.

Outlook has a feature called "App Passwords" that will enable you to create a unique password you can use for your email account. This password is specific to the app or device you want to use to access your account, so you don't have to worry about anyone else gaining access to your account.

Here is how you can set up an App Password:

Step 1: Login to your Microsoft account and click on Security from the drop-down menu on the top right corner of the page.

Step 2: Click on the "More security options" link, and you will be taken to the Security settings page.

Step 3: Scroll down until you see the "App passwords" section and click on "Create a new app password."

Step 4: Name your App Password and click on "Next."

Step 5: Outlook will generate a unique password for you. Copy the password and keep it somewhere safe, like a password manager.

Step 6: Open Outlook and go to File > Account Settings > Account Settings.

Step 7: In the Email tab, double-click on your email account.

Step 8: In the dialog box, paste the App Password you just created in the Password field and click on "Next."

Step 9: Outlook will save the App Password, and you can now access your account without entering your email password again.

That's it! You can create multiple App Passwords for different devices or apps, and you can revoke them at any time in case you lose your phone or change your mind.

So, next time you are tired of entering your email password every time you want to access your Outlook account, remember this simple hack and unlock the secret to never entering your password again!

##   How to Make Outlook Remember Your Email Password  
 

Microsoft Outlook requires that you type your password into a password box each time you access your email. This is great for security purposes, but if you're the only one who uses your computer, it's safe to store your password in Outlook.

 

When you make Outlook remember your password, you can receive and send mail without typing your password each time you open Outlook. Plus, you can make a complex password that you don't need to remember or constantly retrieve from your password manager.

 - Lifewire.
 - Select Info.

 - Select Account Settings > Account Settings.
 - Lifewire.
 - In the Account Settings dialog box, select the email address for which you want Outlook to remember the password, then select Change.

 - In the Exchange Account Settings dialog box, select More Settings.
 - Lifewire.
 - In the Microsoft Exchange dialog box, go to the Security tab and clear the Always prompt for logon credentials checkbox.
 - Lifewire.
 - Select Apply to apply the changes, then choose OK to close the window.
 - In the Exchange Account Settings dialog box, select Close (X).
 - In the Account Settings dialog box, select Close.
 - Restart Outlook.

 
##   Outlook Keeps Asking for the Password  
 

If Outlook asks you to enter your password every time you check mail even though you set Outlook to not prompt for your login credentials, it could be happening for several reasons.

 

Go to the File tab.

 

Select Info.

 

Select Account Settings > Account Settings.

 

In the Account Settings dialog box, select the email address for which you want Outlook to remember the password, then select Change.

 

In the Exchange Account Settings dialog box, select More Settings.

 

In the Microsoft Exchange dialog box, go to the Security tab and clear the Always prompt for logon credentials checkbox.

 

Select Apply to apply the changes, then choose OK to close the window.

 

In the Exchange Account Settings dialog box, select Close (X).

 

In the Account Settings dialog box, select Close.

 

Restart Outlook.

 

The most likely situation is that you changed your password for the email account but didn't update the password in Outlook. Follow the steps above to go to the Account Settings dialog box that lists your email address and password, then change the password to the updated one so that Outlook stops asking you for it.

 

If Outlook continues to ask for your password, temporarily disable your antivirus (AV) program or boot into Safe Mode if you're in Windows. The antivirus program could be interfering with Outlook if it uses an add-in or firewall. If Outlook checks for and sends mail without asking for a password after doing one of these two things, reinstall the AV program.

 

If the AV software isn't to blame, or if you still suspect that it is, start Outlook in safe mode to disable add-ins. If the password works after doing this, there's a problem with one of the add-ins and you need to disable it, delete it, or troubleshoot how to fix it.

 

For situations in which Outlook still doesn't remember the password, either delete the email profile and make a new one or remove the program and install it again. There might be an error in the profile, in which case building a new one will fix the problem.

 

It's also possible that there are incorrect settings in the Windows Registry for the Protected Storage System Provider. To see if this is the problem, follow Microsoft's directions to delete the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Protected Storage System Provider key.
