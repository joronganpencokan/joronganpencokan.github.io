Body:
The key to defeating Warden Garcia is to focus on his attacks and know when to strike back. Garcia has various attacks that deal heavy damage and can quickly deplete your health bar. However, he also has openings that players can exploit to inflict heavy damage. Here are the steps you need to follow to defeat Warden Garcia with ease:

Step 1: Focus on Dodging
Garcia's attacks are mostly melee-based, so you need to focus on dodging and getting out of his range. To do that, keep moving and roll through his attacks. Make sure you roll in the opposite direction of his attack to avoid taking damage.

Step 2: Use Your Drone
Your drone can be a useful tool to distract Warden Garcia and deal damage to him. When Garcia is attacking you, use your drone to target him and shoot him. This will cause him to focus on the drone, giving you an opportunity to attack his back or sides.

Step 3: Pay Attention to Garcia's Shoulder
Garcia's right shoulder is his weak point, and you need to focus on it to deal massive damage. When Garcia attacks you, dodge it and target his shoulder with your weapon. Continuous attacks will open up his defenses and deal a lot of damage.

When Garcia's health is low, he will start using a shield to protect his weak points. Use finishing moves to break his shield and expose his weak points. This will enable you to inflict even more damage to defeat him quickly.

## How To Kill Warden Garcia
 
Warden Garcia is a fully armored boss not like Nitro, who does not wear a helmet. The key to defeating this boss is by performing a lot of defensive moves that is Evade instead of attacking him. He is quick to recover back after the attack and releases a different type of attacks in a short time. So Evade is the key to win here, Press A+L to Evade, refer the instructions on the screen for PC and PS4.
 
Whenever the boss is prepping for attack he will run towards you. He has a knife kind of weapon attached to his hand, he can swing left and right with high speed due to the weapon’s swiftness. Wait for his jump, when is down on the ground with a swipe hit, attack him with the Gauger because this weapon is fast and it does require you to go near to the boss. Best is to run backward and then press A+L to evade, he can also shoot explosives so be ready to dodge.
 
The best cover for you is the huge columns in the room, keep running around it, and whenever you had a chance to use the Gauger to hit his head. Keep an eye on your Stamina, if it is out you cannot dodge fast. The second most annoying thing is the Drone, who will appear in between to shoot you. Stay away from the laser sight at all cost.
 
Killing Warden Garcia boss in The Surge 2 will take time, so be patient. Attack and evade as fast as possible, his attacks are repetitive. You can understand that well in the start, try moving it around the pillars in the room so that you can evade left and right fast avoid the Drone and explosive attacks. The highest damage attack is when he swings his knife and bows down a little before taking a jump. If you are fast enough to use the Gauger you can eat his health fast.
 
I tried blocking these attacks but it failed, Warden Garcia is a pretty strong boss, so use the above strategy to kill him.
