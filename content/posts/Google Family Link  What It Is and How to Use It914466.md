Have you heard about the latest feature in Google's Family Link app? It's supposed to help parents keep their children safe online, but it's not as simple as it seems. In fact, if you don't know how to use it properly, it could actually compromise your child's online safety.

Here's what you need to know about this new feature and how to use it to protect your child.

What is Google Family Link?

First, let's recap what Family Link is. It's an app that lets parents manage their child's digital activity on their Android or Chromebook device. With Family Link, you can:

- Set screen time limits and bedtimes
- Approve or block app downloads and purchases
- View your child's activity and app usage
- Set content filters and safe search options
- Locate your child's device

Overall, it's a useful tool for parents who want to monitor and control their child's device use.

What's the new feature in Family Link?

The latest feature in Family Link is called "SafeSearch for Google Chrome." It's designed to filter explicit content from Google search results on your child's device. When enabled, it blocks explicit images, videos, and websites from appearing in the search results.

Sounds great, right? The problem is, enabling SafeSearch isn't as straightforward as it should be. In fact, it can be downright complicated if you don't know what you're doing.

How to use SafeSearch in Family Link

To start using SafeSearch, you need to:

1. Make sure your child is using a supported Android device or Chromebook
2. Install the latest version of the Google Chrome browser on their device
3. Update the Family Link app on your own device to the latest version
4. Enable SafeSearch in the Family Link app

Enabling SafeSearch involves going through several steps, including requesting permission from Google to turn it on. If you're not familiar with how Family Link works, it can be overwhelming.

But the truth is, enabling SafeSearch is only part of the picture - it's not a foolproof solution. If you rely solely on SafeSearch to protect your child from explicit content online, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.

Other ways to protect your child's online safety

Here are some additional steps you can take to ensure your child stays safe online:

1. Talk to your child about online safety and set boundaries for device use
2. Use a content filter that's separate from SafeSearch, such as Circle or Net Nanny
3. Monitor your child's online activity regularly
4. Limit the amount of personal information your child shares online
5. Be aware of the apps your child is using and the data they're sharing

Final thoughts

While SafeSearch is a helpful addition to Google Family Link, it's not a magic bullet for online safety. As a parent, it's your responsibility to take proactive steps to protect your child from explicit or harmful content online.

By educating yourself about the potential dangers and taking steps to prevent them, you can ensure your child stays safe online. Don't wait until it's too late - take action today.

Create your child's Google account. Enter your credit card information to complete the process.

 

Download the Family Link app to the child's device and sign in with the child's account credentials. You'll receive a notification on your device that your child's device is linked.

Family Link controls also extend to Chromebooks. When a parent sets up a Chromebook with their child’s Family Link-managed Google account, they can add a school account for their child, enabling their children to use school apps under parent supervision.
 

The information also includes the maturity rating, based on the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) content ratings. Apps with a G rating are safer than those with an E rating, which are for kids ages 6 and older. A T rating is for ages 13 and up.

 

You can approve or deny any app that doesn't meet your standards. For any app you approve, you can disable in-app purchases.

##   Use Google Family Link to Know Where Your Kids Are  
 

With Google's location analytics, you have the added security of knowing where your child is as long as they're using their device.

 
These features function even if the child's device is not connected to the internet.
 

In addition to giving you parental control over your child's screen time, Family Link keeps tabs on where their device is located, and, based on whether the activity log shows if your child is on the device, where they are. This feature is optional.

 
##   Control and Monitor Chrome Browsing Activity  
 

Parents can use Family Link to set restrictions on how children browse the web. Controls include filters for mature websites, although Google acknowledges that some offensive sites may get through. You can also block and allow specific sites. Kids can ask for permission to visit a site on the block list, and you can approve or deny access through Google Family Link.

 

On the Family Link app, go to Settings > Manage settings > Filters on Google Chrome > Manage sites > Approved or Blocked.

 

Adults can also see and delete a child's Chrome history. To view the child's history, use the child's device to open Chrome. Select the More menu (three vertical dots) then choose History.

 
Google does not block ads, and ads are seen by children when using Family Link.
 

To delete the Chrome history and data, open the Family Link app. Go to Settings > Manage settings > Filters on Google Chrome > Chrome Dashboard. In the History section, tap Clear history.

 
##   Review Your Child's Digital Footprint  
 

If you want to know how much time your child spends online and what apps are their favorites, find the answer in Family Link. Family Link keeps a log of where your child spends their digital time. Weekly and monthly reports let you see which apps were accessed, how long apps were used, and the device's location.

 
##   Support Your Child's Screen Time with Nutritious Apps  
 

Google harnessed the help of teachers to create a curated list of apps with educational value. These apps meet the Google Designed for Families (DFF) program requirements, and are valued by teachers for the ability to ensure time spent on devices is time well spent.

 
##   What Happens When Your Child Turns 13?  
 

On a child's 13th birthday, they can graduate to a full-fledged adult Google account, with all the access you have to apps, websites, videos, and games. Google sends parents an email informing them that their child can take control of their account on their birthday. After that, the parent can no longer manage their child's account.
