One of the most anticipated games of this year is Halo Infinite, which will be the launch title for Xbox Series X, the next-gen console of Microsoft. We have hardly had any news about this game, but luckily, 343 Industries has recently confirmed that we will see more about this title, which is still in development, in the upcoming Xbox 20/20 event scheduled for July.
 
Despite the fact that it was safe to guess that Halo Infinite would have some type of presentation during the last Inside Xbox livestream, but there was no official confirmation in the same event. However, this will soon change because the developers of 343 Industries have confirmed the arrival of this game at the July event.
 
According to a publication on the official blog of Halo Waypoint, we will soon see more about the launch title of Xbox Series X in the upcoming Inside Xbox event: “You may have seen people talking about this lightly before, but we’re extremely excited to confirm that Halo Infinite will be one of many first-party titles included in the Xbox 20/20 event in July. Get ready.”
 
But, in any case, whether we will see some kind of gameplay of the title or just a new trailer, it is still unknown at the moment. The first Xbox 20/20 event did not meet expectations of fans, so if any kind of gameplay will be shown it would be surely welcomed more by the Xbox community. We would also like to mention that no specific date for the July Inside Xbox has been given, but it will be announced soon in the coming week.
 
Recall that Microsoft has confirmed that Halo Infinite will release on Xbox One, PC, and Xbox Series X. It will come on the same day when the new Microsoft console will be available in the Holiday 2020 season. In recent news, we would like to remind you that Halo 2 is now available on PC.
