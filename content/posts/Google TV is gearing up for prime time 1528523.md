The world of entertainment is about to undergo a significant transformation with the announcement of the new Google TV. This revolutionary product promises to bring a whole new level of entertainment to our living rooms, offering users an unparalleled viewing experience that is sure to change the way we watch TV forever.

So what exactly is Google TV? At its core, Google TV is a new streaming platform that has been designed from the ground up to offer users the ultimate viewing experience. It combines live TV, on-demand streaming services, and even your own personal media library in one easy-to-use interface, giving users instant access to their favorite entertainment at the touch of a button.

But that's just the beginning. Google TV is also packed with innovative features that take the viewing experience to a whole new level. For starters, users will be able to search for content using their voice, making it incredibly easy to find what you want to watch. In addition, Google TV will also offer personalized recommendations, making it easier than ever before to discover new shows and movies that you might enjoy.

But perhaps the most exciting aspect of Google TV is its ability to integrate with other Google products. For example, users will be able to ask Google Assistant to play something on their TV, control playback with their voice, or even use their smartphone as a remote control. This level of integration is unprecedented in the world of entertainment and promises to usher in a new era of accessibility and convenience.

Of course, none of this would be possible without a strong and robust content library, and Google TV does not disappoint. The platform features a massive selection of on-demand movies and TV shows, including popular titles from Netflix, Disney+, and many more. There is also a range of live TV options available, including local and international channels, making it easy to keep up with the latest news, sports, and events.

But perhaps the most significant impact of Google TV won't be felt by individual users, but rather the entertainment industry as a whole. By bringing all these features and innovations together in one product, Google TV is set to disrupt the traditional TV-cable industry significantly. By allowing users to customize their TV experience, broadcasters may need to re-think their programming model and shift to more on-demand and personalized programming options.

In conclusion, the announcement of Google TV is truly revolutionary and is set to shake up the entertainment world in ways that we can't even imagine. By offering an unparalleled viewing experience, innovative features, and seamless integration with other Google products, Google TV is poised to become the future of home entertainment. So get ready for the future and see for yourself what the buzz is all about!

If you have not heard, Google TV it is a new way to combine TV and Web in one screen with a seamless entertainment experience.
 
Google TV was announced about five month ago, ever since we did not know much about it. But now, it seems that Google TV is gearing up and coming to a reality.
 
Here is a preview video of how you could interact with Google TV apps, and services that you may be able to access. The user interface that it is shown in the video is pretty slick; it seems that is pretty smooth and responsive.
 

 
One of Google TV goals is that by using Chrome, the content creators, programmers, developers and advertisers will be able to bring you easy access to the entire internet content; like watch your favorite web videos, play Flash games, view photos, read movie reviews or chat with friends and more.
 
On the web content side, Google is working with some leading technology and media companies to improve Google TV content: The New York Times and USA Today; music sites like VEVO, Pandora and Napster; information networks like Twitter; and online networks like blip.tv and Youtube Leanback.
 
Google also has launched http://google.com/tv, to show off the features and apps in Google TV. One aspect that I think worth to mention is that Google TV is going to have some leverage over others media center products with the ability to integrate Google TV with your satellite TV — this is going to make a lot of people happy –. Of course, besides all the other features and apps!
