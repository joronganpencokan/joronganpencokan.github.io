# You Won't Believe the Secret to Unlocking Treasure Chests in God of War Ragnarok - Say Goodbye to Brambles Forever!

Are you tired of being thwarted by annoying brambles that block your path to treasure chests in God of War Ragnarok? Do you long for a simpler solution that doesn't involve running around in circles trying to find a way to open them? Well, you're in luck, because we've discovered the secret to unlocking those pesky chests - and it's easier than you might think.

First, let's review. In God of War Ragnarok, there are several types of chests scattered throughout the game world. Some of them can be opened easily, by simply pressing the interact button when you're near them. Others, however, are blocked by brambles - those prickly bushes that seem to be everywhere in Midgar.

Until now, most players have approached these brambles with frustration and annoyance. They search for a way to clear them, hoping to find a hidden path or lever that will magically open the chest. But the truth is, there's a much simpler solution - one that doesn't involve any complex puzzles or hidden paths.

All you need to do to unlock chests blocked by brambles in God of War Ragnarok is simple: destroy the brambles with your weapon. Yes, that's right - just bash those thorny bushes with your axe, Blades of Chaos, or any other weapon you happen to be wielding. It's really that easy.

Of course, you might be thinking, "But won't that damage my weapon?" The answer is no - your weapons are designed to withstand a lot of punishment, and chopping through brambles won't cause any permanent damage. And besides, isn't finding treasure more important than preserving your equipment?

So there you have it - the secret to unlocking treasure chests in God of War Ragnarok is simply to destroy the brambles in your path. Don't waste time searching for hidden levers or trying to find the hidden path - just take out your frustration on those prickly bushes and reap the rewards that lie within.

As you continue your journey through the game world, keep this simple tip in mind. It might save you a lot of time and trouble - and who knows, you might even discover some secrets you never would have found otherwise. Good luck, adventurer - and happy treasure hunting!

## How to clear Brambles to open Chests in GoW Ragnarok
 

 
On multiple occasions, you will be playing as Atreus in this game. At that time, you won’t have any Blades of Chaos to burn down the Brambles. Well, don’t worry because you will still be able to remove those brambles and move further in GoW Ragnarok. All you need is some Sigil Arrows in your Quiver. Simply, shoot 3 Sigil Arrows close to each other so they get chained up. When chained perfectly, the area surrounding the Arrows will get bigger and shine brighter. Further, look for some flames nearby, as the Sigils detonate when in contact with the flames. The fire of the detonation will eventually reach the bramble and they’ll be removed.
 
Apart from this, there are some instances in GoW Ragnarok wherein Blades of Chaos will be unable to reach the brambles. In such cases, place the Sigils on an object or bramble so that they get chained up. After that, use the Blades of Chaos to hit any part of the area covered by Sigil magic. This will also cause them to detonate and burn the brambles or thorny branches nearby. You can use either Atreus or Freya’s Sigils Arrows to remove the brambles to open the chests in GoW Ragnarok.
 
That’s all you can do in order to remove the brambles and open chests in God of War Ragnarok. If you found this article helpful, then make sure to check out our GoW Ragnarok Wiki for more in-depth information related to the game.
