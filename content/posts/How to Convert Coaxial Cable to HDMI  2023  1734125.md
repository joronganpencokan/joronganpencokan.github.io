### Coaxial Cable
 
Invented in the 19th century, Coaxial cable was used to carry out radio signals. It has a three-layer architecture. Coax cables are made up of a copper core and two-layer insulation above that. It was meant to transfer analog signals with a minimum of hindrance or interception. Coax cables were extensively used in radios, telegraphs, and televisions. It has now been replaced by fiber and other technologies that promise faster transmission.
 
Coax cables are prone to data/signal loss over distance. Fiber technology is faster and more reliable than Coax but requires more investment. Coaxial cables require minimum investment and maintenance.
 
### HDMI Cable
 
HDMI stands for High Definition Multimedia Interface. It was invented in Japan by the Japanese TV manufacturers and is the most popular replacement for the coax cable at homes. It carries out signals among devices with a colossal amount of data and broadcasts signals at high definition or ultra-high definition interface. It carries audio too.
 
HDMI is a digital cable. It is void of any data losses. It carries more data than coaxial cable and can deliver signals at a much faster speed. It performs digital transmission and is hence void of any interference or hindrance. Nowadays, every TV, broadband, and other cable device comprises HDMI ports instead of coaxial ports.
 
### 2 Ways to Convert Coaxial cable to HDMI
 
There are some methods by which you can convert your Coaxial cable to HDMI or vice-versa. You may require upgraded equipment to get things right. Now, let us hop right into the methods we can follow:

The easiest way to solve this problem is to get your set-top box or cable box replaced. Your set-top box not supporting HDMI is an indication that you’re using a way too old box. Now is the time to replace and get an HDMI supporting set-top box.

#### 2. Buy a Coax to HDMI converter

- Connect one end of the Coax to your cable box Coax Out port. Take the other end and connect it to the converter labelled as Coax In
 - Now take the HDMI cable to connect to the device and converter the same as you did with coax cable.
 - Now you need to turn on the device to test the installed connection.

 
Now that you’ve connected the converter and other necessary cables and switched on your device, your device must start receiving signals. If it does not appear in the few minutes, then consider selecting the input method as HDMI-2.
 
This method is very easy. You only need to invest some money in buying the signal converter, that’s it. Post that, the conversion is just a matter of minutes. Now that you’ve connected the converter and other necessary cables, you need to switch your device on and select the input method as HDMI.
