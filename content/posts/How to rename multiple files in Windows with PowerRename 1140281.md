Are you tired of renaming files one by one in Windows? No more worries, you can now rename tons of Windows files in just one click! An effective solution for saving time and maximizing your productivity. Read on to unlock this ultimate time-saving trick.

Step 1: Select the Files You Want to Rename

The first step is to select the files you want to rename. Use the Ctrl or Shift key to select multiple files at once. You can select a range of files, or just individual ones, depending on your needs.

Step 2: Right-Click and Select Rename

Once you have all your files selected, right-click on any file and select the “Rename” option from the context menu. Alternatively, you can press F2 on the keyboard to access the rename function.

Step 3: Rename Your Files all at Once

This feature will allow you to simultaneously rename all your selected files at once. All you need to do is to input the new file name, and Windows will automatically number the files sequentially. You can use other characters such as underscores or spaces, but it’s worth noting that some file systems may not support certain characters, so be cautious and use only safe characters.

In addition to sequential numbering, you can also replace some of the characters in your file names. For example, if you have multiple files with the word "image" at the beginning of the file name, you could simply replace it with something more specific for your project. The possibilities are endless, and with this tip, you can save a lot of time renaming files.

Step 4: Access Advanced Rename Options

You can also access advanced renaming options such as adding prefixes or suffixes, custom naming conventions, and much more. To use these options, you will need to access the Bulk Rename Utility.

The Bulk Rename Utility is a powerful tool that can help you easily rename mass quantities of files. With the utility, you can apply many different renaming options to your files, such as adding dates and times, numerical sequences, and more.

Step 5: Save Your Changes and Enjoy the Time Saving Benefits

Finally, click “yes” to apply the renaming changes, and voila! You can now enjoy the time-saving benefits of this quick trick. Your files will be renamed in just a few seconds. This is an ideal solution if you have a ton of files to rename, and you want to streamline the process for maximum productivity.

In conclusion, renaming tons of Windows files is no longer a tedious task, thanks to the power of technology. By using the right tools, you can make quick work of even the most daunting renaming tasks, so you can get more done in less time. With this simple trick, you can start reclaiming your productivity and get back to what you do best: creating and producing great content.

Accessible from the right-click context menu in File Explorer, the PowerRename command can rename files through the use of variables. Simply select the files you wish to rename, trigger the command, and then choose the filename string and variables that you want to use.
If you just need to add sequential numbers to a group of files, that's already easy enough to do directly in Windows. Open File Explorer, select the files you want to rename, and then press F2. The last file in the list is selected. Type the name you wish to use and press Enter. All the files you selected are given the same name with successive numbers in parentheses.
But PowerRename can do that and more. If you don't already have PowerToys on your PC, download and install the PowerToysSetup.exe file from the program's GitHub page. PowerToys and its programs work the same in both Windows 10 and 11.

## How to rename multiple files in Windows with PowerRename


If you need more powerful and flexible file renaming, then you might prefer a third-party utility. I've used Sherrod Computer's File Renamer program, which comes in both free and paid flavors, and provides a variety of renaming options. But if your file renaming needs are relatively basic, PowerRename is a useful and convenient tool.
To see the last strings used for a search and replace, turn on the switch for Show recently used strings. Finally, if you think you'll need more than just the regular expressions used for search and replace, turn on the switch for Use Boost library. Otherwise, leave this off; you can always turn it on if and when necessary.
In the right pane, confirm the files you wish to rename and make sure each one is checked. 
The files initially all had names of IMG_ followed by a four-digit number and then JPG as the extension, e.g., IMG_1001, IMG_1002, etc. In the Search field, I typed IMG_. In PowerRename, the . symbol is used as a variable representing a single character. So I then typed four dots after the IMG_ as in IMG_.... and then nothing for the extension as I wanted to leave JPG as is.
With PowerRename variables, the month is represented by the letter M, the date by the letter D, and the year by the letter Y. The number of times you use the letter determines the exact format. In this case, I wanted to use the two-digit value for the month, the two-digit value for the date, and the four-digit value for the year. So, I typed the replace string as Trip to London-$MM-$DD-$YYYY.
