Requiem Revengeance is supposed to be an unlockable Legendary Stance you can get as you play the Campaign. But many players are unable to obtain it even after completing the game. Well, the truth is that you cannot unlock it in Halo Infinite. In the game, it says that you can unlock it in the Campaign. But after going through all of the Mjolnir Armory Lockers it doesn’t seem like it.
 
It created concern that players even after completing the game are unable to unlock this Legendary Stance. The players started asking 343 Industries as to why this is happening on their Twitter & on Waypoint. 343 Industries said that this is a bug that occurs for those who play the Campaign offline. So until the bug fix is implemented in Halo Infinite, you cannot get Requiem Revengeance in Halo Infinite. You will be able to see it in the cosmetics section that is about it. Don’t worry as the next patch drops you will be able to get the Legendary Stance. That is if 343 Industries deems it a necessary fix. in the meantime follow and keep a track of any updates through Twitter and Waypoint.
