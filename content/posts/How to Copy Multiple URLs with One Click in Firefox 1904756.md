If you use the Web for intensive research, you might have found yourself opening and copying links one at a time when you want to include them as references. Fortunately, a Firefox add-on called Easy Copy offers a quick way to copy web page URLs along with other details like page title and HTML source.
 
You will need to restart after installing the add-on.
 
EasyCopy uses the context menu for copying, so you’ll need to right-click on the mouse button and look for EasyCopy in the list.
 

 
You will then see a list of what information to copy from the current web page.
 
- Title Link – A hyperlinked page title in HTML format

 
Example: <a href=”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll”>Rock and roll</a>
 
- URL – the website address of the page

 
Example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll
 
- Title – the page title without any links

 
Example: Rock and roll
 
- Title link and selection – a hyperlinked page title followed by selected text

 
Example: <a href=”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll”>Rock and roll</a> – The term “rock and roll” now has at least two different meanings, both in common usage: referring to the first wave of music that originated in the US in the 1950s and would later develop into the more encompassing international style known as “rock music.”
 
- BBCode/Forum link – a link format used in forums

 
Example: [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll]Rock and roll[/url]
 
- Wikilink – a simplified link format for wiki environments such as Wikipedia

 
Example: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll Rock and roll]
 
- HTML source – the HTML code used by the entire page
 - Links on page (text) – a list of all links on the page in text format

 
Example:
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fats_Domino
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Richard
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Lee_Lewis
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Vincent
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybellene
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion_(music)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtone
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_amplifier
 
- Links on page (HTML) – a list of all links on the page in HTML format

 
<a href=”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_88″>Rocket 88</a><br>
<a href=”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Brenston”>Jackie Brenston</a><br>
<a href=”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ike_Turner”>Ike Turner</a><br>
<a href=”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_of_Rhythm”>The Kings of Rhythm</a><br>
<a href=”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Phillips”>Sam Phillips</a><br>
<a href=”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Records”>Sun Records</a><br>
 
If you want to copy only from a single page, then you need to make sure you choose from the EasyCopy section in the context menu.
 
On the other hand, if you want to copy the same type of link or title from all open tabs, then select “Copy all tabs” from the same menu. The list of copy options remain the same, except it will perform the function for all tabs within the browser.
 
In the example below, I copied the URLs of all three tabs entitled “Rock n roll,” “Blues” and “Jazz.”
 
Here’s what the pasted information looked like:
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz
 
The default setup of EasyCopy’s context menu includes a shortcut for copying a page’s title link, but you can add more shortcuts by going to the add-on’s Options section.
 
From the context menu, select Options.
 
Click the link/text type you want to add as a shortcut and check the box next to “Show In Main Menu,” then click “OK.” You should now see the option right in the main context menu.
 
EasyCopy has a lot of useful features, and it’s one of the most versatile link copiers I’ve seen on a browser add-on by far. It cuts down on a lot of clicks, giving your hand that much needed rest, and letting you work faster than ever.
