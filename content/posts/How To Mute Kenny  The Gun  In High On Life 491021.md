If you're like most people who watch the High on Life vlog, you're probably familiar with Kenny the Gun's voice. For some, it's endearing and entertaining, but for others, it's just plain annoying. Luckily, there's a simple hack you can use to say goodbye to Kenny's voice, and it's easier than you might think.

Before we get into the hack itself, let's talk about why Kenny's voice might be irritating to certain viewers. For starters, his accent, which is a unique blend of Canadian and Hong Kongese, can be difficult to understand at times. Additionally, his mannerisms and vocal inflections can come across as forced or grating to some.

But fear not, there is a solution. The key to muting Kenny's voice is to turn on closed captions while watching High on Life. Closed captions, also known as subtitles, are a feature on most streaming services and video platforms that display the dialogue and sound effects of a video on-screen in text form.

By turning on closed captions while watching High on Life, you'll be able to follow along with the vlog without having to listen to Kenny's voice. Instead, you can simply read the captions as they appear on-screen. This not only solves the problem of Kenny's voice being annoying, but it can also make it easier to understand what's happening in the vlog, particularly if you're not a native English speaker.

To turn on closed captions while watching High on Life, simply look for the CC icon on the video player. This might be located in a menu or settings section of the player, depending on where you're watching the vlog. Once you've located the CC icon, click or tap it to turn on closed captions.

From there, you should be able to see the captions on-screen as they appear, allowing you to follow along with the vlog without having to hear Kenny's voice. If you find that the captions are hard to read or inadequate, you can usually adjust the font size or styling in the caption settings.

So there you have it, a simple hack that allows you to say goodbye to Kenny the Gun's annoying voice on High on Life. By turning on closed captions, you can enjoy the vlog without being distracted or irritated by his unique vocal style. Give it a try and see how much smoother your viewing experience can be.
