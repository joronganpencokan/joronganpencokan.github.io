# Unveiling the Secret Formula to Maximize Your Influence over Every Human Being on this Planet!

Do you want to become a powerful influencer and make an impact on the world? Are you looking for a secret formula to maximize your influence over every human being on this planet?

Well, you're in luck because in this article, we will unveil the secret formula that has been used by some of the most influential leaders in the world to achieve great success.

Before we dive into the formula, let's define influence. Influence is the ability to persuade or inspire people to take action, change their behavior, or adopt a new mindset. Influencers have the power to change the world by influencing the thoughts and actions of others.

Now, let's get to the secret formula that will help you maximize your influence:

### 1. Build Trust

Trust is the foundation of influence. If people don't trust you, they won't follow you. To build trust, you need to be honest, transparent, and authentic. You also need to be reliable and consistent in your words and actions.

### 2. Create Value

Influencers are value creators. They provide value to their audience by sharing knowledge, insights, and experiences. To create value, you need to be an expert in your field and have a deep understanding of your audience's needs and desires.

### 3. Tell Stories

Stories have the power to inspire and connect with people on an emotional level. Use storytelling to communicate your message and make it memorable. Share your own story or use examples that your audience can relate to.

### 4. Build Relationships

Influencers understand the importance of relationships. Build meaningful connections with your audience by engaging with them on a personal level. Respond to comments, ask for feedback, and create a sense of community.

### 5. Be Consistent

Consistency is key to building influence. Be consistent in your message, content, and actions. People want to know what to expect from you, and consistency builds trust and credibility.

### 6. Be Passionate

Passion is contagious. Let your passion for your message and your audience shine through in everything you do. Your enthusiasm will inspire others and help you maximize your influence.

### 7. Be Patient

Influencers don't become influential overnight. It takes time and patience to build a following and make an impact. Trust the process and stay focused on your mission.

By following this simple formula, you can maximize your influence over every human being on this planet. Remember, influence is about building trust, providing value, telling stories, building relationships, being consistent, being passionate, and being patient.

Humankind has “Influence” as a factor whose impact is of paramount importance in-game. To generate influence, players need to strategize correctly and shrewdly. As is the objective in Humankind, expanding territories requires resources. Of these resources, influence really determines a whole lot of what a player can accomplish in Humankind. Unlike what we understand influence to be, in the game- it is used as currency. Players can use this to expand their territorial occupancies. In addition to territorial expansion, you can spend your influence stars to enact “civic policy”. In order to assist you, we’ve listed ways by which you can increase your influence in Humankind. Follow the steps below for the same.
 
## How to Increase Influence in Humankind?
 

 
Here’s how to increase influence in both the Neolithic era and post Ancient era, in Humankind:
 
- In the Neolithic era, the map highlights points of “Curiosity” to which you can send units to investigate.
 - If you investigate the area and it reveals Ancient encampments- they yield 5 influence points.
 - Hunt animals to earn additional influence points– the more dangerous the animal, the greater the yield of influence points.
 - Post the neolithic era, the ways to earn influence points depend on your population and its stability in your empire.
 - For these population and stability attributes, you’ll need to build cities.
 - The higher the stability- the more influence points you’ll generate.
 - The stabilities from 0-29% yield no influence, from 30%-90% it yields +1 influence and for 91% to 100% you get +2 influence.
 - In Addition to population stability, Emblematic districts and select infrastructures also contribute to your influence count.
 - Also, be sure to check your “Commons Quarter” and “Tenets” for influence star yields.
 - The important part here is to strategize your city builds and focus on the resource yields you need.

 
In addition to “Influence” which is present in-game as a resource represented by violet stars, there exists another in-game concept called “Sphere of Influence”. It’s important to keep in mind that these two though similar in sound, act for two independent occurrences in-game and shouldn’t be confused with each other.
 
That’s pretty much it! Even though this concept may seem a bit difficult to grasp at first in-game, you’ll understand it better as you play the game. If you liked this guide, be sure to check out our other tips and tricks and in-game guides for Humankind!
