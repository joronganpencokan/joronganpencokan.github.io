Title: Master the Art of Domination: Tips on How to Skyrocket Your Kill Death Ratio in Pubg Mobile Season 13!

Introduction:

PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, popularly known as PUBG, is one of the most played battle royale games worldwide. With an increasing player base, PUBG Mobile Season 13 has raised the level of competition to a whole new level.

The PUBG Mobile Season 13 has come up with new challenges, exciting rewards, and powerful weapons. To survive and thrive in the game, you need to master the art of domination, which involves a high kill death ratio.

In this article, we will offer you some expert tips on how to skyrocket your kill death ratio in PUBG Mobile Season 13.

Body:

1. Choose Your Drop Location Wisely:

The first and foremost thing you need to do is to choose your drop location wisely. Every map in PUBG has a unique feature, and you need to know them well. Choosing a crowded place like Pochinki, School, or Bootcamp may fetch you more loot, but it also increases the risk of quick elimination.

Land on a less busy location with decent looting opportunities, and as the circle progresses, move to the middle of the circle. It will lower the chances of getting caught between enemies and increase the chances of getting more kills.

2. Build A Good Load Out:

The weapon's damage and range differ, so it's important to have a good balance of close and long-range weaponry. Always pick up guns with good ammunition as you don't want to run out of bullets in the middle of a fight. 

Equip yourself with grenades, smoke bombs, and first aid kits as they will come in handy during intense fights. Make sure to prioritize finding armor and helmets to give yourself an edge in battles.

3. Practice Better Communication:

Communication is key, especially when playing with a team. Use the voice chat option to communicate with your team about enemies' positions, loot locations, or other important information. Update your team about your movements and plan your strategy collaboratively.

4. Play Smart:

You won't become a better PUBG player if you just run and gun. It would help if you played smart by positioning yourself in the right locations and anticipating enemies' movements. Use the environment to your advantage by taking cover or hiding in foliage. 

Always keep an eye out for the shrinking circle and move accordingly. Use vehicles to get around the map more quickly, but don't over-rely on them as it could attract unwanted attention.

5. Practice Makes Perfect:

Last but not least, practice is crucial in PUBG. Whether it's solo or squad, it's essential to spend time honing your skills. Take part in training modes and arcade modes to practice different strategies and improve your shooting.

Conclusion:

PUBG Mobile Season 13 offers a challenging and rewarding experience to all players. But to succeed, you need to master the art of domination, which translates to a high kill death ratio. By following the tips we've provided, you'll be well on your way to improving your PUBG skills and enjoying the game even more. Good luck and see you on the battlegrounds!

In Season 13, players were introduced to a new kill death ratio system as a badge of honor wherein players could show off their skills to others. Want to get a good kill death ratio in PUBG? Don’t worry. This guide will show you how to increase your KD in PUBG Mobile easily.
 
## How To Improve K/D Ratio in PUBG Mobile
 
Let’s take a look at how the introduction of the new Kill-Death ratio has changed the way PUBG is played. It definitely calls for new strategies and styles which might be favorable to some types of players and unfavorable to some. This change is basically PUBG’s attempt at bringing more balance to the game and remove some benefits to certain type of players.
 
### What is KD Ratio in PUBG Mobile?
 
Before, the Kill-Death ratio in PUBG was based on the kills you have to the deaths you experience. The loophole here was that players could simply focus on surviving and camping while getting a few kills here and there. The aggression of a fight could almost be eliminated from the game.
 
But now, things are different. Now the ratio totally depends on the kills you get in PUBG. It doesn’t matter if you lived until the very end or not. The ratio now focuses on the total kills and the total number of matches that you have played. So, without further ado, here are some useful tips on how to increase your kill death ratio in PUBG.
 
### Try to get maximum kills
 
Focus on the kills you get in every match. If you got 5 kills in one match and only 2 in the next one, your KD is bound to decrease. Try to get your kills during the earlier part of the game to be on the safer side. Kill bots whenever there is a chance because killing them will also increase your kill death ratio in PUBG. Of course, focus on surviving too. Dying quickly without any kills is not an option because your KD ratio will suffer.
 
### Choose the best locations to drop
 
Make the right decisions to drop in areas where you won’t be killed instantly. If you decide on hotspots where high-level players are present, chances are that you won’t survive for long. To consciously increase your KD ratio, you must make a proper strategy before heading into battle. If you simply land on the hotspots and rush to get kills, you might not get enough time to even make a strategy. So it’s better if you land on the safer spots and then gradually move on to other areas.
 
### Play with people you know
 
When you play with your friends, you can plan out your progression and tactics. You can depend on them to follow the strategy as you go, which cannot be said about random strangers on the internet. Talk to each other about the aggressive strategy that you will follow during the game and there’s a high chance that it will be successful due to your team’s coordination.
 
### Try to get powerful weapons
 
With more powerful weapons, it becomes much easier to maximize kills thereby supporting your end goal of increasing KD. Use sniper rifles to finish off someone at a distance and use machine guns to go on a killing spree. Whatever you do, make sure to keep the kill count as a priority.
 
So this is how you can increase kill-death ratio in PUBG. For more informative PUBG tips and tricks, check out our PUBG Mobile guides right away.
