# You Won't Believe the Insane Amount of Disguises Available in Hitman 3's Mendoza Level - Check Out This List of All 15 Chameleons Now!

The Mendoza level in Hitman 3 is one of the most exciting and diverse levels in the game. Located in Argentina's wine country, it offers an immersive experience with various wineries, vineyards, and luxurious mansions. The level also presents a broad range of disguises, giving players an advantage in completing their mission. In this article, we'll run through all 15 chameleons available in Mendoza and explore how they can help Agent 47 in the game.

1. Waiter: The first and most straightforward disguise available is a waiter. By masquerading as a waiter, you can blend in with the other serving staff and move unnoticed throughout the premises. Useful for serving poison to your target.

2. Winery Staff: As the primary workforce involved in the wine-making process, disguising as a winery staff member offers superb access. You can access various areas, including the wine cellars, crushing rooms, and fermentation chambers.

3. Delivery Man: When you wear the suit of the package carrier, you can gain permission to access packages and different items as part of your routine delivery tasks.

4. Bodyguard: This is an essential disguise that can help you move around seamlessly when you want to get close to your target. It's a powerful disguise, and it can come in handy when you need to escort other NPCs.

5. Mansion Guard: Disguising as the mansion guard in Hitman 3's Mendoza level offers a great way to blend in with the security details. You can deploy security cameras and access restricted areas.

6. Waiter (Catering): A more formal waiter attire that enables access to various indoor zones for your undercover objectives. 

7. Kitchen Staff: As a chef, you can go behind the scenes and operate within the restaurant's kitchen. You have the power to contaminate food and manipulate the kitchen's cooking mechanisms to carry out your secret mission undetected.

8. Bartender: With the ability to mix different drinks, you can make a lethal cocktail that would cause severe complications to your target. You can also blend securely with other bar staff while providing drinks to your temporary visitors and patrons.

9. Producer: Wearing this disguise makes you a direct participant in the winemaking process, and you can have access to samples of wine that can aid in your mission. You can even participate in tastings and manipulate wine contents.

10. Tech Crew: Becoming a part of the production crew grants access to backstage areas and enhances mobility while working on production equipment and instruments.

11. Wine Tour Guide: This disguise grants access to multiple areas within the winery and a command of leading guests on adventurous wine tours. Take particular note when you initiate new members' involvement and use them as potential pawns to execute your assigned tasks.

12. Waiter (Private Dining): Ideal for private occasions held within the mansion, this disguise allows you to access restricted areas within the mansion's indoor settings. You can make indirect kill attempts with this attire.

13. Bodyguard (Red Dragon): The Red Dragon is a prominent local syndicate in the area, and they are dangerously heavily armed. Disguising as a member of the Red Dragon bodyguard team grants access to sealed areas and improves mobility within the environment.

14. Wine Shop Assistant: When you wear the wine shop's staff disguise, you can entice customers to purchase stock and build customer relationships. It's a relative disguise that doesn't offer significant access to improvements, but it's worth having.

15. Winery Owner: This one is the most tricky, as it requires proper planning to achieve. To obtain this disguise, you need to take out the winery owner and wear his clothes. It grants access to restricted office areas and control of winery resources.

In conclusion, navigating through Hitman 3's Mendoza level will be a lot easier with any of these disguises. As you progress through the level, experiment with the disguises and see how they can aid you in achieving your unique mission goals.
