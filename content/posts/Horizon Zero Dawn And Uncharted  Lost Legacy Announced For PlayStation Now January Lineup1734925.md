As the new year starts, it's time for gamers to jump into the world of Playstation Now, as the January lineup includes two of the most popular games of all time. We're talking about the open-world action-RPG, Horizon Zero Dawn, and the thrilling, action-packed adventure game, Uncharted: Lost Legacy.

For those who have not played these games before, let's give you a quick rundown of each game.

Horizon Zero Dawn is a game that transports you to a post-apocalyptic world where robotic creatures roam the land. You play as Aloy, a skilled hunter who sets out on a quest to uncover the secrets of the past and take on the mechanical beasts. The game boasts of gorgeous visuals, gripping storytelling, and non-stop action that will keep you hooked for hours.

On the other hand, Uncharted: Lost Legacy is a spin-off from the popular Uncharted series. This game puts you in control of two badass female characters - Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross. Together, they embark on an adventure to find the lost Tusk of Ganesha in the mountains of India. The game provides an immersive gameplay experience, filled with high-octane action sequences, breathtaking visuals, and an engaging storyline.

Both games are critically acclaimed and have won several awards over the years. They are a must-play for any Playstation gamer, and being part of the January lineup couldn't have been any better.

Playstation Now is a cloud-based gaming service that allows players to access a vast library of games, including PS4 games that can be streamed directly to your Playstation console, PC, or other supported devices.
