REVEALED: Top 5 Clever Tricks To Find Out If Your Crush Is Using Facebook Dating!

Introduction:

Facebook Dating is a new feature that Facebook rolled out in September 2019 in the United States, and it has since spread to other countries. The feature is designed to connect people who share similar interests, whether it's dating or just making new friends. 

However, not everyone is comfortable sharing their dating life on Facebook, especially if they have a crush on someone they know. If you're in this situation, you may be wondering if your crush is using Facebook Dating. Fortunately, there are a few clever tricks you can use to find out!

Trick 1: Check if Facebook Dating is Available in Their Country

The first step to finding out if your crush is using Facebook Dating is to check if the feature is available in their country. Facebook Dating is not yet available in all countries, so this will give you an idea of whether it's even possible for them to be using the feature.

To check if Facebook Dating is available in a specific country, go to the Facebook app and tap on the three horizontal lines in the top right corner. Scroll down and tap on the "Dating" option. If Facebook Dating is available in that country, you will see a "Get Started" button. If it's not available, you'll see a message stating it's not currently available in their country.

Trick 2: Look for Facebook Dating in their Interests

If your crush has added Facebook Dating to their interests, it's a clear sign that they're using the feature. To check if Facebook Dating is among their interests, simply go to their Facebook profile and look under the "About" section. Scroll down to the "Interests" section and see if Facebook Dating is listed there.

Trick 3: Check their Recent Activity

If your crush has been using Facebook Dating recently, their activity might show up on their Facebook profile. To check this, go to their profile and click on the three dots next to "More." From there, select "Activity Log." In the "Activity Log," select "Filter," and then select "Facebook Dating" from the dropdown menu. This will show you all of their recent Facebook Dating activity.

Trick 4: Ask a Mutual Friend

If you have a mutual friend with your crush, you can ask them if your crush is on Facebook Dating. Your mutual friend may be able to tell you without directly asking your crush.

Trick 5: Create a Fake Facebook Dating Account

This option is a bit trickier and should only be used as a last resort. You can create a fake Facebook Dating account to try and match with your crush. If you do match, you'll know they're also on Facebook Dating. However, this option can be risky if your crush figures out it's a fake account.

Conclusion:

These are the top five clever tricks you can use to find out if your crush is using Facebook Dating. Remember, it's important to respect your crush's privacy and not to invade their personal space. If you do find out they're on Facebook Dating, try to approach the situation calmly and respectfully. Good luck!

### Facebook Dating: How it Works?
 
A regular Facebook account is different from Facebook Dating account in various aspects. Although the app gains access to data from your Fb account, it does not let it impact your dating profile in any manner. For instance, users in your friend list cannot know the whereabouts of your Dating profile.
 
Similarly, your wooing magic in conversations remain separate from the chats on Facebook messenger. The best part is that you can chuck away your Dating profile without hampering with the activities of the main Facebook account.
 
With a Facebook Dating account, you can meet new people and find dates to convert your dreams into reality. Did you find someone interesting? Send them a text or like their profile to get things going. If the other person also likes you back, congrats, it’s a match!
 
However, you will not get notified if someone loses interest in you. In other words, the app cannot tell if someone blocked you on Facebook dating. To know that, you will have to be more attentive about who you are matching with on the app.
 
### Things You Can Do with Facebook Dating
 
Are you new to the dating app and wondering what exactly it does? If so, here are the top 5 things Facebook Dating offers:
 
- You can share Instagram posts or other photos at the bottom of your account.
 - By tapping the heart icon on other Fb Dating user’s profile, you can let them know that you like them. Tap on X to pass the profile and see the next person.
 - If someone else likes your profile you will get a notification. Like their profile back and slide into their DM like a true admirer.
 - You can access all your conversations and matches simply by tapping on the Matches option at the top.
 - Facebook Dating lets you answer random questions to help improve your potential match suggestions.
 - You can link with various upcoming events and groups to find other users with similar interests.
