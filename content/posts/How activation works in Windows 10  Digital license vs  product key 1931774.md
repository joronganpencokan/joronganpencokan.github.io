Introduction

Windows 10 has become the most popular operating system in the world, powering over 1.3 billion PCs, laptops, and other devices. However, one of the biggest questions that users often face is whether to activate their copy of Windows 10 with a digital license or a product key. In this article, we will explore both options and unveil the secrets behind Windows 10 activation.

Digital License Activation

At the heart of Windows 10 activation is the digital license, a new method introduced with Windows 10 that allows Microsoft to validate the authenticity of the operating system without the need for a product key. Digital licenses are tied to the hardware of the computer that Windows 10 is installed on, and are registered with Microsoft servers when activated.

Digital license activation has several advantages over product key activation. Firstly, it eliminates the need for users to keep track of product keys, which can easily get lost or misplaced. Secondly, it allows users to transfer their Windows 10 license between devices, provided that they sign in to their Microsoft account on both devices.

Product Key Activation

Product key activation has been the traditional method for activating Windows operating systems since the days of Windows 95. A product key is a unique 25-character code that is used to activate Windows 10 on a specific device. Product keys can be purchased from Microsoft or authorized resellers, and are usually included with pre-installed versions of Windows 10.

The main advantage of product key activation is that it is a one-time purchase. Once you have purchased a product key, you can use it to activate Windows 10 on the same device as many times as you like, without the need for an internet connection. However, product keys cannot be used to transfer your Windows 10 license between devices.

Which One Should You Choose?

When it comes to the question of digital license vs product key activation, the answer is not clear-cut. It ultimately depends on your needs and preferences, as well as the device that you are using Windows 10 on.

If you frequently switch between devices or upgrade your hardware, digital license activation may be the more convenient option for you. On the other hand, if you are using Windows 10 on a single device and do not plan on upgrading anytime soon, a product key activation may be the more cost-effective option.

Conclusion

In summary, both digital license and product key activation have their respective advantages and disadvantages. It is important to understand the differences between the two and choose the option that best suits your needs. With this knowledge, you can rest assured that your copy of Windows 10 will be fully activated and legally validated.

Over the years, the installation of Windows has gotten easier and more reliable, and Windows 10 is no exception. In this operating system, Microsoft has made it a lot easier for users to upgrade, but to make it all happen, the company has also had to change how the activation process works.
 
According to the Windows 10 activation documentation, the software giant uses the activation technology to verify that a computer is running a genuine copy and that the same license hasn’t been used on more devices than permitted under the terms.
 
Windows 10 also includes a new kind of activation, something the company calls “digital license” (formerly known as “digital entitlement”), which is in addition to the 25-character product key method. The activation the operating system will use will depend on how you have obtained your copy of windows 10.
 
According to Microsoft, “digital license” is the new activation method in Windows 10 that doesn’t require the user to enter a product key. In this case, activation will happen automatically.
 
Windows 10 will use the “digital license” (digital entitlement) activation method if one of the following is true:
 
- You’re upgrading a genuine copy of Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 for free.
 - You’ve purchased a copy of Windows 10 in the Windows Store and successfully activated Windows 10.
 - You’ve purchased a Windows 10 Pro upgrade in the Windows Store and successfully activated Windows 10.
 - You’re part of the Windows Insider Program and have upgraded your genuine activated copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 to the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview build.

 
Windows 10 will use the product key activation method if one of the following is true:
 
- You have obtained a copy of Windows 10 from an authorized retailer.
 - You have obtained a digital copy of Windows 10 from an authorized retailer.
 - You’re using the Volume Licensing agreement for Windows 10 or MSDN subscription.
 - You have purchased a new computer running Windows 10.

 
## Activate Windows 10 after the upgrade
 
If you have upgraded to Windows 10 from a genuine copy of Windows 7 or 8.1, the activation will happen automatically through an internet connection. Also, an online “digital license” (digital entitlement) will be created for your device.
 
According to Microsoft documentation, if your version of Windows is not activated before upgrading to Windows 10, it won’t activate. As such, you must ensure your copy is fully activated before upgrading.
 
Checking your Windows activation is very easy:
 
- Windows 7: Click the Start button, right-click Computer, and click Properties. Then look under Windows activation.
 - Windows 8.1: Go to Control Panel, click System and Security, and click System: Then look under Windows activation.
 - Windows 10: Open the Settings app, click on Update & security, and navigate to Activation.

 
If your copy of Windows 10 isn’t activated, you can get more information on the “Windows 10 activation errors” web page.
 
## Activate Windows 10 after reinstalling
 
If you have activated a free copy or bought and activated a copy of Windows 10 from the Store, you have a “digital license” (digital entitlement) for that device.
 
This means you can reinstall Windows 10, even a clean installation, and you don’t need to enter a product key. Select the Skip option if you’re prompted to enter a product key during the installation. Then the operating system will activate automatically after the installation.
 
If you previously installed and activated Windows 10 using a product key, you’ll need to enter a product key during the installation.
 
## Activate a new Windows 10 installation
 
A product key will be needed to activate Windows 10 when you install the operating system for the first time, and your device never had an activated copy of Windows 10.
 
Of course, you’ll also need a product key if you install Windows 10 Pro on a device with Windows 10 Home running on it.
 
## Activate Windows 10 after hardware change
 
If you make significant hardware changes, such as replacing the motherboard, Windows 10 won’t re-activate. However, you can link your Microsoft Account with your Windows 10 digital license before making the changes, and then you can use the new Activation Troubleshooter tool to re-activate the operating system.
 
Linking your digital license with your account is very straightforward. If you already have a Microsoft Account connected to Windows 10, you’re good to go. If you only have a local account, you need to add a Microsoft Account to Windows 10. Go to Settings > Update & security > Activation, click Add an account and complete the process. 
 
Then you can use the Activation Troubleshooter. Go to Settings > Update & security > Activation, click Troubleshoot, and sign in with your Microsoft Account. Then select your computer your the list of digital licenses associated with your account, check This is the device I’m using right now, and click Activate. You’ll need to contact customer support for assistants if the activation fails.
 
Update October 14, 2015: Microsoft will make it easier to activate Windows 10 with Threshold 2. Starting Windows 10 build 10565, users will be able to use their Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 product keys to do a clean install of Windows 10 without having to do the upgrade first — full details on the changes here.
 
Update June 23, 2016: Starting with Windows 10 build 14371 and moving forward, Microsoft is renaming “digital entitlement” to “digital license.”
 
Update July 9, 2016: On July 29, Microsoft is ending the free offer to upgrade free to Windows 10. Everyone who has upgraded will retain the digital license for the life of the device. If you reinstall Windows 10 with the Anniversary Update, your computer will remain activated.
 
Update July 11, 2022: This guide has been revised to make sure the information is still accurate.
