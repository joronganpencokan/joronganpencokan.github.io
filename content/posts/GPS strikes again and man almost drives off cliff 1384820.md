# Unbelievable! GPS Navigates Man Straight Towards the Edge of a Cliff - You Won't Believe What Happened Next!

GPS technology has revolutionized the way we navigate the world, but sometimes this cutting-edge system can lead us straight into danger.

Recently, a man in Oregon, USA, found himself in a nerve-wracking situation when his GPS led him towards the edge of a cliff. The incident occurred on a sunny afternoon when the man, whose identity remains unknown, was traveling on an isolated road near the coast.

According to reports, the man was following the directions given by his GPS when the road suddenly became narrow and steep. With each turn, the man felt more and more uneasy, but he continued to trust his GPS and followed the directions.

However, his trust in technology quickly came crashing down when his car suddenly stopped at the edge of a cliff. The man was stuck, with no way to turn back or go forward, and with the deep blue sea waiting below, the situation seemed hopeless.

At this point, the man could have panicked or made a rash decision, but he did neither. Instead, he pulled out his phone and called for help. Within minutes, a rescue team arrived on the scene and pulled the man to safety.

As it turned out, the GPS had led the man to the edge of the cliff because the device was not updated with the latest map data. The system had failed to recognize that there was a new roadblock, and the man had paid the price for blindly trusting technology.

Fortunately, the story had a happy ending, and the man was able to leave the scene with only minor injuries. But this incident serves as a cautionary tale about the limitations of GPS technology and the need to exercise common sense while navigating unknown terrain.

In conclusion, while GPS technology can be a lifesaver, it is not without its limitations and potential pitfalls. Rather than blindly trusting our devices, we must remain vigilant and always back them up with our own knowledge and intuition. Only then can we stay safe and avoid potentially dangerous situations like the one faced by the man in Oregon.

How GPS can make you drive off a cliff!
 
Technology is doing exactly what all of us have, at least on occasion, dreamed of doing. That is, wiping out all the idiots in the world. Yes, medical technology has allowed us to live longer, but GPS is here to even out the numbers a bit. Well, at the very least, boot the geniuses off of the road. It’s taken down another one, this time 43-year-old male, Robert Jones, who works as a driver. Yes, he does this for a living. He does it for a living is his excuse for listening so closely to the gadget.
 
The driver took the instructions down a Pennine footpath. When it told him the very narrow steep path was a road, he believed it. The only reason he stopped and didn’t attempt to drive his car down the cliff is that he hit a fence above the Gauxholme railway bridge. He described the Sunday morning incident involving his precious BMW to friends later on as “a nightmare”. Thankfully, the police are charging him with being a total idiot, although they’re calling it driving without due care and attention. I figure that’s police-speak for, too stupid to be driving. Hopefully, when he goes to court, they’ll confiscate his license or, at the very least, his sat-nav.
