# Unlock The Secret To Negotiate Your Dream Remote Work Setup - It's Easier Than You Think!

Work from home, telecommuting, remote work - whatever you want to call it, the trend of working from outside the traditional office environment is growing. With advances in technology, companies across various industries have found that allowing employees to work from home or a location of their choice can increase productivity, job satisfaction, and help reduce overhead costs.


But what if your current job doesn't offer remote work, and you're yearning for more flexibility in your schedule? It's time to negotiate.


Negotiating your remote work setup is a way to gain control over your schedule, save time and money on commuting, and create a work environment that will allow you to do your best work. Here's how you can unlock the secret to negotiating your dream remote work setup - it's easier than you think.


## Do Your Research and Gather Data

The first step in negotiating your remote work setup is to collect data that supports the effectiveness and efficiency of remote work. Look for statistics that show that remote work can increase productivity and job satisfaction, while reducing stress and absenteeism.


Some helpful resources you can use include academic studies, news articles, and research reports from reputable sources. Compile these resources into a presentation or document that you can use to present your case to your employer.


## Set a Clear and Compelling Vision

Once you've gathered data, create a clear and compelling vision of your ideal remote work setup. This should include what your work environment will look like, such as your home office or your favorite co-working space, your work hours, and your communication plan.


Think about any potential challenges that might arise from remote work, such as managing the time zone differences, and come up with solutions.


## Practice Active Listening

During the negotiation process, it's important to practice active listening. Hear what your employer has to say about the topic and what concerns they may have. You'll be in a better position to address those concerns if you listen to them first.


## Be Flexible

While it's essential to have a clear vision of what you want, it's important to be flexible, especially when negotiating with your employer. Consider their perspective and try to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.


## Follow Up and Evaluate

Once a plan is in place, it's crucial to follow up with your employer to ensure that the new arrangement is working well. Evaluate what's working and what isn't, and come up with solutions or adjustments as needed.


In conclusion, negotiating for a remote work setup is not only possible, but it's also easier than you think. The key is to do your research, set a clear and compelling vision, listen actively, be flexible, and follow up and evaluate. With these steps, you'll be one step closer to unlocking your dream remote work setup.

This article explains how to negotiate for a work-from-home arrangement with an employer.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- First: Make sure telecommuting works for you. Know the position you're after. Check company remote work policies.Approach employer: Create a written proposal. Include benefits to employer and job effectiveness.

 
##   Before You Work From Home  
 

First, make sure telecommuting is really for you. Working remotely is a dream for many, but it's not for everyone. You probably already know the benefits of telecommuting, but make sure you also know the disadvantages and carefully consider all the factors that will make telecommuting either successful or not for you personally (such as your ability to focus without supervision, comfort with being isolated from the office, quality of home/remote working environment, etc.).

 
If you're looking for a new job where you can work from home, there are many telecommuting jobs, but you'll need to learn the best places to look for a work-from-home position.
 

Before you approach your employer, you should have some knowledge about the at home opportunity you are after in relation to your current role and work to strengthen your negotiating position. Find out more about your company's existing remote work policies and evaluate where you fit in as an employee in terms of being greatly valued and trusted. This information can strengthen your case for telecommuting.

 

Do some extensive research that proves the benefits of telecommuting arrangements for employers that will be applicable to your company. Not too long ago, telecommuting was considered a perk, but today it's a common work style that benefits both the employee and the employer. You can use positive research findings of telecommuting benefits for employers, such as telecommuters' increased productivity and improved employee retention, to strengthen your proposal. GlobalWorkPlaceAnalytics.com is a great source for research on telework and telecommuting.

 
##   Approach Your Employer  
 

Once you've compiled your research, create a written proposal. This will help you fine-tune your request and will likely be taken more seriously than a casual mention. The proposal should include the benefits to your employer and details on how you will accomplish your job more effectively and efficiently. If you'd prefer to make your request in person, still write the proposal -- as practice for when you talk to your boss. It may be beneficial by starting small and proposing to try out working from home for two weeks or so to see how things go for both you and your employer.

 

It's important to get ready to discuss in person by brushing up on your negotiating skills. If it looks like your request will be turned down, find out why and offer a solution or compromise (e.g., part-time telecommuting vs. full-time, short trial run, etc.).

 
##   Once You Start at Home  
 

During any trial period, be sure to keep up your part of the agreement and maintain your productivity, of course (you can refer to your written proposal and the executed remote work agreement to stay on track). In order to show your commitment to the company, check-in regularly with your boss to show your progress and emphasize how working remotely has improved your work -- so that you can make this arrangement permanent.
