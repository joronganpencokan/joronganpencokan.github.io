The reason to add Ironclaw in this list is its build quality and requirement of players with bigger palm size. Also, the grip is just amazing on Corsair Ironclaw, but you will need to get used to the design. Ironclaw is not like a regular mouse, its big, rubber-coated and can be tough to manage in terms of weight. But due to the high sensor, you will require to use minimum hand movement to precisely aim your target.

One is a premium model comes with custom weight to adjust the overall weight of mouse and other one a all-rounder mid range model.
