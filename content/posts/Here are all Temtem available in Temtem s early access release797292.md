# Discover the Ultimate Temtem Catching Guide - Unlock All Temtem in Early Access Now!

Are you having trouble catching all of the Temtem in the Early Access version of the game? Fear not, for with this ultimate catching guide, you will be on your way to catching them all in no time!

Step 1: Stock up on Temcards
Temcards are the essential item required to capture Temtem. Make sure you have a good supply of Temcards before heading out on your Temtem-catching journey. You can purchase them from any Temporium shopkeeper or find them in the wild as drops or in treasure chests.

Step 2: Pay Attention to Temtem Types
Each Temtem belongs to one or two types, such as Water, Fire, or Electric. Knowing the type of Temtem you are facing is crucial as each type has strengths and weaknesses. Use this knowledge to your advantage by using the opposite type to weaken them before attempting to capture them.

Step 3: Use Status Conditions
Status conditions such as asleep, paralyzed, or poisoned greatly increase the chances of capturing a Temtem. Using moves that inflict these conditions can greatly increase your chances of catching them.

Step 4: Lower their HP
Reducing a Temtem's health to a lower level before attempting to capture them also increases the capture rate. However, be careful not to knock them out, as this will result in losing the chance to capture them.

Step 5: Utilize Temtem Attributes
Certain Temtem have attributes that can also increase the capture rate. For example, the attribute "Friendlier" increases the chances of capturing a Temtem, while the "Fury" attribute makes them more difficult to capture.

Step 6: Choosing the Right Tool
In certain situations, using a different capturing tool like the Balm or the Temcard+ might help to capture an elusive Temtem. Experiment with different tools and see which one works best for you.

Step 7: Tracking and Editing the Luma
Luma is the rarest type of the Temtem and is similar to a shiny Pokėmon. Tracking Luma locations and editing the lineage of the Temtem can increase your chances of obtaining them.

Following these steps will guide you towards catching all the Temtem in the Early Access version of the game. Good luck on your journey!
