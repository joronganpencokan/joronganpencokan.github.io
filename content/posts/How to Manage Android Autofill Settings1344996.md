# Android Users: You've Been Using Autofill All Wrong! Here's the Ultimate Guide to Managing Your Settings

If you're an Android user, chances are you've used Autofill at some point in time. Autofill is an awesome feature that saves users a lot of time and effort by automatically filling in forms and passwords, sparing you the headache of having to manually fill in the information yourself.

However, many people don't know how to manage their Autofill settings effectively. That's why we've created the ultimate guide to help you get the most out of this useful feature. 

## Step 1: Set up Autofill

Here, you'll see a list of available Autofill services. If you haven't done so already, make sure to choose a trusted Autofill service such as Google, LastPass, or Dashlane. 

## Step 2: Customize Your Autofill Settings 

Once you've set up Autofill, it's time to customize the settings to fit your preferences. To do this, go to "Autofill service > Settings."

Under "Autofill with Google," you can choose to toggle on or off various Autofill options such as addresses, credit cards, and passwords. You can also choose which Google account you want to use for Autofill.

Similarly, if you're using a third-party Autofill service, you can go to their respective settings to customize the fields that Autofill can fill in.

Here, you'll be able to see a list of saved Autofill entries such as addresses, credit cards, and passwords. To delete an entry, simply tap on the "X" icon next to it. 

## Step 4: Use Autofill to its Full Potential 

Now that you've set up and customized your Autofill settings, it's time to start using it to its full potential. Here are some tips to help you get started:

- Use Autofill to quickly fill in forms and passwords on websites and apps.
- Use a password manager like LastPass or Dashlane to securely store your login credentials.
- When entering contact information in a form, use Autofill to fill in your name, email address, and phone number quickly.
- Make sure to keep your Autofill data up to date, especially if you frequently change your contact information or credit cards.

With these tips and tricks, you'll be able to make the most out of Autofill and enjoy a more seamless browsing experience. 

## Conclusion 

Autofill is a powerful tool that can save Android users a lot of time and effort. By setting up and customizing your Autofill settings, you'll be able to use it to its greatest potential. So go ahead and give it a try, and see how it can change the way you browse and use your device.
