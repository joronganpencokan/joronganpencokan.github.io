Are you looking to unleash your inner assassin? Then you need to master the Pick Your Poison Challenge in Hitman 3 now! This challenge offers players the chance to eliminate targets in creative and elaborate ways, using nothing but a little bit of patience, cunning, and strategy. Here's how you can master this challenge and become the ultimate Hitman 3 assassin.

## Understanding the Challenge

The Pick Your Poison Challenge is similar to other Hitman 3 challenges, as it requires players to eliminate a target using specific tools and methods. In this case, players will need to use poison to eliminate their target, but there are specific restrictions to follow to complete the challenge successfully.

Players must use a specific type of poison and deliver it via a specific method, as specified by the challenge. For example, the challenge might require players to eliminate their target using lethal poison from a poisoned cocktail served by a specific bartender. 

## Finding Targets and Poison

The first step to mastering this challenge is to find your targets and acquire the appropriate poison. Targets for the Pick Your Poison Challenge can be found in any mission in Hitman 3, and there are several locations where players can find the poison they need.

One way to acquire poison is by exploring the level and finding it in a hidden location. Another method is to steal poison from a specific NPC. It's essential to plan your strategy and find the poison and the target before starting the challenge.

## Delivery and Execution

Once you have found your poison and identified your target, it's time to put your plan into action. The method you use to deliver the poison is just as important as the poison itself. You might need to dress up as a waiter to serve the poisoned dish to your target or swap out a bottle of poisoned wine for a regular one.

It's important to be patient and observe your target's movements to ensure that your plan is executed flawlessly. If you're too hasty or don't follow the challenge's restrictions, you risk failing the challenge and will need to start over again.

## Rewards

Successfully completing the Pick Your Poison Challenge in Hitman 3 will reward players with special unlocks, including new items, weapons, and outfits. These rewards offer players even more tools and strategies to use in future missions, making them even deadlier as they progress through the game.

## Conclusion

By mastering the Pick Your Poison Challenge in Hitman 3, players can unleash their inner assassin and take their killing skills to a whole new level. To succeed, players must be patient, creative, and execute their plans flawlessly. With the right tools and strategies, players can take on any challenge in Hitman 3 and become the ultimate assassin.
