Before you can start the installation process, you need to download the Windows 8 or 8.1 ISO file. You can get this file by visiting the Microsoft website or by clicking [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8) for Windows 8 or [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8ISO) for Windows 8.1. Save the file in a folder that's easily accessible.

## Step 2: Format Your USB Drive

Once you have the ISO file, it's time to format your USB drive. Insert the USB drive into your computer, and then go to File Explorer. Right-click on the USB drive and select "Format."

Once you're in the boot menu, select the USB drive as your boot device. Windows 8 or 8.1 should now start to install. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process. You should be up and running in no time!

To complete this process, you need:

 
Burning an ISO file to a USB drive as described in that article and below works equally well for Windows 11/10 users.
 
- A flash drive (4 GB for 32-bit, 8 GB for 64-bit).A Windows 8/8.1 DVD or ISO.Access to a working computer (with a DVD drive if you have a Windows 8 DVD) with Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8, or Windows 7 installed.

- Create an ISO file from the Windows 8 DVD. It's the procedure by which you create a single file, called an ISO image, containing all the data stored on the Windows 8 setup DVD.
 - Once you have an ISO image, come back here and continue with this tutorial to explain how to get it onto a flash drive.
 - If you already know how to create ISO files with your favorite program, often called "ripping," then do so in whatever way you're used to doing it. However, if you've never created one or don't have a program installed right now that does it, please see the linked tutorial above for complete instructions on doing so with a free program.
 - Burn the ISO file to a USB drive. That guide has you use the free Rufus program, but any similar program should get the job done as well.
 - Pay close attention to the Partition scheme and Target system options. If you have a UEFI-based system, change those options to GPT and UEFI (non CSM), respectively.
 - Boot from the USB device you just created to start the Windows 8 install process. You should now be installing from a USB device.
 - If the Windows 8 setup process doesn't start, you'll likely need to change the boot order in BIOS.
