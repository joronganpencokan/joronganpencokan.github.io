# Revolutionary Guide Reveals The Mind-Blowing Way To Install Windows On Steam Deck - Get Ready To Take Your Gaming To The Next Level!

The highly anticipated Steam Deck recently launched and gamers around the world are already enjoying the groundbreaking handheld device. However, as much as we love this gaming marvel, it has a limitation that could be the deal breaker for some: it runs on SteamOS. 

SteamOS is a Linux-based operating system that comes pre-installed on the Steam Deck, and while it offers impressive features, the truth is that it lacks support for many important games and applications. Most importantly, it does not support the entire Steam library, which means that some of your favorite games may not run on the device at all.

But here's the good news: you can install windows on your Steam Deck, and we're about to tell you how to do it.

## Why Should You Install Windows On Your Steam Deck?

By installing Windows on your Steam Deck, you'll be able to play almost every game in the Steam library without compatibility issues. You'll also gain access to an enormous variety of games and programs not available on SteamOS. 

Furthermore, Windows will allow you to use the Microsoft Store, giving you access to even more games not found in the Steam library. You can even use the Epic Games Store, which opens up a whole new world of gaming opportunities.

In short, installing Windows on your Steam Deck will significantly expand your choice of games, increase performance, and offer a better overall gaming experience.

## The Mind-Blowing Way To Install Windows On Your Steam Deck

The good news is that the process of installing Windows on your Steam Deck is straightforward and can be done with relative ease. Here's how:

### Step 1: Get A Windows Image 

You'll need a Windows image to install the operating system on your Steam Deck. You can purchase Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store, or you can download a free copy of Windows 10 from the Microsoft website.

### Step 2: Create A Bootable USB Drive 

Once you have the Windows image, you'll need to create a bootable USB drive. To do this, download the Rufus software, which is free and reliable. Follow the instructions on how to create a bootable USB drive, then copy the Windows image to it.

### Step 3: Install Windows On Your Steam Deck 

Now that you have a bootable USB drive with Windows installed, it's time to install the operating system on your Steam Deck. 

- Plug the bootable USB drive into your Steam Deck.
- Restart the device and tap the F2 key to enter the BIOS setup.
- In the boot menu, choose to boot from the USB drive.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to install Windows on your Steam Deck.

Voila! You've done it. Your Steam Deck now has Windows installed, and you're ready to start gaming like a boss.

## Conclusion

The Steam Deck is an impressive device that promises to revolutionize handheld gaming. However, by installing Windows on your device, you'll turn it into a true gaming powerhouse, expanding your gaming choices, and making the experience that much better. 

We hope this guide has been helpful and that you now have a better understanding of how to install windows on your Steam Deck. So get ready to take your gaming to the next level, and enjoy every moment of it!

This article explains how to install Windows on your Steam Deck, including how to run Windows from a micro SD card and how to replace SteamOS.  

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Insert bootable Windows USB drive/micro SD card > hold volume down and power button > select removable drive.
 - Alternatively, create a Windows installation USB drive.
 - Then, on Steam Deck: hold volume down and power, select EFI USB drive, and follow the on-screen prompts.

 
##   How to Get Steam Deck to Run Windows  
 

The Steam Deck comes with a modified version of Arch Linux called SteamOS, but the hardware is essentially just a handheld PC, so you are free to replace the existing OS with Windows or install Windows on an SD card or USB drive.

 

If you choose to replace SteamOS with Windows, you can switch back with Valve’s SteamOS recovery image. If you install Windows on a USB drive or SD card, you can switch between the operating systems freely each time you boot up your Steam Deck.

 
##   How to Dual Boot Windows and SteamOS on Steam Deck  
 

You can’t dual boot Windows and SteamOS on the built-in Steam Deck storage, but you can if you install Windows on a USB drive or a micro SD card. If you will only need Windows when your Steam Deck is stationary at home, preferably plugged into a powered dock, then you can use an external USB-C drive. If you want access to windows on the go, then an SD card is the most convenient option.

 
If you’re installing Windows 11, TPM needs to be enabled in the BIOS. If you have trouble, make sure your Steam Deck is fully updated, because it didn’t originally come with TPM support.
 

Here’s how to boot Windows from an SD card on a Steam Deck:

##   How to Install Windows on a Steam Deck  
 

You can also install Windows directly on your Steam Deck, but doing so will replace SteamOS. If you’ve downloaded any games on your Steam Deck, made any modifications, set up any emulators, or made any other changes, that will all be lost when you replace SteamOS with Windows. You can switch back to SteamOS later using the SteamOS recovery image, but that is essentially a factory reset that will require you to set up your Steam Deck from scratch.

 

Create a bootable Windows USB drive or micro SD card.

 

Connect the bootable USB drive to your Steam Deck, or insert the bootable SD card.

 

Make sure the Steam Deck is turned off.

 

Hold volume down and press the power button.

 

Select the USB drive or SD card.

 

The Steam Deck will boot into Windows.

 
The display will be sideways at this time.
 

Follow the on-screen prompts to complete Windows setup.

##   Why Install Windows On a Steam Deck?  
 

SteamOS is great at running games. Heck, it’s capable of playing a lot of games that are only playable on Windows. This is thanks to Proton, which is a compatibility layer that lets you run Windows games on Linux PCs.

 

Create a Windows installation drive.

 

Turn your Steam Deck off.

 

Connect your installation drive to the Steam Deck via USB.

 
You can use an adapter if necessary.
 

Hold volume down and press the power button, then release both.

 

Select EFI USB Device.

 

The Steam Deck will boot up with the Windows installer active. Verify the language and tap Next.

 
The display will appear sideways at this time.
 

Tap Install Now.

 

Enter a Windows activation key and tap Next, or tap I don't have a product key to proceed without a key.

 

Choose a Windows version, and tap Next.

 

Tap Next.

 

Tap Custom: Install Windows only.

 

Tap Drive 0 Partition 8, then tap Delete. You can then select Drive 0 Unallocated Space and tap Next.

 
SteamOS will no longer work after you delete Drive 0 Partition 8, so make sure you really want to install Windows directly on your Steam Deck before you do so. If you change your mind, you'll need to restore your Steam Deck using a SteamOS recovery image.
 

Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation of Windows.

 

When installation is complete, the Steam Deck will reset.

 

When the Windows desktop loads, navigate to Start > Settings > System > Display.

 

Select Display Orientation > Landscape.

 

There are a lot of games that run flawlessly in this way, and a lot more than run pretty well, but some games just need an actual Windows environment. If you play one or more of those games, and you want to play them on your Steam Deck, then you’ll need to install Windows.

 

Installing Windows on a Steam Deck also allows you to install other digital storefronts, like Epic and Origin, and play games you own through those platforms on the handheld. If you have a lot of games on those platforms, then you’ll benefit from installing Windows.

 

Aside from games, installing Windows on a Steam Deck also turns your handheld into a portable Windows PC. You can plug it into a monitor via the HDMI cable, connect a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, and have access to Windows on the go. If you have any apps that don’t run on Linux, or you just aren’t comfortable with Linux, this may be an attractive option.

 
##   Why Can’t You Dual Boot Windows and SteamOS?  
 

You can dual boot Windows and Linux, so it might come as a surprise you can’t dual boot Windows on your Steam Deck. The truth is that it actually is possible, but the process is very difficult and requires a lot of behind-the-scenes work that just isn’t viable for the average Steam Deck owner.

 

Two big issues are that the SteamOS takes up the entire internal drive with its own partitions when it’s installed, and both the Windows installer and Windows updates can break the bootloader that’s necessary to dual boot. There are ways around these issues, but they aren’t worth the trouble for the average user. Installing Windows to a microSD card is a much easier option.
