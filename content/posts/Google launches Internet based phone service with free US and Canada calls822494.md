Revolutionary! Google unveils groundbreaking phone service - unlimited free calls in US and Canada!

Google, one of the world's largest tech companies, has done it again! The search giant has launched a new phone service that promises to disrupt the telecoms industry. The service, called Google Voice, offers unlimited free calls to anyone in the US and Canada. This news is significant since many Americans and Canadians pay a considerable amount of money for phone calls.

Google Voice allows users to make calls to any number in the US and Canada for free from their computer, smartphone, or tablet. Users do not require a new phone number, as the service uses an existing phone number. The service can also receive calls and transcribe voicemails, which are accessible via the user's Google Voice account. Google Voice uses machine learning and AI to transcribe voicemails, making them searchable and easy to find.

Along with free calls, there are many other benefits to Google Voice. Users can send texts and initiate group chats with the service, and all of them are stored in the cloud. Transcriptions of voicemails and text messages are also searchable, which makes it easy for users to find past conversations.

Google Voice also offers a unique feature called 'call screening.' Call screening allows the user to see who is calling and choose whether to answer the call or send it to voicemail. This feature can be useful if the user is getting spam calls or wants to avoid certain callers.

The new Google Voice service is a massive disruptor in the telecoms industry. In the US and Canada, there are many people who pay a significant amount of money for phone calls. Google's free calling service will offer an alternative for these people.

Google is also known for disrupting industries with innovative products, such as Google Maps, Google Search, and Gmail. The company is using its technology to make phone calls cheaper and more accessible for everyone.

In conclusion, Google Voice is a groundbreaking new phone service that promises to make phone calls in the US and Canada cheaper and more accessible. The service is free and offers many additional features that cannot be found in traditional phone services. Google Voice is a significant disruptor in the telecoms industry, and it is exciting to see how this new service will change the way we make phone calls.

The giant of search, Google, just rolled out this morning Google Voice calls in Gmail! Now you are able to make phone calls right from your Gmail account in a browser to any land line in the US and Canada for free in 2010, and really low rates to make calls internationally. This VoIP technology is possible thanks to Gizmo5 acquisition back in 2009.
 
To use Google Voice to make phone calls, it’s really simple, next time that you login in your Gmail account, launch Calls by clicking on the “Call phone” option at the top of the chat list and then dial a number with your keyboard or enter a name from your contact list. Gmail users are going to be able to check who is calling before answering and read voice mails as well.
 
You can use your computer’s speakers and microphones as headsets; also Google voice subscriber can have incoming calls sent to their phones or Google chat in their browser.
 
For prepaid credits to make phone calls, you are going to use Google Checkout service, which should be available in the coming weeks (for now, if you are in the US or Canada you going to use Google Checkout for international calls only).
 
Google have really awesome products, no one can deny it. Gmail is a great example of a good product and what is possible in all our online communication today, but… I cannot stop wondering, what type of information Google is going to be able to collect with this new service? And, how they are going to use it?
