The ability to link Skype with a Microsoft account has been around for quite some time. The link was meant to simplify the sign in process, offer better integration with Outlook to merge your contacts, and now you can even use your Skype ID to sign in to other services, such as Xbox Live, Office, OneDrive, and others.
 
The problem is that even after linking both accounts, you can still access your Skype account using your legacy sign-in information, which is less secure than using a Microsoft account that implements better security and two-factor authentication.
 
If you want to make your Skype account more secure and reduce the number of credentials you have to remember, you can merge the accounts. Then you’ll only have one password to access all Microsoft services, including Skype.
 
In this guide, you’ll learn the steps to merge your Skype name with a Microsoft account.
 
## How to merge your Skype name with a Microsoft account
 
- Using your favorite web browser, open https://account.microsoft.com/.
 - Sign out of your Microsoft account if you’re signed in.
 - Enter your Skype credentials and click Next.
 - Your Skype account is now a Microsoft account
 - If your Skype account is already linked to a Microsoft account, you’ll prompt to enter the password of Microsoft account to do the merge. Enter your password and click Next.
 - Merge accounts using your Microsoft account password
 - Click OK to complete the task.
 - Complete Skype and Microsoft account merge

 
Once you completed the steps, Skype will be merged with your Microsoft account, and now you’ll have a single password, which you can use with your email address or Skype name to sign in to Microsoft services.
 
Using your favorite web browser, open https://account.microsoft.com/.
 
Sign out of your Microsoft account if you’re signed in.
 
Enter your Skype credentials and click Next.
 
Your Skype account is now a Microsoft account
 
If your Skype account is already linked to a Microsoft account, you’ll prompt to enter the password of Microsoft account to do the merge. Enter your password and click Next.
 
Merge accounts using your Microsoft account password
 
Click OK to complete the task.
 
Complete Skype and Microsoft account merge
 
If you want to make your account extra secure, make sure you’re not using the same legacy Skype password with your Microsoft account to prevent anyone from hacking your account with your old information. You can quickly change your password in the Security and privacy section of your Microsoft account online. 
 
Additionally, when you merge Skype with a Microsoft account an alias will be created to let you continue access services using your Skype name.
 
If you’re not planning to use your Skype name to sign in to Skype or other Microsoft services, you can disable the alias changing the Sign-in preferences in your Microsoft account online.
 
It’s important to note that after completing the process, you won’t be able to undo the merge.
