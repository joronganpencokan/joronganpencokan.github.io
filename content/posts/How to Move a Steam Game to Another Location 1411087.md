Title: Unlock the Secret Hack to Moving Your Steam Games to a New Location with These Easy Tips!

Introduction:

If you are an avid gamer who uses Steam to play your favorite games, you may have encountered the dilemma of having to move your games to a new location. Perhaps you need to upgrade your computer or perhaps you are running out of space on your hard drive. Whatever the reason may be, the thought of having to re-download all your games can be daunting. But there's good news: you don't have to.

With a few easy tips and some simple steps, you can move your Steam games to a new location without having to re-download them. In this article, we will reveal the secret hack to moving your Steam games to a new location.

Step 1: Create a new Steam library folder

The first step is to create a new Steam library folder in your desired location. This can be on an external hard drive, a new partition on your hard drive, or even on a network drive. To do this, open Steam and go to "Settings," then "Downloads," and finally "Steam Library Folders." Click "Add Library Folder" and select the location where you want to create your new folder.

Step 2: Move your games to the new folder

Once you have created your new Steam library folder, you can start moving your games to the new location. To do this, right-click on the game you want to move in your Steam library. Click "Properties" and then select the "Local Files" tab. Click "Move Install Folder" and select the new folder you created.

Step 3: Verify the game files

Once you have moved the game to the new folder, you need to verify the game files to ensure that everything is working correctly. To do this, right-click on the game in your Steam library and select "Properties." Select the "Local Files" tab and click "Verify integrity of game files." Steam will then check the game files for any errors and fix them if necessary.

Step 4: Enjoy your games in the new location

Congratulations! You have successfully moved your Steam game to a new location. You can now enjoy your games without having to re-download them. You can repeat these steps for all your Steam games, and you can even move your entire Steam library to a new location if you want. Just create a new library folder and move all your games to the new location.

Conclusion:

Moving your Steam games to a new location may seem like a daunting task, but it's actually quite simple. By creating a new library folder, moving your games, verifying the game files, and enjoying your games in the new location, you can save time and disk space. With these easy tips, you can unlock the secret hack to moving your Steam games to a new location. So, go ahead and start moving your games today!

In the past, in order to move Steam games to another hard drive, we had to write a pretty comprehensive guide about junction points and other moderately complex techy stuff. These days, however, Valve has made it much simpler to move games back and forth between drives by building the feature right into Steam. We’ll take you through the process – which is simpler than ever.
 
Before moving your Steam game, you’ll need to use Steam to create new save locations for your games.
 
First, open Steam, then in the top-left corner click “Steam -> Settings.”
 

 
In the Settings window, click Downloads in the pane on the left, then “Steam Library Folders.”
 
In the Steam Library Folders window, click “Add Library Folder,” then select the location on another drive where you’d like to install Steam games. Note that this doesn’t replace your original installation location for games but gives you an additional location to install them. Also, you’re only allowed to install Steam games in one location per drive.
 
Once you’re done, you can add additional Steam Library Folders to other drives in the same way. To change the default Library Folder, just right-click the one you want in the list and click “Make Default Folder.”
 
From now on, each time you install a game Steam will ask you which of your Steam Library Folders you’d like to install it to.
 
Now, to move an existing game to another drive, go to your Steam Library, right-click the installed game and click Properties.
 
In the Properties window click the “Local Files” tab, “Move Install Folder,” select which of your Steam Library Folders you’d like to move the game to and click “Move Folder.”
 
## Conclusion
 
The process may take a couple of minutes, but once it’s done, the game will be completely ported over to the new drive. We’ve never had issues using this feature, so you can move games around fairly freely without worrying about anything going wrong. Cheers, Valve.
