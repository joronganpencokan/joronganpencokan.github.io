## Ways To Remove Adware From Google Chrome Browser


Let’s admit; Chrome is right now the leading web browser available out there. It supports add-ons and extensions. Usually, the extensions downloaded from the Chrome web store were safe, but some websites attempt to install third-party extensions on your browser.
These third-party extensions were meant to install adware on your browser. Once installed, it will start to bombard your web browser with a banner, pop-ups, and every different type of annoying ad. Some of the extensions can even show adult ads on your web browser.
The adware could be silently running in the background, or it could be wreaking havoc right in front of you. The best way of knowing whether you have a rogue extension is to search for it in your extensions list. First, go through your Chrome extension settings, then uninstall any extension that you’re not familiar with.

 
### Identify and Remove Chrome Extension


1. Open your Google Chrome browser click on the three vertical dots.

2. A drop-down menu should appear. Scroll to the bottom and click on More Tools > Extensions.

 
3. This will open the Google Chrome Extension Manager. You need to go through the list to find suspicious extensions.
If you’re unfamiliar with a particular extension, then the chances are that its adware is masquerading as a natural extension.

That’s it! You are done. This is how you can identify and remove adware from your Google Chrome browser.

 
### Reset Your Google Chrome Settings


Google has made its move against adware by alerting you when there’s a possible intrusion. But it’s not always effective because sometimes the adware slips past the browser’s defenses and changes the settings without you knowing.

1. First, open the Google Chrome web browser and click on the three dots.

2. From the list of options, click on Settings.

3. On the Settings page, expand on the Advanced option as shown below.

4. On the expanded menu, click on the Reset and Clean up option.

5. On the right, click on the ‘Restore settings to their original defaults’ option.
