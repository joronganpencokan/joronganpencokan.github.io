GoPro has unveiled its new flagship product, the HERO10 Black, which can capture stunning 5.3K resolution video at 60 frames per second.

 

According to GoPro, this ability to capture such high resolutions is powered by the new GP2 processor, as the company finally lets go of the old GP1 from 2017.

 

The HERO10 Black combines its new processor with a 23.6-megapixel camera to record 4K video at 120 frames per second and capture 2.7K video at 240 frames per second. The HERO10 also can pull high-quality still images from the videos it takes, up to 19.6 megapixels.

 

It also boasts improved low-light performance, and a quicker user interface thanks to the GP2 processor.

 

HyperSmooth 4.0 video stabilization is included, which ensures the camera takes the smoothest, shake-free footage possible. The new stabilization feature increases the GoPro tilt limit to 45 degrees, so the footage will look smooth and steady even in the most chaotic of circumstances.

 

However, HyperSmooth 4.0 requires cutting the frame rate in half to be used, according to Mashable. It doesn’t work at higher resolutions.

 

The HERO10 connects to its cloud network when charging, and automatically uploads recent footage to a user’s GoPro cloud account. It backs up the footage at its original quality, but this feature is only available to users with a GoPro Subscription.

 

The HERO10 Black is currently available for purchase at $499 or $399 if you have a GoPro subscription.
