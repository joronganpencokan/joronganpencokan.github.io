Are you a Hitman 3 fan looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Well, look no further because I have put together this ultimate Hitman 3 PS4 controls guide to help you master the art of assassination like a pro! 

## Disguising Yourself 

One of the most crucial elements of Hitman 3 gameplay is disguising yourself. With a variety of different crowds to blend in with, this can be the key to moving from one area to another undetected. Here's how to do it:

- Press Triangle to enter the Interaction menu 
- Use the Left Stick to highlight the disguise you want to put on 
- Press X to select the disguise 

Once you've put on a disguise, be sure to move around and act like a part of the crowd to avoid detection. Additionally, certain disguises will give you access to specific areas, so always keep an eye out for those opportunities. 

## Interacting with Environment 

Another essential part of Hitman 3 gameplay is the ability to interact with your environment. From picking up weapons to creating distractions, here's how to do it effectively: 

- Press Triangle to enter the Interaction menu 
- Use the Left Stick to highlight the object or person you want to interact with 
- Press X to perform the interaction 

Some useful interactions to keep in mind include:

- Grabbing weapons: Locate useful weapons, such as knives and firearms, by interacting with them when you see them laying around. 

- Creating distractions: Interact with objects in the environment, such as radios or fountains, to create distractions and divert the attention of NPCs away from you. 

## Checking Inventory 

As a professional assassin, you always need to be aware of what tools and weapons you have at your disposal. Here's how to check your inventory in Hitman 3:

- Press the Touchpad to access the pause menu 
- Use the Right Stick to highlight the "Inventory" option 
- Press X to open your inventory 

In your inventory, you'll see all the weapons and tools you're currently carrying. You can also access your mission story, intel, and challenges from here, so be sure to check it often.
