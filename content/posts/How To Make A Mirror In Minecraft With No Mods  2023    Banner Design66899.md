A house interior design is incomplete without a mirror, especially if you are planning to build an aesthetic bathroom or bedroom. In this guide, we will take a look at how to make a mirror banner in Minecraft. Note that the mirror does not actually work but it will surely add a touch of ‘realism’ to your rooms.

 - Then, pick up Light Gray Wool and place it in the top two rows entirely.
 - This will create a Light Gray Banner. Drag and add it to your inventory.

That’s how to make a mirror in Minecraft (banner design). Now go ahead and place the item at your preferred location and that’s it. This is how you can make your house designs more realistic looking (even though the mirror doesn’t work). A lot of players are asking for a real mirror to be added in the game, which can be tough coding-wise because it needs to show the user-generated world back to the player. Many AAA games shy away from using a real mirror or find workarounds by adding a cracked mirror. Due to the existence of Raytracing though, the newer games have a significant advantage while depicting reflective surfaces.
 
But, I digress – back to Minecraft! You can check out this video by JohnRVF which uses the Loom to put patterns on the mirror banner. This is the second method which is also slightly quicker.
