Skype is a popular instant messaging and video calling application that enables people to connect with others all over the world. With Skype, you can make voice and video calls, send instant messages, share files, and much more.

One of the great features of Skype is the test call service. The test call service lets you identify and troubleshoot any issues with your microphone, speaker, or internet connection before you start a real call. This way, you can be sure that your call will go smoothly and without any glitches.

But many people are hesitant to use the test call service because they think it is too complicated or time-consuming. In reality, making a Skype test call is incredibly easy and takes only a few minutes.

## Step 3: Record a message

After you hear the message, record your message by speaking into your microphone. You can say anything you want, but it's a good idea to say something that will test your microphone and speaker, such as "Hello, this is a test call."

## Step 4: Listen to your message

Listen to your message and make sure it sounds clear and without any glitches. If you hear any problems, you can adjust your microphone and speaker settings in the "Audio settings" tab.

## Step 5: End the test call

When you're finished listening to your message, simply hang up the test call by clicking on the "Hang up" button.

After you install Skype on your computer or before an important call, verify that your audio is working well and that your computer's connection to the internet and to Skype are strong enough to facilitate a call. You also should check that you're able to hear well and that the person on the other end can hear you, too.

 
- Start Skype and log in to your account.
 - Select the Contacts tab in the panel on the left, which is where all your contacts are displayed. Among them, you'll see a link for the Echo/Test Sound Service. If your contact list is sorted alphabetically, it will appear under E. Select Echo/Test Sound Service to open its details on the main pane of the interface.
 - Select the calling button to initiate the call. A female voice will welcome you and introduce you to the service for 10 seconds.
 - After the beep, speak into your microphone; the service records your voice for 10 seconds, so for the most thorough test, continue talking for the duration. After the second beep, your recorded voice will playback for 10 seconds. Then, you'll hear the female voice again, explaining that the test has concluded.

 

If you hear your voice clearly during the playback, your audio is configured properly, and you can make voice calls without a problem. If you don't hear your own recording, your microphone might be misconfigured or damaged.
