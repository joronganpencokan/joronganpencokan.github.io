# Google TV vs YouTube TV: The Ultimate Showdown - Which One Wins?

In today's world, streaming TV has become a way of life for a vast majority of people. With so many options to choose from, it can be tough to figure out which streaming service is best for you. In this showdown, we are comparing two streaming services from Google: Google TV and YouTube TV. Which one comes out on top? Let's dive in and find out.

## What is Google TV?

Google TV is a streaming service launched in 2010 by Google. It is designed to bring all of your favorite content in one place. With Google TV, you can access streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video, among others. The service also comes with its own Android TV operating system, which provides users with a great viewing experience.

## What is YouTube TV?

YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service launched in 2017 by Google. It features over 80 channels, including major networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox. With YouTube TV, you can access content from your favorite TV shows, movies, and more. The service also offers a cloud DVR with unlimited storage, allowing you to record your favorite shows and movies to watch later.

## User Interface

When it comes to the user interface, there are some notable differences between Google TV and YouTube TV. Google TV features an intuitive user interface with a personalized home screen that provides recommendations based on your viewing history. With Google TV, you can easily search for content and access other streaming services.

On the other hand, YouTube TV has a more straightforward, user-friendly interface. The service's home screen displays content based on your preferences, making it easy to find the shows and movies you want to watch.

## Channel Selection

While both services offer different channel lineups, they each have their own unique benefits. Google TV provides access to a wide range of streaming services, allowing you to watch everything from popular TV shows to movies and live sports. Additionally, you can purchase or rent movies and TV shows on-demand, making it more convenient for users.

YouTube TV, on the other hand, offers over 80 channels, including ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox, and comes with the added benefit of a cloud DVR with unlimited storage, allowing you to record your favorite shows and movies to watch later.

## Price

When it comes to pricing, both services have their own unique pricing models. Google TV is free to access and does not require a subscription. Additionally, you only pay for the content you want to watch.

YouTube TV, on the other hand, requires a subscription, which starts at $64.99 per month. However, the service comes with a free trial, allowing you to test the service before committing to a subscription.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, both Google TV and YouTube TV offer unique features that make them great choices for your streaming needs. If you're looking for a streaming service that provides access to a wide range of content, Google TV is the right choice for you. On the other hand, if you're looking for a live TV streaming service that includes all your favorite channels and comes with a cloud DVR, YouTube TV is your best bet. Ultimately, the decision comes down to your personal preferences and your budget.

Google TV is a service that merges the digital movie and TV store from Google Play with a dashboard that displays content from other streaming services. YouTube TV is a digital alternative to the traditional cable provider that offers many live TV channels and a cloud DVR feature for watching content later. We gave each service a look to make it easier to choose between the two and better understand how Google TV and YouTube TV work.  

 
##   Overall Findings  
 

Google TV and YouTube TV are both solid products offering very different services. YouTube TV is a competitive alternative to cable with over 85 live channels for one fixed monthly price. Additional channels are available as add-ons, and all can be, and you can record all of it with the cloud DVR feature that boasts unlimited storage. Those thinking about leaving their traditional cable provider should look at YouTube TV.

 
- The new place to buy or rent content from Google Play Movies and TV.
 - Dashboard also displays content from linked services.
 - Google TV app isn’t available on all platforms which can be confusing.

 
- Unlocks over 85 live TV channels.
 - Unlimited cloud DVR for recording content.
 - YouTube TV apps are available on almost every major platform.
 - Some limited on-demand content

 

Google TV is a typical digital storefront that offers film and TV purchases and rentals. What sets it apart from its rivals is its ability to display content from connected services and offer suggestions powered by Google’s user data. However, what brings Google TV down is the limited availability of its apps, which restricts what features you may be able to use on your devices. 

 
##   Platform and App Availability: YouTube TV Is Everywhere, Google TV Isn’t  
 

YouTube TV is the more consistent of the two regarding app and device support. You can find YouTube TV apps on many popular smart TVs, video game consoles, Roku, Fire TV Stick, and Chromecast with Google TV streaming sticks, iPhone and iPad, Apple TV, and Android tablet and smartphones. The experience is also reasonably consistent between each app version.

 
- Built into Chromecast with Google TV sticks and Google TV smart TVs.
 - Google TV app available on Android devices.
 - Purchased media watchable also via Google Play Movies and TV and YouTube.
 - Watchlist and media viewing functionality available on web.

 
- YouTube TV app available on a large number of Samsung, HiSense, Android TV, and Vizio smart TVs.
 - Xbox and PlayStation consoles support the YouTube TV app.
 - YouTube TV app available on Fire Stick, Chromecast with Google TV and Roku streaming sticks.
 - iPhone, iPad, and Android smartphone and tablet app support.

 

Google TV has an app for Android devices and has its functionality integrated heavily into the operating systems on Chromecast with Google TV sticks and smart TVs running Google TV. That’s about it. Media purchased or rented can be viewed on other devices via the regular YouTube app or the old Google Play Movies and TV app, but these don’t support Google TV’s Watchlist and dashboard.

 
##   Live and On Demand Content: One Is Not Like the Other  
 

Content is where Google TV and YouTube TV differ. YouTube TV acts as a digital alternative to traditional cable services by offering over 85 channels streamed live from within its apps. All YouTube TV channels are live broadcasts, but a built-in DVR cloud service with unlimited storage does let you record programs for later, though. YouTube TV does offer some on-demand content from the various channels as part of your subscription, but many shows and films feature commercials, and the selection is limited.

 
- Movies and TV series available to buy and rent from Google.
 - Integration with other services for more on-demand content.
 - No support for live TV or broadcasts in the Google TV app.

 
- Over 85 live channels with the main plan.
 - Additional premium channels available as add-ons.
 - Some on-demand content but limited and with some ads.

 

Google TV is a dedicated digital storefront with on-demand films and episodes that users can rent or purchase. The main focus of Google TV is its digital store, which is a rebranding of Google Play Movies and TV. The Google TV apps, Chromecasts, and smart TVs can also display available content from other services you use, but you will need to subscribe to those services to view their content. For example, if you have an HBO Max subscription, you will see recommendations for its shows and films within Google TV amongst the native Google TV purchases and suggestions.

 
##   Cost: YouTube TV Is a Cable Cutter’s Dream  
 

Comparing the cost of using Google TV and YouTube TV isn’t easy as each service works slightly differently than the other. The Google TV app and service are free to use on all of its supported devices, but you’ll need to purchase shows and films from Google within the app or connect to another service to stream additional content.

 
- Content needs to be purchased or unlocked via a separate service.
 - Movies cost around $5 to rent and $5-25 to buy directly from Google TV.
 - TV episodes average around $3 each.

 
- $64.99 per month to access to over 85 channels.
 - $5-15 for premium channel add-ons.
 - YouTube TV is cheaper and easier to understand than regular cable plans.

 

YouTube TV is much more straightforward than Google TV. A $64.99 monthly subscription unlocks over 85 channels. You can add additional premium channels with prices ranging from $5 per month for AMC premiere to $15 per month for HBO Max. A $25 bundle, called the Entertainment Plus package, is also available, including HBO Max, Showtime, and Starz.

 
##   Final Verdict: Are Google TV and YouTube TV the Same?  
 

Google TV and YouTube TV are very different streaming services that don't compete with one another at all. At least not directly.

 

For the most part, Google TV is an upgrade of Google Play Movies and TV. People can use it to buy or rent on-demand content from Google directly or access content from other services they already subscribe to within one convenient dashboard.

 

YouTube TV is more of a solution for cable cutters looking to switch to a cheaper, more affordable cable solution. Its unlimited cloud DVR is a special bonus, and the number of channels included in the base plan is impressive. YouTube TV's on-demand content can be hit-or-miss, though, depending on what series or film you're looking to watch.

 

If you're after live TV channels, YouTube TV is for you. However, if you're looking for a place to buy or rent digital content, Google TV is a solid option.

 
##   Does Google TV Have YouTube TV?  
 

The YouTube TV app is available to download for smart TVs powered by Google TV and Chromecast with Google TV streaming sticks. The app will likely come pre-installed on your Google TV hardware but, if it isn’t, you should be able to find it within the device’s app store.
