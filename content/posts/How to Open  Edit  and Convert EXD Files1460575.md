The EXD file format is commonly used in Microsoft Office programs, including Excel and Word, and is essential for certain functionalities within these applications. However, it can be frustrating when you receive an EXD file you cannot access or edit. This is precisely why it is essential to know how to open, convert, and edit EXD files in a simple and effective manner.

This article will guide you on unlocking the power of EXD files and give you a few simple tricks that can be used for easy access and editing of these formats.

What is an EXD File?

An EXD (Excel Dialog Box) file is a binary file generated by Microsoft Excel and is used to store information about custom controls that are embedded in Excel spreadsheets. These controls are used to add functionality to the spreadsheet or automate specific tasks in Excel, such as form creation or macros.

Why is it Important to Know how to Edit EXD Files?

Understanding how to edit EXD files is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it can save time by automating repetitive tasks, adding new functionalities to the file, or increasing user input control. Secondly, it helps to optimize the file's performance by reducing the size of the file, removing inefficiencies and improving the user experience.

How to Edit and Convert EXD Files?

The process of editing an EXD file can be challenging, and often requires expensive and complicated software. However, there is a simple trick that can be used to convert an EXD file into an editable format.

Step 1: Rename the File

Begin by opening the Windows Explorer and navigating to the directory where the EXD file is stored. Right-click on the file and select 'Rename' from the context menu. Rename the file by replacing the .exd extension with .zip. For example, if the file's name is 'example.exd,' rename it to 'example.zip.'

Step 2: Extract the Files

After the file has been renamed, right-click on it and select 'Extract All' from the context menu. The file will be extracted to a new folder with the same name as the original file, but with the .zip extension.

Step 3: Edit the Files

Inside the extracted folder, you will find a subfolder named 'customUI.' This subfolder contains an XML file (.xml) that can be edited using any text editor such as Notepad or Microsoft Word.

Make necessary changes to the XML code and save the changes. Zip the contents of the extracted folder and rename the new file extension back to .exd. Your edited file is now ready.

In conclusion, understanding how to edit and convert EXD files is essential in optimizing the performance of Microsoft Excel and Word. By renaming and extracting the files, making necessary changes within the exported files, and saving them, the process can be made much simpler, quicker, and cost-effective.

This article explains what an EXD file is and why there's one or more on your computer.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Some EXD files are Control Information Cache files.MS Office and Visual Studio create these files automatically in response to ActiveX controls.There's likely no way (or reason) to open or convert this type of EXD file.

 
##   What Is an EXD File?  
 

The EXD file extension is a Control Information Cache file. Microsoft Office programs build EXD files automatically when an ActiveX control has been inserted into a document.

 

The EXD file is a temporary file with the purpose of speeding up the process of adding controls into the document, like option buttons and text boxes. The program normally removes EXD files when it no longer requires that ActiveX control.

 

Other EXD files are most likely encrypted XML documents used with some reader programs for blind or hard-of-sight computer users.

 
##   How to Open an EXD File  
 

These files are utilized automatically by Office apps and Microsoft's Visual Studio, meaning you probably can't open them manually.

 

Microsoft programs typically store EXD files in the user's \AppData\Local\Temp\ folder, either under an Excel or VBE subfolder.

 
##   Troubleshooting EXD Files  
 

If you're having issues with broken macros in Microsoft Word or Excel, be sure the program is closed down and then delete the EXD files found in these folders to restore functionality (you can do this manually or with Temp File Deleter). See this Stack Overflow thread for more on this fix, as well as what patch from Windows Update is to blame for it.

 

Your EXD file is most likely in the format described above, but the Netherlands-based site Passend Lezen also uses EXD files that are saved in the XML format. It's possible that renaming it to .XML will let you open it with an XML reader.

 

If a program on your computer opens EXD files, but it shouldn't, or you'd rather another program be that default program, there are ways to change file associations in Windows.

 
Files with the EXD extension look a lot like ones that have the ESD, EXE, and HXD file extension. If your file isn't opening using the information from above, double-check to make sure you're reading the file extension correctly.
 
##   How to Convert an EXD File  
 

We don't believe there's any reason to convert a Control Information Cache file to any other format. These files are used exclusively in Microsoft programs and are only designed to work with ActiveX-related objects, so converting them would be useless even if such a file converter existed.

 

If you suspect your EXD file is used with an application related to the website mentioned above, we suggest either contacting them for more information or renaming the file to an XML file. If that works, you can then convert it like you can any XML file.
