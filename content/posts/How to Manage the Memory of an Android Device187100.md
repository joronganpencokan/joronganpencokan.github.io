#Never Run Out of Storage Again: Master the Art of Android Memory Management!

An Android phone is one of the most versatile gadgets that can be owned today; it has a lot of features that can make life easier if used correctly. However, when an Android phone is used without keeping Android memory management in mind, it can be frustrating, especially when its memory gets full, and you run out of storage space.

Fortunately, there are several ways to manage Android memory to ensure you don't get caught up in such a situation. Here are some tips to help you manage your memory better and avoid running out of storage.

##Always Check Available Memory

One of the most essential steps in managing your Android memory is to check the amount of available memory. Having an idea of how much storage capacity you have on your phone can be helpful. That way, you can decide if you need to delete some files or transfer them to an external storage device.

You can check the available memory of your phone by going to the settings menu and finding the "Storage" option. Choosing this option will show you how much of your storage space is currently used and how much is available. From there, you can make informed decisions on removing files you don't need anymore.

##Clear Cache Data

One of the reasons why your phone can quickly run out of memory is due to the cache data stored on it. Cache data is temporary files that are created by different apps when they are used, and they help to speed up the apps' performance in the future.

Clearing these cache files can free up a significant amount of storage on your phone. You can do this by going to the settings menu, selecting the "Apps" option, and then clicking on each app to clear its cache data.

Alternatively, you can use third-party apps such as Clean Master and CCleaner to help you remove cache data from your phone quickly and efficiently.

##Uninstall Apps You Don't Use

It's easy to fill up your phone's memory with apps you don't use regularly. It's essential to uninstall such apps as they can take up valuable memory space that can be used for more critical files.

To uninstall apps, go to the apps settings menu, select the app, and click on the "Uninstall" option.

##Move Large Files to an External Device

If you have files that you don't need to access regularly, you can store them on an external device such as a USB drive or an SD card. By doing this, you free up valuable memory on your phone, and you can still access the files when you need them.

To move files to an external device, insert the device into your phone's USB port or SD card slot and follow the prompts on your phone to transfer the files.

##Use Cloud Services

If you want to keep your files within reach but don't want to store them on your phone, cloud services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive can be very useful. These services allow you to store your files on a remote server and access them from any device with internet access.

To use this service, sign up with your preferred cloud service and upload your files. You can then access these files from your phone by logging into your account.

##Conclusion

By following the above tips, you can efficiently manage your Android memory and avoid running out of storage space. Always remember to check your available memory, clear cache data regularly, uninstall unused apps, move large files to an external device, and consider using cloud services to store your files remotely. These steps will ensure that you always have enough storage space for vital files and can use your phone efficiently.

Who doesn’t hate the “Storage is getting low” notification? I know I do.  No matter how big your internal memory or SD card is, it will get full sooner or later if you don’t keep an eye on it. And the more you take time to realize this, the harder it will be for you to manage it later. Internal memory or the SD card is the spot where everything gets reserved. From apps to movies and pictures you download from the Web, thee memory saves it all. And when you download, some of the space in the memory gets filled up. Here in this tutorial, we will learn to manage the memory of an Android device.
 
How to Manage the Memory of an Android Device.
 
There are 4 basic way to manage you device’s memory – Clear Cache, Move to SD card, Clear Data and Uninstall.  All these can be accessed by going to Settings > Apps/ Applications/ Application Manager and selecting an app.
 
## Clear Cache
 
Cache is like the library for your apps. The apps you download store certain data to retrieve it later on. This is why some post you previously saw on your Facebook app while you were online can also be seen while you’re offline. Cache size gets bigger over time. Clear it to free up some memory. Clearing cache can also make some apps work that didn’t run properly previously; like clearing cache of Google Play Store can make it work if the update was unsuccessful.
 
## Move to SD card
 
This feature can be found on android phones running JellyBean and above. What this does it that it moves the entire application to the SD card from your phone memory. If your device is rooted, you can also move system applications to the SD card but this is no recommended as moving system app onto SD card can make your device unusable. Some device running Ice Cream Sandwich and below can also move the applications to SD card it their device is rooted. There are various tutorials over the Web.
 
## Clear Data
 
Clearing data of any application will clear up all the data of the application. This is not recommended. If you’re clearing up data of Facebook or Instagram all the data related to the app will be related such as account info and cache. But not all apps behave like this. If you clear data of apps that downloads database after you install it from the Play Store such as Asphalt 8, you will need to download the database again when you open the app. Clear data at your own risk.
 
## Uninstall
 
This, as the title suggests, removes the app from your device. Do this only if you don’t need an application anymore. You can free up memory by uninstalling the app you downloaded previously but you dot use it anymore. For best result, clear the data of the app you want to install before actually uninstalling the app. This will ensure that no residue is left after the app is removed.
 
So in short, you can clear cache, move to SD card, clear data and uninstall the app to free up some memory.  If you have any other method, don’t hesitate to leave us a comment.
