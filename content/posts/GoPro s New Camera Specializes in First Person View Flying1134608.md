If you are a fan of adrenaline-pumping outdoor activities like flying, GoPro's latest release is a game-changer for you. Their new camera is explicitly designed for first-person view (FPV) flying, making it the ultimate accessory to revolutionize your aerial footage.

But what makes this GoPro camera so different than the others, you may ask? Well, unlike traditional GoPro cameras, the new GoPro HERO 9 Black is a modular camera that comes with an interchangeable lens cover. This means you can easily swap out your lens depending on your specific flying conditions, making it more versatile than ever before.

But that's not all. With the new Max Lens Mod accessory, you can have ultra-wide-angle, smooth horizon leveling vision, and improved low-light performance. This feature means that you don't have to compromise image quality even when flying in low light. This update is a massive deal for those who enjoy flying at dusk or in other low-light conditions.

Moreover, GoPro HERO 9 Black also comes with HyperSmooth 3.0 video stabilization technology. This feature ensures that all your footage is smooth, clear, and immersive, no matter how bumpy your flying experience may be. With this, you can create stunning and seamless videos without any shakiness, making your viewers feel like they're right onboard with you.

The aerial photo enthusiasts are sure to love the new horizon lock feature of the GoPro HERO 9 Black, which ensures your shots are level and clean consistently. This feature comes with four digital lenses to choose from to make the perfect shot every time.

Another impressive feature is the improved 1080p live streaming, which allows you to broadcast your footage to the world instantly. You can instantly stream your flying experience on YouTube Live and other platforms, allowing the world to witness and appreciate your excellent work.

Lastly, the GoPro HERO 9 Black comes with an improved battery life feature that lasts 30% longer than its predecessor. It means you can stay in the sky for longer and enjoy more unforgettable adventurous flying experiences without worrying about the battery life of your camera.

With these fantastic features, the GoPro HERO 9 Black can make your aerial footage outstanding and revolutionary, taking your flying experiences to a new level. So, don't wait any longer, grab your pack and be ready for your next adventure!

GoPro has launched the HERO10 Black Bones, a new camera similar to its flagship HERO10 Black but with a lighter form factor.

 

According to GoPro, the Black Bones camera has been designed to weigh only 54 grams so that it can be easily placed on top of drones for First Person View (FPV) camerawork. It can also be connected to a drone's battery to extend its life so long as it meets the drone's specifications. Other features include the HyperSmooth functionality and the ReelSteady desktop app.

 

The FPV videos GoPro is referring to are those viral videos of a drone flying through an area in a single shot. They point specifically to the Tesla Giga Factory tour and bowling alley video by YouTuber jaybyrdfilms as examples of this stunning camerawork.

 

To ensure this quality, the Black Bones camera can capture 4:3 video at 4K resolution and 60 FPS or 5K at 30 FPS. It can also capture super slow-motion video at 2.7K resolution and 120 frames per second. The device's enclosure is also well ventilated for continuous cooling on long flights.

 

Flying through the air on a drone will be a bumpy ride, so the Black Bones comes with the HyperSmooth feature to help stabilize the video. The camera even comes with the recently announced GoPro Player + ReelSteady desktop app for professional-grade editing and reframing.

 

The HERO10 Black Bones is currently available in the US, with no indication if the camera will launch in other countries. You can buy it for $399.99 with a GoPro Subscription for one year or $499.99 without the subscription.
