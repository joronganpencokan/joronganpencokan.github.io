# HBO Showdown: You Won't Believe the Shocking Differences Between HBO Max and HBO Go!

If you're a fan of premium TV, you're probably familiar with HBO. After all, the network has been producing some of the most acclaimed shows of the past few decades, from The Sopranos to Game of Thrones. However, if you've been keeping up with the streaming wars, you might be confused about the different options when it comes to watching HBO on your device. In this article, we'll break down the differences between HBO Max and HBO Go, so you can figure out which one is right for you.

### What is HBO Max?

HBO Max is the latest streaming service from HBO's parent company, WarnerMedia. It launched in May 2020 and is a comprehensive platform that includes all the content from HBO, as well as a vast library of other TV shows and movies. Think of it as HBO on steroids.

So what can you expect from HBO Max? For starters, there are all the shows and movies that you'd find on HBO proper, such as Westworld, Insecure, and Curb Your Enthusiasm. But the library on HBO Max goes well beyond that. You'll find tons of classic TV shows, like Friends, The Big Bang Theory, and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. There's also a large collection of movies, including blockbuster franchises like Harry Potter, The Matrix, and DC Comics.

But that's not all. HBO Max also features exclusive original programming that you won't find anywhere else, such as the reboot of Gossip Girl, the sci-fi epic Raised by Wolves, and the Seth Rogen comedy An American Pickle. Plus, there are countless documentaries, reality TV shows, and children's programming options.

### So what is HBO Go?

HBO Go is HBO's older streaming platform, which has been around since 2010. It's been the go-to option for subscribers who wanted to watch HBO content on their smart devices. But with the advent of HBO Max, HBO Go has been phased out.

Despite its phase-out status, HBO Go is still available to subscribers who signed up before HBO Max launched. However, it's significantly less comprehensive than HBO Max. Essentially, HBO Go only features the content that is currently available on HBO proper, which means you'll be missing out on a lot of the new original programming and library content that you get with HBO Max.

### How do they differ?

The main difference between HBO Max and HBO Go is the amount of content available on each platform. HBO Max is by far the more comprehensive option, providing you with all the shows and movies from the entire HBO library, plus a vast selection of other content from WarnerMedia's catalog. In contrast, HBO Go is a pared-down option that only includes the shows and movies that are currently available on HBO proper.

Another crucial difference between the two platforms is their pricing structure. If you have an HBO subscription through a cable provider, you'll be able to access HBO Go for free. However, to access HBO Max, you'll need to sign up for a separate subscription, which costs $14.99 per month. While that might seem steep, it's comparable to the pricing of other premium streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.

### Which one should you choose?

So which streaming option is right for you - HBO Max or HBO Go? If you're a die-hard fan of the HBO originals and don't need a lot of extra bells and whistles, HBO Go might be sufficient. However, if you want access to the full HBO library, as well as a vast collection of other content, plus exclusive originals and a large selection of kids programming, HBO Max is the way to go. And considering that its pricing is equivalent to other premium streaming services, it's definitely worth checking out.

HBO Go is HBO's legacy streaming service. HBO Go is still around, but only sort of. In fact, HBO Go is now just called HBO. HBO Max is HBO's main streaming service now. Let's tune in to see what the differences are.

 
##   Overall Findings  
 

The above findings, as well as those in the below sections, are largely hypothetical. In practice, if you're new to HBO streaming services, you'll almost certainly need to go with HBO Max (but, as shown in the Final Verdict below, this isn't a bad thing). HBO Go was discontinued as a standalone service in July 2020, instead re-branded to simply "HBO." The only way you can use the HBO app (previously HBO Go) now is if you were an existing customer, and/or you're using a device or service provider that doesn't support HBO Max yet.

 
- Includes exclusive content
 - Available to both video service subscribers and streamers
 - Still absent on some key streaming platforms

 
- Previously included with traditional cable channels
 - Now only available where HBO Max is not
 - Contains HBO content, but not other properties

 

That said, HBO has really done their work in loading up Max with all their best stuff. There are reasons to consider it even if you do have the premium channel through your service provider. With a selection of content from other Warner properties (notably Turner-related channels such as Cartoon Network and Turner Classic Movies) in addition to all the great stuff from HBO, you should only use "vanilla" HBO if you have to.

 
##   Content: Max Has, Well, the Max  
 

The primary difference between HBO (Go) and Max is the latter's exclusive content. Both services will give you a great selection of movies, original scripted series, and documentaries. But Max also includes a number of "channels" including the following:

 
- Includes HBO Movies & Series
 - Exclusive Warner Brothers content (e.g. DC Comics)
 - Expansive access to other content such as Sesame Street and Crunchyroll

 
- Includes HBO Movies & Series
 - Mirrors what's available on traditional cable
 - Non-HBO "channels" such as Cartoon Network missing

 
- DC Comics, including both live movies, original shows, and animated featuresSesame WorkshopTurner Classic MoviesAnime from Studio Ghibli and CrunchyrollCartoon Network programming, including Adult SwimTurner Classic Movies

 

On top of all this, there are also a growing number of titles branded as "Max Originals," suggesting that the divide in content between Max and its sibling is only going to grow over time.

 
##   Cost and Availability: While Max is Still Missing in Places, Go Will Eventually Go  
 

From the cost perspective, the two services are similar. HBO Max is $14.99 per month (plus tax), where HBO can range in price depending on your video service provider. It's likely that HBO on its own will be as much, or perhaps slightly more, than Max. But you may be able to get HBO for cheaper than HBO Max if your service provider has bundles of premium packages available.

 
- Available to anyone
 - Many service providers offer it directly
 - Some service providers don't enable access

 
- Available on platforms/through service providers not supporting Max
 - Possibly cheaper than Max depending on cable provider bundles
 - Can be more expensive than Max without a discounted bundle

 

Some service providers (such as Xfinity and DirecTV) are now offering Max directly to their customers. This means all the Max content is available through your set-top box, and that you can log into Max on a different device using your service provider account. If your provider is one that is not yet on-board with HBO Max you can still subscribe to it, but you'll have to manage the two separately (e.g. viewing HBO Max to one of your screens via Chromecast instead of using a set-top box).

 
##   Compatibility: Both Are On Most Platforms, But HBO Will Fade  
 

Now that HBO's prior (and admittedly confusing) streaming services are being folded into HBO Max, it's no surprise that it's available on most of the important platforms, including:

 
- Available on most major streaming platforms
 - Not compatible with some key streaming devices
 - In some cases, HBO Go accounts are "upgraded" to Max

 
- Compatible with most major streaming platforms
 - But only available where Max is not yet
 - In some cases, HBO Go accounts are "upgraded" to Max

 
- Desktop OSes via the web (Windows and macOS are officially supported)
 - Android devices, including Android TV (running version 5 and above)
 - iOS devices (iOS 12.2+)
 - Apple TVs 4th generation and later
 - Chromebooks and Chromecast devices
 - Playstation 4 and Xbox One consoles
 - Samsung TVs released after 2016

 

Notably absent from this list is Roku devices. Roku and HBO have been in a well-publicized disagreement over who can sell HBO Max subscriptions, and as a result the HBO Max app isn't available on any Roku devices. While the two may iron out their differences in time, if you're an all-Roku household (as I am), you'll be relegated to the older HBO Go-based app on those devices.

 
##   Final Verdict: Unless You Have a Great Reason, Go With Max  
 

As mentioned above, as of late July HBO Max is the only game in town. But even if HBO Go was still around, there would have been few reasons to use it over Max. With an expanded catalog including exclusive content and the ability to use it in conjunction with your cable TV's HBO premium channel service, HBO Max is the way to go for most people. The only drawback is if some or all of your streaming devices don't yet have access to the new Max app. But otherwise, go for HBO Max, confident you're getting the best the service has to offer.
