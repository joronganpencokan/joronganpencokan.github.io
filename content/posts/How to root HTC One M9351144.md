Unlock the Full Potential of Your HTC One M9 with This Simple Rooting Guide!

Are you an owner of an HTC One M9 and looking to maximize its potential with customizations and more advanced features? Then it's time to consider rooting your device. Rooting is the process of gaining access to the root directory of your device, which allows greater control over the system and the ability to customize your phone in ways that are not possible with a standard or "stock" device.

Why Root Your HTC One M9?

Rooting can provide several benefits for HTC One M9 owners. Here are just a few:

1. Customization: Rooting opens up a world of customization options that are not available on a stock device. With a rooted device, you can add new themes and change the look and feel of your device to your liking.

2. Improved performance: You can also improve the performance of your HTC One M9 by rooting it. With access to the root directory, you can optimize the system to run smoother and faster.

3. More advanced features: Rooting your device also unlocks more advanced features that are not available on a stock device. For example, you can install custom ROMs that offer unique features and customizations.

4. Removing bloatware: If you're tired of the pre-installed apps on your HTC One M9 taking up valuable storage space, rooting allows you to remove them completely.

How to Root Your HTC One M9

Rooting your HTC One M9 is a relatively simple process, but it's important to follow the steps carefully to ensure that you don't damage your device or void your warranty. Here's a step-by-step guide to rooting your HTC One M9:

Step 1: Unlock the bootloader

Before you can root your HTC One M9, you need to unlock the bootloader. This is the first step in gaining access to the root directory. Visit HTC's website (htcdev.com) to get started.

The next step is to download and install TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project), which is a custom recovery tool that allows you to perform advanced functions on your device. You can download the latest version of TWRP for your device from their official website.

Step 3: Download SuperSU

SuperSU is a popular app that allows you to manage root access on your device. Download the latest version of SuperSU and save it to your device.

Step 4: Boot into TWRP

With TWRP installed, you need to boot into recovery mode. To do this, turn off your HTC One M9, then press and hold the Volume Down button and the Power button until you see the Bootloader menu. From there, select "Recovery" to boot into TWRP.

Step 5: Flash SuperSU

Once you are in TWRP, select "Install" and navigate to the location where you saved SuperSU. Select the file and swipe to confirm the installation.

Step 6: Reboot

After SuperSU has finished installing, select "Reboot System" to reboot your device. Congratulations! You have successfully rooted your HTC One M9.

The HTC One M9 might not be as impressive a handset as the Galaxy S6, but it still has one major advantage over the it — an unlockable bootloader. This makes gaining root access on the handset easier as well as allows third-party developers to easily create ROMs and mods for it. 
Rooting the One M9 is similar to almost all the HTC devices released in the last year or two. This means that owners of previous generation One who rooted the handset will feel right at home while rooting the One M9 as well. Since the One M9 bootloader is not unlocked right out of the box, it needs to be unlocked first.
This means that unlocking the bootloader during the process of rooting will wipe all data from the handset including any files and photos stored on the internal storage. Thus, One M9 owners are recommended to make a backup of all their data before proceeding with the steps below.
Step 1: Before rooting the One M9, the bootloader of the handset must be unlocked. This can be achieved by heading over to HTC’s Dev website which has a detailed step-by-step guide on how to unlock the bootloader along with download links for all the files required during the process. Users, however, are first required to register on the site.
Once the boot loader has been unlocked, the device will reboot into Android OS.

Step 2: After setting up the device again, transfer the SuperSU ZIP file to the internal storage of the One M9. With the bootloader unlocked, it is now time to install TWRP recovery on the handset.
TWRP recovery for One M9 can be downloaded from here.
Step 3: Transfer the TWRP recovery image file to the same folder containing the ADB/Fastboot that was created while unlocking the bootloader of the handset in Step 1. Also, make sure to rename the file to something simpler like “twrp.img”.
Step 4: In the same command prompt window that was used in Step 1 to unlock the bootloader of the One M9, enter the following command:
adb devices
Note: Mac owners, make sure to prefix a “./” before executing any fastboot or ADB command.

This command will confirm whether the One M9 is being successfully detected by the computer or laptop it is connected to or not.
Proceed to reboot the handset into fastboot mode by entering the following command:
adb reboot bootloader
Once the device boots into the bootloader mode, use the Volume keys to navigate to the fastboot option and confirm the selection by pressing the Power key.
Step 5: Now, enter the following commands one by one:
fastboot flash recovery twrp.img
fastboot reboot 
If all the steps mentioned above were followed properly, TWRP recovery must have been successfully installed on the One M9.
Step 6: Once the recovery has been installed, it is now time to gain root access on the One M9 by flashing SueprSU. Switch off the handset once again and proceed to reboot it into bootloader mode by pressing the Volume Down + Power button simultaneously. Then, navigate to the Recovery option using the volume keys and confirm the selection by pressing the Power button.

After the One M9 has boot into recovery, tap the ‘Install’ button and select the SuperSU ZIP file. Once the ZIP file has been installed, reboot the handset by selecting the ‘Reboot system’ now button.
The first boot after installing SuperSU might take some time as Android OS needs to rebuild cache for some of the apps. After the device has booted back into Android, open the SuperSU app to make sure that it does not need to update its binary. If not, then the One M9 has been successfully rooted.
Since there is a custom recovery installed on the handset as well, installing a custom ROM down the line — if the user wishes to — will be easier as well.
