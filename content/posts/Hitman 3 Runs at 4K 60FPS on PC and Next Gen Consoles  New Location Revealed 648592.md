Gamers, get ready to enter a world of assassination like never before, as the latest installment of the Hitman series, Hitman 3, has unveiled an absolutely epic new location that will blow your mind away. The best part? The game comes with stunning 4K 60FPS gameplay, both on PC and next-gen consoles, making the experience even more immersive and engaging than ever before.

So, what is this new location all about? Hitman 3 takes you on a tour of the world's most exotic and dangerous locations as Agent 47, the ultimate assassin.

The China location features a unique modern skyscraper called the "Zhongli Tower," which is effectively the game's centerpiece. The tower is divided into multiple sections, each with its own unique design and function. The highest levels of the tower are reserved for VIP guests, such as politicians and business tycoons, while lower levels are for workers and staff.

According to IO Interactive, the developer of the Hitman series, the Zhongli Tower's design and layout have been inspired by real-world buildings like the Shanghai Tower, the Shard in London, and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. They have also included additional unique features and security measures like the iconic "cleaning robot" to make the challenges even more tricky and your pursuit of perfection that much harder.

The China location is expected to rival some of the best locations of the previous games, such as the luxurious Sapienza in Italy or the enchanting Marrakesh in Morocco. With the additional dimension of 4K 60FPS gameplay, it will truly be a feast for the senses. The gameplay in Hitman 3 has always been highly appreciated by gamers worldwide, and the new location promises not to disappoint.

The next-gen console version of the game has already received praise for its enhanced visuals, improved load times, and overall performance. The 4K 60FPS gameplay is expected to enhance the experience even further. With this version, players will be able to feel the adrenaline rush and thrill of the game, and every move and action will be sharper and smoother than ever before.

Moreover, IO Interactive has also promised to improve the lighting, textures, and overall performance on the PC version of the game. PC gamers can expect a smoother and optimized experience for their game. The addition of 4K 60FPS enhanced gameplay is a significant bonus for gamers who want to immerse themselves in the world of assassination.

To sum up, the Hitman series has always delivered top-notch gameplay and unique locations to its fans worldwide.
