# Unlock the Secret to Running Multiple Instagram Accounts on Android Like a Pro in 2020!

If you're an avid Instagram user, you know how difficult it is to manage multiple accounts with just one login.

Thankfully, Instagram has provided a way for users to run multiple accounts on Android devices. In this article, we will be discussing how to unlock the secret to running multiple Instagram accounts like a pro in 2020.

## Step 1: Update Your Instagram App

Before you proceed any further, make sure you've updated your Instagram app to the latest version available. The multiple accounts feature was added in version 7.15 of Instagram, so make sure you're running at least this version.

## Step 2: Add an Account

Once you've updated your app, you can add additional accounts by following these simple steps:

1. Go to your profile in the Instagram app and tap the triple-dot icon in the top right corner.
2. Scroll down and tap "Add Account".
3. Enter the login credentials for the account you wish to add.

You can add up to six accounts on Instagram, and you can switch between them easily by tapping your username at the top of your profile and then selecting the account you want to switch to.

## Step 3: Enable Notifications

Now that you have multiple accounts, you need to make sure you're receiving notifications for each one. Here's how:

1. Go to your profile in the Instagram app and tap the triple-dot icon in the top right corner.
2. Scroll down and tap "Settings".
3. Scroll down and tap "Notifications".
4. Tap "Activity" and then toggle on the notifications you want to receive for each account.

## Step 4: Organize Your Accounts

It's important to keep your multiple Instagram accounts organized to avoid confusion. Here are some tips:

1. Use different usernames and profile pictures for each account.
2. Keep the content of each account separate by posting on different days or at different times.
3. Use different hashtags and tags to distinguish each account's content from the others.

## Step 5: Use a Third-Party App

If you find it difficult to manage multiple Instagram accounts using the native app, you can use a third-party app like Hootsuite or Later. These apps allow you to manage all your accounts in one place, schedule posts, and monitor engagement.

In conclusion, running multiple Instagram accounts on Android is easy as long as you follow these steps. By enabling notifications and keeping your accounts organized, you'll be able to handle all your accounts like a pro. Good luck!
