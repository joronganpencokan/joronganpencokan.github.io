But for many gamers, the game comes with its own set of challenges - specifically, the Dweller in Darkness boss. This boss has proven to be a formidable opponent for many, leaving players frustrated and seeking help to advance to the next level. Fear not, for we have the ultimate secret on how to beat the Dweller in Darkness!

Firstly, it is important to understand the Dweller in Darkness's strengths and weaknesses. This boss has the ability to cause massive damage to your characters, making quick work of them if you're not careful. However, the Dweller in Darkness is also susceptible to certain types of attacks, namely fire and ice attacks.

When the battle against the Dweller in Darkness commences, you'll start by facing a swarm of enemies. It is crucial to defeat these enemies as quickly as possible, as they can deal significant damage to your characters while providing the Dweller in Darkness with the opportunity to launch its own attacks.

Once you've defeated the swarm of enemies, the Dweller in Darkness will reveal its true form. At this point, it is vital to focus your attacks on the Dweller in Darkness's legs. By doing so, you will weaken the Dweller in Darkness and render it more vulnerable to your attacks.

As mentioned earlier, the Dweller in Darkness is weak to fire and ice attacks. Equip your characters with weapons that have these elements and use them to deal maximum damage to the boss. Additionally, you should make use of your character's unique abilities - such as Star-Lord's gravity bomb or Gamora's stun grenade - to stun and damage the Dweller in Darkness.

It is important to note that the Dweller in Darkness has a few tricks up its sleeve. The boss has the ability to generate shock waves that can deal significant damage to your characters. Keep an eye out for these shock waves and dodge them by jumping or rolling.

Finally, be patient and persistent. The Dweller in Darkness is a tough boss that may require multiple attempts to defeat. Don't be discouraged if you're not successful on your first try. Keep trying, and with each attempt, you'll learn something new about the boss's patterns and moves, bringing you one step closer to victory.

In conclusion, the Dweller in Darkness may be a terrifying boss, but it is not unbeatable. By utilizing fire and ice attacks, focusing on the Dweller in Darkness's legs, and using your character's abilities to stun and damage the boss, you'll be well on your way to defeating this formidable opponent. Stay alert for shock waves and be patient, and victory will be yours!

## How to beat the Dweller-In-Darkness in Marvel’s Guardian of the Galaxy?
 

 
The boss fight will take place in 2 distinct phases. Hence, I will split up the boss fight accordingly. This will help you understand the tactics better and allow you to get through the fight quicker.
 
### Boss Fight Phase 1
 
The first phase of the fight will have you fight the tentacles of the Dweller-In-Darkness. Dweller will attack with its tentacles and occasionally slam them into the ground. Just make sure that you keep moving around in order to avoid damage. Anytime you aim with your gun, the aim will lock onto the tentacle. Now, all you have to do is keep spamming attacks at the tentacles. This is phase 1 of the Guardians of the Galaxy Dweller-In-Darkness boss fight.
 
Once the tentacle is damaged enough, the Dweller will get stunned and drop its tentacle into a pool of gel. Quite handy that the pool of gel just happens to be there at that point. Now, freeze the pool of gel and ask Gamora to sever the tentacle. You will have to keep doing this again with all the tentacles that the Dweller throws at you. Once you defeat the tentacles four times you will complete the 1st phase of the boss fight.
 
### Guardians Of The Galaxy Dweller-In-Darkness Boss Fight Phase 2
 
In this part of the fight, there will be several extra enemies that you will come across. These enemies are encased in cubes of an ooze-like substance. They will just randomly drop all over the map.
 
To defeat these enemies you will have to unfreeze them beforehand. While this happens the Dweller will drop a bomb right in front of you. When this happens, you will get a button prompt that will ask Drax to freeze and pick up the bomb. Now, Drax will also throw the bomb at the Dweller.
 
You will have to do this repeatedly till the Dweller’s health goes down. Once it is sufficiently low, Gamora will make the final attack. This will finish off the boss.
