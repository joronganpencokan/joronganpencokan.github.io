4. Don't retaliate. Responding to online bullies can encourage further harassment, and it may be seen as provocative. Instead, ignore the bully and take steps to protect yourself.

5. Document evidence. Keep screenshots of any abusive messages or posts from the bully. This evidence may be useful in making a formal complaint if the situation escalates.
