# Unlock the Secret to a Productive Life with Outlook's Focused Inbox for iOS!

Outlook's Focused Inbox is one of the features that sets this app apart from other email clients. It helps you prioritize your emails so that you can focus on the ones that matter most. Especially for busy professionals, it can be a game-changer in terms of productivity. And now, with its iOS app, Outlook's Focused Inbox is even more accessible and convenient.

If you're not familiar with Outlook's Focused Inbox, it's a feature that automatically filters your emails into two categories: "Focused" and "Other." Focused emails are the ones that are most likely to be important to you, while Other emails are the ones that are less important or spammy. The AI-powered system adapts over time based on your email usage patterns and learns which emails to prioritize.

So how can you take advantage of this feature on the go with Outlook's iOS app? Here's what you need to know:

## Step 1: Download and Install the App

If you haven't already, download the Outlook app from the App Store. It's free and available for both iPhone and iPad. Once you've installed the app, enter your email and password to access your account.

## Step 2: Set Up Focused Inbox

By default, Focused Inbox should be enabled in your Outlook account. However, if it's not, or if you want to customize the feature, you can adjust the settings by following these steps:

1. Open the Outlook app on your iOS device.
2. Tap the hamburger menu in the top-left corner of the screen.
3. Scroll down to "Settings," then tap "Focused Inbox."
4. Toggle the switch next to "Focused Inbox" to turn it on or off.
5. Choose whether you want new email notifications and sounds for Focused Inbox emails only or for all emails.
6. Customize your notification settings (optional).

## Step 3: Start Using Focused Inbox

Once you've set up Focused Inbox in your Outlook app, you can start using it to streamline your email management. Here are some tips to help you get the most out of this feature:

- Swipe right on an email in your inbox to mark it as "Focused" or "Other." This will help the AI-powered system learn your preferences over time.
- Tap the "Focused" or "Other" tabs at the top of the inbox to view only those emails. You can easily switch back and forth as needed.
- Pin important emails to the top of your inbox by swiping left and tapping the pin icon.
- Use the "Sweep" feature to delete or archive multiple emails at once. You can also set up "Sweep Rules" to automatically perform certain actions on incoming emails.

By taking advantage of these features in your Outlook app, you can ensure that your email management is as efficient as possible. You'll be able to quickly identify and respond to important emails, while also keeping your inbox clutter-free.

In conclusion, if you're looking to increase your productivity and take control of your email, Outlook's Focused Inbox is a great tool to have at your disposal. And with the iOS app, you can use this feature on the go, no matter where you are. Give it a try and see how much of a difference it can make in your daily routine!

##   Turn Focused Inbox On or Off in Outlook for iOS  
 

The Outlook for iOS Focused Inbox puts important emails in a special inbox tab and opens to that tab automatically. Based on how you use email, Outlook for iOS sorts your email into either the Focused Inbox or the Other Inbox. To choose whether you want Outlook for iOS to guess what emails are most important to you and move these messages to the Focused Inbox:

 
- Go to Settings (gear icon).
 - Turn on the Focused Inbox toggle switch if you want to use this feature. Turn off the Focused Inbox toggle switch to use a single inbox.
 - Close the Settings screen.

 
##   Move a Message to the Focused Tab  
 

To move an important email that Outlook for iOS put in the Other Inbox:

 
Email from people you email frequently appear in the Focused Inbox. Newsletters that you delete immediately go to the Other Inbox.
 

Go to Settings (gear icon).

 

Turn on the Focused Inbox toggle switch if you want to use this feature. Turn off the Focused Inbox toggle switch to use a single inbox.

 

Close the Settings screen.

 
- Open the message you want to mark important and move to the Focused Inbox.
 - Select Menu (...).
 - Select Move to Focused Inbox.
 - If you want future messages from the same sender to be moved to the Focused Inbox automatically, select Always Move.
 - If you want to move only this message (and not set up a rule for the future), select Move Once.

 
##   Move a Message to the Other Tab  
 

While Outlook learns your email habits, some emails that are important may go to the Other Inbox folder. When this happens, move the message to the Focused Inbox to teach Outlook what you want it to do. And, if junk emails appear in the Focused Inbox, move those messages to the Other Inbox. When you move individual misplaced emails, Outlook for iOS prompts you to set up a rule to accomplish just that for future emails.

 

Open the message you want to mark important and move to the Focused Inbox.

 

Select Menu (...).

 

Select Move to Focused Inbox.

 

If you want future messages from the same sender to be moved to the Focused Inbox automatically, select Always Move.

 

If you want to move only this message (and not set up a rule for the future), select Move Once.

 

To move an email Outlook for iOS put in the Focused Inbox when you do not want to focus on it:

 
- Open the email you want to move to the Other Inbox.
 - Select Menu (...).
 - Select Move to Other.
 - If you want future messages from the same sender to be moved to the Other Inbox automatically, select Always Move.
 - If you want to move only this message (and not set up a rule for the future), select Move Once.

 

Open the email you want to move to the Other Inbox.

 

Select Move to Other.

 

If you want future messages from the same sender to be moved to the Other Inbox automatically, select Always Move.

 
Only the current email and future messages are moved. Other emails from the same sender that already are in the Focused Inbox will stay there.
