As cyber threats continue to evolve, it has become more critical to establish a secure connection when accessing remote servers or devices. One way to do this is by using the OpenSSH client, which provides encrypted communication channels for secure data transfer between systems. In this article, we will guide you through the process of installing OpenSSH Client on Windows 10.

## What is OpenSSH Client?

OpenSSH is a suite of secure networking tools that provides secure encrypted communication channels between two untrusted systems. It uses public-key cryptography to authenticate remote computers and encrypt communications. The OpenSSH Client is a program that establishes a secure connection to a remote server and allows you to securely transfer files or execute commands on that server.

## Steps to Install OpenSSH Client on Windows 10

Here are the steps to follow in installing OpenSSH Client on Windows 10:

### Step 1: Enable OpenSSH Client Feature

Before you can install OpenSSH Client, make sure that the feature is enabled on your Windows 10 computer. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the Start Menu and type "Turn Windows features on or off" in the search bar.
2. Click on the "Turn Windows features on or off" option from the search results.
3. Check the box next to "OpenSSH Client" and click on the "OK" button.
4. Wait for the feature to be installed, which may take a few minutes.

### Step 2: Download and Install OpenSSH Client

Once you have enabled the OpenSSH Client feature, you can now download and install the client. Here are the steps:

1. Go to the OpenSSH Client official website (https://www.openssh.com/windows.html) and download the latest version of the OpenSSH Client for Windows.
2. After downloading, double-click on the downloaded file to start the installation process.
3. Follow the installation wizard to complete the installation process.

### Step 3: Verify OpenSSH Client Installation

After installing the OpenSSH Client on your Windows 10 computer, you can verify that it is installed and working correctly by opening a command prompt and typing:

```
ssh -V
```

If OpenSSH is installed correctly, you should see the version number displayed in the command prompt.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have now installed OpenSSH Client on your Windows 10 computer, which allows you to establish a secure connection and protect your network from potential cyber threats. With this program, you can remotely access servers, transfer files, and execute commands securely. It's a powerful tool that every Windows user should have in their arsenal. We hope that this article has helped you in your journey towards a more secure online experience.

If you’re a network administrator, developer, or someone hosting a website in the cloud, you’ve probably been using tools like Putty on Windows 10 to connect to your server using Secure Shell (SSH), which works fine, but you no longer need to rely on third-party tools as the Fall Creators Update now includes a ported version of OpenSSH.
 
What’s Secure Shell? In case you’re unfamiliar, SSH is a networking protocol similar to Telnet and FTP that allows you to transmit data from one computer to another, but unlike other protocols, this one transmits information securely using encryption. OpenSSH is a popular app in the Linux community as it allows you to connect and manage a remote server using the SSH protocol as if you’re sitting in front of it.
 
In this guide, you’ll learn the steps to install OpenSSH on a PC running the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update using the Settings app “Optional features,” and installing the Ubuntu distro.

## How to install OpenSSH using Settings
 
Installing the OpenSSH package directly into Windows 10 allows to use Command Prompt to connect a remote server using SSH as if it was a native component of Windows.
 
- Open Settings.
 - Click on Apps.
 - Click on Apps & features.
 - Under “Apps & features,” click the Manage optional features link.
 - Apps & features settings

You can always start the client by launching a Command Prompt session, and running the ssh command to use OpenSSH.
 
## How to install OpenSSH using Ubuntu
 
Alternatively, you can install the Ubuntu distro for Windows 10 that already includes OpenSSH. (You’ll be using the same commands using Command Prompt on Windows 10 or using the Ubuntu console, so it doesn’t really matter which method you use.)
 
### Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux
 
- Open Start.
 - Search for Windows Features, in the result, and click Turn Windows features on or off.
 - Check the Windows System for Linux option.
