# Unlock the Secret Trick to Never Losing Your Parking Spot in Maps Again!

For most people, finding a parking spot in a busy city can be a daunting task. You drive around the block, hoping to find a spot, and when you do find one, you forget where you parked your car. It's frustrating and time-consuming, but luckily, Google Maps has a secret trick that can help.

The trick is called the “Parking Location” feature, and it's been available on Google Maps for some time now. This feature helps you keep track of where you parked your car, so you don't end up wandering around the streets aimlessly searching for it.

To use this feature, all you have to do is park your car, open Google Maps on your phone, and tap the blue dot that indicates your current location. A pop-up menu will appear with the “Save your parking” option. Tap on it, and Google Maps will save the location of your car.

When you need to find your car again, open Google Maps, and tap on the blue dot again. In the menu that appears, you will see the option “Parking Location” and tapping on it will take you to the location where you parked your car.

This feature is especially helpful if you're in a new city or a place you're not familiar with. It allows you to focus on your day without worrying about where you parked your car.

Another feature that can help you find parking spots is the “Find Parking” feature in Google Maps. It shows you parking lots and garages near your location so you can easily find a spot. It's particularly useful in busy areas where street parking may be scarce.

To use this feature, simply open Google Maps and search for the destination you're heading to. Then tap on the directions icon and select the car icon. You'll be shown a list of parking lots and garages near your destination. You can select one that suits you and get directions to it.

In conclusion, Google Maps is much more than just a navigation and mapping tool. With the “Parking Location” and “Find Parking” features, you can easily find your parking spot and available parking lots around you. It's a simple trick that can save you a lot of time and frustration in the long run.
