# Revolutionize Your Linux Operating System: Learn How to Install Software Effortlessly Using the Command Line on Multiple Linux Distributions!

Are you tired of the slow and tedious process of installing software on your Linux computer? Do you want to learn how to install applications effortlessly using the command line? This article will show you how to transform the way you install software on multiple Linux distributions using the power of the command line interface.

Installing software on Linux is often seen as a daunting task, especially for those who are new to the operating system. Many users are still stuck downloading installation files from the internet, double-clicking on them, and waiting for the installation process to complete. This method is slow, prone to error, and may even lead to security risks. However, there is a better way to install software on Linux, and that is through the command line interface.

The command line interface (CLI) is a text-based way of interacting with the Linux operating system. It allows you to input commands and execute them by pressing enter. The CLI is much faster than traditional graphical user interfaces (GUI), like those found in Windows and macOS, and can perform more advanced operations.

Installing software using the CLI is not as complicated as it may seem. You can easily install software by typing a single command into the terminal. For example, to install VLC Media Player on Ubuntu, simply open the terminal and type:

```
sudo apt install vlc
```

and press enter. The terminal will ask for your password and then proceed to download and install VLC Media Player. No need to search for the software online or find the right download link. The command will automatically install the latest version of VLC Media Player for Ubuntu.

The above command only works on Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distributions. If you’re using a different distribution, like Fedora or openSUSE, you’ll have to use a different command to install software. Here’s a table of some common Linux distributions and their package managers:

| Distribution | Package Manager | Command to Install Software |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ubuntu/Debian | APT | `sudo apt install software_name` |
| Fedora | DNF | `sudo dnf install software_name` |
| Arch Linux | Pacman | `sudo pacman -S software_name` |
| openSUSE | Zypper | `sudo zypper install software_name` |

The above commands are just a starting point. There are many more commands and options available for installing software using the command line interface. You can install packages from third-party repositories, exclude certain packages from being installed, and even choose specific versions of a package to install.

Using the command line interface to install software has many advantages. For one, it’s much faster than the traditional method of downloading and installing software. You don’t have to wait for the installation wizard to start up, nor do you have to click through numerous screens to install the software. Secondly, it’s more secure than downloading software from the internet. The package manager checks to make sure that the software is from a trusted source, and you can be sure that it’s free from malware or viruses.

In conclusion, if you’re tired of the slow and error-prone process of installing software on Linux, it’s time to learn how to install software using the command line interface. Not only is it faster and more secure, but it’s also a powerful tool that can perform many advanced operations. So, give the CLI a chance and revolutionize the way you install software on your Linux operating system.

When it comes to Linux, there are tons of Linux distributions to choose from. Some are popular and used by many people, some just disappear not long after they are released to the public. For installing software in these distributions, most come with a software center where you can install (or remove) software easily, but internally they are using a different architecture from each other, and installing software via the command line is different for different distros.
 
The distributions listed below are the most popular. Even more distributions are derived from these, so learning this list of install commands will allow you to install software on nearly any Linux distribution that you’ll encounter.
 
## Ubuntu/Debian
 

 
Debian is the ancestor of a huge chunk of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, and just about all of them use the Apt package manager. Installing packages with Apt only requires that you tell it to install and specify the name of the package.
 
## Fedora
 
Fedora is the first of the Red Hat family of distributions to adopt the new DNF package manager. It will probably be picked up by RHEL and CentOS in the 8.0 release. DNF behaves a lot like the old YUM package manager and is very easy to use. Tell it to install and which package to grab.
 
## CentOS/RHEL
 
CentOS and RHEL use the old YUM package manager. It works the same, though. Tell it what to install.
 
## OpenSUSE
 
OpenSUSE uses the RPM package format like the Red Hat distributions do, but it uses its own package manager – Zypper. Zypper allows you to tell it to install, or you can shorten it to in.
 
or
 
## Arch Linux
 
Arch Linux has its own package manager, called Pacman. Pacman isn’t really like the others. It was written just for Arch with a focus on simplicity. Pacman uses flags instead of words to specify an action. To install, use the -S flag.
 
## Gentoo
 
Gentoo is yet another step away from the norm. It uses the Portage package manager. Portage is something entirely different because Gentoo is a source-based distribution. It doesn’t have compiled packages. It pulls the source code of a program and compiles it on demand, so Portage is essentially a gigantic unified install script. To install a package with Portage, use the emerge command.
 
## Void Linux
 
Void Linux is sort of an odd newcomer to the Linux world, but it’s showing some real promise to be a top distribution in the future. Void is not a descendant of any existing distribution. Instead, the creators of Void built their distribution from the ground up, picking the software that they wanted to include.
 
As a result, Void has its own package manager, XBPS, that behaves a lot like Arch’s Pacman, is still very much a different system. Like Pacman, XBPS uses flags, but in this case it includes the “install” keyword in the command as well.
 
## Solus
 
Solus is another fairly new distribution. It actually aims to be one of the few stable rolling release distributions in the Linux ecosystem. Oddly, Solus is not geared for servers at all.
 
Instead, the Solus developers have devoted all of their efforts to making Solus the best desktop distribution possible. Solus also has its own package manager, Eopkg.  Eopkg feels and behaves a lot like Debian’s Apt. Tell it to install and what needs to be installed.
 
## Closing Thoughts
 
Any one of these package management systems is great. They all have their nuances that only using them for a stretch of time will prepare you for. There is also a lot more depth to these. Most, if not all, of them are capable of managing all of the software on your system.
 
That means that they can remove and reconfigure packages as well as update everything all at once. On some distributions, like Debian and Ubuntu, you can upgrade the entire system to the latest release through the package manager.
 
Once you’ve settled on a distribution, take the time to learn the package manager thoroughly. It will save you a lot of headaches in the future, and it can become one of your greatest assets in configuring your system exactly how you like it.
