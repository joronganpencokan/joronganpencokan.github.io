First and foremost, make sure you have the latest update of the Uber application which will allow you to summon an Uber ride 15 minutes to 30 days (Yes, really!) in advance. The booking process is quite straightforward – Select either an uberGO or uberX (in India) from the slider down below and you’ll see a new “schedule a ride” option, tap that. You’ll be redirected to the page where you can specify details including pickup date and location, time of arrival, destination, and payment method. Once done, a generated fare estimate will be visible down below and while selecting the time, Uber will also tell you the estimated period of arrival. Lastly, hit the “Schedule” button for confirmation.

In case you would like to cancel, Uber currently allows abandoning a ride free of cost before the driver is on the way. Additionally, you’ll receive reminders both 24 hours and 30 minutes in advance of your pickup and whether dynamic surge pricing is applicable or not during that time. This feature as of now is available in selected regions, hence you might not see the option based on the location. That’s all you need to know about scheduling cabs on Uber.
Letting users schedule rides will definitely elevate Uber’s sales as this was indeed one of the most demanded features. It will be interesting to see how other cab companies tackle this, however, Uber is also not exclusively assigning a driver for you at the specified time, it will look for the closest driver at the moment. Hence, alike others, Uber’s attempt to pre-book rides might not also take off.
