Firefox Hack Revealed: Secret Trick to Copy Links like a Pro!

Are you tired of the hassle of copying links from web pages manually? Do you want to become a pro at copying links with just a few clicks? Well, you're in luck because a new Firefox hack has been revealed that makes copying links easier than ever before.

The hack involves using the "Copy Link Text" Firefox add-on, which can be downloaded for free from the Firefox Add-ons Store. This add-on enables you to copy the link of any text on a web page quickly and easily.

To use the hack, all you need to do is select the text with the link you want to copy, right-click on the selected text, and choose the "Copy Link Text" option. Once you've done that, you can then paste the link wherever you want it.

One of the benefits of this hack is that you don't need to open the link in a new tab or window, which can save you a lot of time and effort, especially if you're copying lots of links. It's also useful because it enables you to copy links that aren't displayed in a traditional hyperlink format. For example, you may want to copy a URL that's embedded in an image or a piece of text that looks like a heading rather than a link.

The "Copy Link Text" add-on is easy to use, and it's compatible with all versions of Firefox, including the latest version. It's also customizable, so you can tweak it to suit your preferences. For example, you can choose to have the add-on display a notification when a link is copied, or you can set it up to copy the link automatically without any user interaction.

So if you want to become a pro at copying links like a champ, give the "Copy Link Text" Firefox hack a try today. It's a quick and easy way to streamline your workflow and save time when you're working with links on the web.

When browsing articles and blogs on the web, you may want to copy a headline or a phrase that has a link. Usually, when following the usual copy-and-paste method, the highlighted phrase will paste along with the link, especially when you paste it into a word processor or an HTML editor. This can be an annoyance, particularly when you only want to copy and paste the text and not the link.
 
While there are many workarounds to this, there is a quicker, easier approach to the problem. Instead of copying and pasting text with links and then removing them later, there’s a way to remove the link before you start copying.
 
A Firefox add-on called Link Stun enables you to temporarily disable links in highlighted text so you can copy and paste them as plain text. Here’s how it works:
 
1. First, you’ll have to download and install the add-on. After installing, you’ll need to restart Firefox.
 
Once restarted, you may browse into a web page of your choice and activate Link Stun using the context menu.
 
2. Right-click on the text you want to copy, and select “Link Stun”. This will immediately clear out any links associated with the highlighted text. You will notice that a cursor appears when you hover over the text instead of an arrow. This means that the text can now be copied without including the link.
 

 
Also, any font style that applies for a linked text will disappear when selecting Link Stun. For instance, a link in Wikipedia entries is usually in blue. When Link Stun is activated, the text becomes black.
 
3. Highlight the text and copy and paste as normal.
 
This is how the text looked when pasted to a Word file:
 
It should be noted, though, that the copied text will still maintain formatting properties, i.e., font size and style. You will need to manually change this should you need a different text format.
 
Link Stun is particularly useful when removing links from footnotes before copying them into your own text document. It’s also handy when you need to copy a long list of text without copying the links as well, such as a database or archive page.
 
While there isn’t a way to “stun” multiple links in one go, this is still possible by manually disabling links one by one. This lessens the convenience, but it’s well worth the effort.
 
There’s also no option in the context menu to re-enable the links. You would have to reload the page to get the links back into the text.
 
Link Stun is a quick fix for removing unwanted links in text for more convenient copying, but it does need quite a few improvements. It’s not flexible and advanced, but it does get the job done, and it’s easy to do. If you ever, at some point, want to remove links from text as easily and as fast as possible, this add-on is one of the best ways to do it.
