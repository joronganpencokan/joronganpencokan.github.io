# Your iPhone has been secretly sabotaging you! Learn how to take back control with this simple trick to make Google Maps your default.

Are you tired of being constrained by Apple Maps every time you try to navigate somewhere? Do you find yourself getting lost or stuck in traffic because of the app's poor directions? If so, you are not alone. Apple Maps has been a source of frustration for many iPhone users since its introduction in 2012. However, there is hope! By following this simple trick, you can take back control and make Google Maps your default on your iPhone.

## Step One: Download Google Maps

The first step to making Google Maps your default is, of course, downloading the app. If you haven't already done so, head over to the App Store and download the Google Maps app. Once it's installed, open the app and sign in to your Google account, if prompted. This will allow you to save your favorite places, see your search history, and receive personalized recommendations.

## Step Two: Remove Apple Maps from Your Home Screen

By default, Apple Maps is the app that appears on your iPhone's home screen when you tap the Maps icon. To change this, you'll need to remove the Apple Maps app from your home screen. To do this, press and hold the Maps icon until the icon starts to wiggle. Then, tap the "x" in the upper-left corner of the icon to remove it from your home screen. Note that this will not delete the app from your iPhone; you can still access it by searching for it in the App Store.

## Step Three: Set Google Maps as Your Default

Now that you've downloaded Google Maps and removed Apple Maps from your home screen, the final step is to set Google Maps as your default. To do this, open the Google Maps app and tap the "Directions" button at the bottom of the screen. From there, enter the start and end points of the route you want to take. When you're ready to start navigating, tap "Start." You should now be taken to the full-screen view of Google Maps, with turn-by-turn directions and a blue dot showing your current location.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully taken back control of your iPhone's navigation system. From now on, when you tap the Maps icon on your home screen, you'll be taken directly to Google Maps, rather than Apple Maps. This simple trick will save you time, frustration, and most importantly, get you to your destination on time and hassle-free. So go ahead and take Google Maps for a spin on your iPhone; you won't regret it!
