Title: Unlock the Secret to a Blissful Twitter Experience - Learn How to Mute Users and Create Muted Words List like a Pro!

Are you tired of seeing tweets that irritate you, make you roll your eyes, or lead to endless arguments on Twitter? Do you want to filter out certain types of content or avoid interacting with certain users without having to unfollow them? If so, you need to learn how to mute users and create a muted words list like a pro!

Twitter can be a great tool for networking, learning, and sharing thoughts and ideas. However, with millions of users and a constant influx of tweets, it's easy to get overwhelmed, distracted, or annoyed by the noise and clutter. Fortunately, Twitter provides several features that can help you tailor your experience and focus on what matters most to you. One of these features is muting.

Muting allows you to hide tweets from specific users or containing certain keywords, phrases, or hashtags. When you mute a user, their tweets won't appear in your timeline, notifications, mentions, or DMs. However, the user can still follow you, see your tweets, and interact with you. When you mute a word, any tweet that contains that word won't show up in your timeline or notifications, but you can still search for it or see it on other people's timelines.

Muting users and words can save you a lot of time, energy, and stress on Twitter. For example, if you're tired of seeing political rants from a particular user, you can mute them without hurting their feelings or risking a confrontation. If you want to avoid spoilers for a show or movie, you can mute the name or hashtag of the show without missing out on other topics. If you're sensitive to certain triggers or topics, you can mute them to protect your mental health and well-being.

To mute a user on Twitter, simply go to their profile, click on the three-dots icon next to their name, and choose "Mute" from the drop-down menu. You can also mute them from their tweet by clicking on the three-dots icon and selecting "Mute @username." To mute a word or phrase, go to your settings and privacy, click on "Content Preferences," and select "Muted Words." Then, add the word or phrase you want to mute, choose where you want to apply it, and set the duration and notifications.

By using muting strategically, you can create a blissful Twitter experience that aligns with your values, interests, and goals. However, keep in mind that muting is not the same as blocking, which completely restricts a user's access to your account. Muting also doesn't prevent you from seeing a user's replies, retweets, or quotes from other users, nor does it stop them from seeing your tweets or interacting with you indirectly.

To make the most of muting, you need to experiment, refine, and update your mute list regularly. Start by identifying the types of tweets or users that bother you the most and add them to your mute list. Then, pay attention to your timeline and notifications to see if you miss anything important or if you need to fine-tune your criteria. You can also use third-party tools like TweetDeck or Hootsuite to create more complex and flexible muting rules.

In conclusion, muting is a powerful and underutilized feature on Twitter that can enhance your well-being and productivity. By learning how to mute users and create a muted words list like a pro, you can filter out the noise and distractions and focus on the content and connections that matter. So, start muting, and enjoy your blissful Twitter experience!

The Twitter mute feature is designed to control the content that appears in your Twitter timeline, filter your notifications, and protect you from internet trolls and online harassment.

 
##   What Happens When You Mute Someone on Twitter?  
 

When you mute someone on Twitter, they continue to see tweets posted by the account that muted them and can like, retweet, and comment on them. Muted users can also send a DM, or direct message, to you.

 

While a muted account can interact with your Twitter account, Twitter hides these interactions from you. You won't see their likes, retweets, or comments in your Twitter notifications or DMs from them in your Twitter inbox.

 
##   How to Mute Someone on Twitter  
 

You can mute another user on Twitter from their profile or one of their tweets in your timeline. The following instructions work with the official Twitter apps on Windows 10, Android, and iOS devices, as well as the web version of Twitter in an internet browser.

 
Muted users count toward your total follower count (if they follow you), and their interactions with your tweets contribute to the total number of tweet likes and retweets.

##   How to Use the Twitter Muted Words List  
 

In addition to muting user accounts, you can mute words and phrases on Twitter by adding them to the Muted words list. After adding a word or phrase to your Muted words list, any tweet containing them is hidden from you when you view your timeline.

 
- Log in to Twitter and access your profile. Swipe right on the app or select More on the web and choose Settings and privacy.
 - Select Content preferences in the Twitter app. In a web browser, choose Mute and Block.
 - Select Muted.
 - Select Muted words.
 - Select Add to add a word or phrase to your Twitter Muted words list.

##   Who Has Muted Me on Twitter?  
 

Muted Twitter users don't know that they've been muted by someone else as the feature doesn't stop you from interacting with an account. It prevents the person who muted you from seeing your interactions with them.

 
While the Muted words list isn't case-sensitive, it doesn't account for word variations. For example, to mute all references to Spider-Man, add SpiderMan, Spiderman, and even Peter Parker as individual entries.
 
To unmute someone on Twitter, repeat the steps for how to mute someone, and then select Undo. If the target account has been muted, the Mute option appears as Unmute.
 
##   Who to Mute on Twitter  
 

Here are some reasons why you may choose to mute another Twitter user:

 
- An overenthusiastic follower: It's great to have loyal Twitter followers who like and retweet some of your tweets. However, if they like and retweet all your tweets, it can get overwhelming, and it can be a good idea to mute them. This way, they can still follow you and interact with your content, but you aren't notified every time they do so.
 - Internet trolls: Blocking internet trolls for harassing you online can seem like a logical solution until the trolls realize they've been blocked by viewing your Twitter profile. Muting these toxic accounts is the best option. They'll have no idea you can't see their interactions, so they won't create duplicate accounts or contact you on other social networks or by email.
 - Friends and family: As much as you love your friends and family, you may not want to see their political or opinionated tweets in your Twitter timeline. Unfollowing or blocking them could cause untold drama, so muting is the way to go. They'll still see you as following their account, and you won't see anything they tweet.

 
##   Are Mute and Block the Same on Twitter?  
 

Muting someone on Twitter lets the user see and interact with your tweets but hides their interactions from you. Blocking someone hides their interactions from you and prevents them from viewing your tweets, media, and profile.

 

Users can't tell when you mute them. However, blocked Twitter users can tell because Twitter notifies them of their blocked status when they view your profile or send you a DM.
