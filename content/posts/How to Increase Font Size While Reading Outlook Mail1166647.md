Title: Boost Your Email Productivity with this One Simple Trick for Outlook Mail Font!

Introduction:
In today's fast-paced world, email has become an integral part of our work life. It is one of the fastest and most effective methods of communication. However, with the ever-increasing volume of mail, it becomes challenging to manage it all. One of the methods to improve your email productivity is by tweaking your Microsoft Outlook Mail settings to make your emails more presentable and readable. In this article, we will look at a simple trick to improve your font settings for Outlook Mail.

Step 1: Accessing the Fonts setting.
To tweak your Microsoft Outlook Mail settings, first, locate the ‘File’ option and click on it. Go to ‘Options’ and select ‘Mail’. Under the ‘Compose messages’ section, click on the ‘Stationery and Fonts’ option. This will bring up the ‘Personal Stationery’ dialog box.

Step 2: Setting up the new font style.
In the ‘Personal Stationery’ menu, click on ‘Font’. Here you can select the font style, size, and color for your email. Choose the font that suits your taste and preference. It is best to pick a font that is easy to read and professional-looking. We recommend using Arial or Calibri at a font size of 14 or 16. Adjust the font color to your liking.

Step 3: Save and Apply settings.
Once you have selected your font style, click on the ‘OK’ button to save the settings. The changes will be applied to all outgoing emails. It is worth noting that the font used in replies and forwards is subject to change depending on the original sender’s font settings.

Conclusion:
By following these three simple steps, you can improve your email productivity by making your email more presentable and readable to your recipients. This approach tells your recipient that you are a professional who cares about the details of your communication. Small tweaks in settings can help you communicate better and get more done in less time. In summary, improving your email settings can help you conquer the email overload and lead to better productivity.
