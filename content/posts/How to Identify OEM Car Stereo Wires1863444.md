Unleash Your Inner Mechanic: Super Easy Tricks to Identify OEM Car Stereo Wires!

Installing an aftermarket car stereo can be tricky if you don't understand the basics of wiring. However, identifying the OEM car stereo wires is a critical step in the process, and it can save you a lot of trouble. This article will help you unleash your inner mechanic with super easy tricks to identify OEM car stereo wires.

Step 1: Remove the Factory Stereo

The first step to identify OEM car stereo wires is to remove the factory stereo. You can do this by using a pry wrench or a flat screwdriver to remove the plastic trim around the stereo. Once you have removed the plastic trim, you will expose the screws that hold the stereo in place. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws and gently pull out the stereo. Be careful not to damage any wires.

Step 2: Locate the Wiring Harness

Once you have removed the factory stereo, locate the wiring harness at the back of the stereo. The wiring harness is a collection of wires that connect the stereo to the electrical system of the car. The wiring harness is usually located in the center of the back of the stereo.

Step 3: Identify the Wires

The wires in the wiring harness are color-coded, which means that each wire has a specific function. To identify the wires, you need to know what each color represents. Here is a quick guide to help you identify the wires:

Yellow: This wire connects to the battery and provides constant power to the stereo. It is known as the memory wire.

Red: This wire is the ignition wire and provides power to the stereo only when the key is turned on.

Black: This wire is the ground wire and helps to provide stability to the stereo.

Blue: This wire is used to connect an amplifier to the stereo.

Green and Purple: These wires are the rear speaker wires.

Gray and White: These wires are the front speaker wires. 

Step 4: Test the Wires

Once you have identified the wires, it is important to test them to ensure that they are working correctly. You can use a multimeter to test the wires, or you can use a simple test light. Testing the wires will help you to identify any problems and ensure that you have connected them correctly.

In conclusion, identifying OEM car stereo wires is essential for installing an aftermarket stereo, and it can save you a lot of time and trouble. With the tips discussed in this article, you can unleash your inner mechanic and identify the wires with ease. Remember to test the wires after identifying them to ensure that they are working correctly. Happy wiring!

This article explains how to identify wiring using the typical colors and a multimeter or simple light test.

 
##   Typical Power Inputs  
 

A head unitÂ usually has two or three power inputs, whether it's a car stereo, receiver, or tuner. One is hot all the time, and it's used for "memory keep-alive" functions such as presets and the clock. Another is hot only when the ignition key is on, which ensures the radio is off after you've taken the key out. A third wire, if present, powers a dimmer function for headlights and the dash light.

 
##   Check for the 12V Wire  
 

Set your multimeter to the appropriate scale, connect the ground lead to a known good ground, and touch the other lead to each wire in the speaker wire. When you find one that shows approximately 12V, you have found the constant 12V wire, also known as the memory wire. It's yellow in most aftermarket head units.

 
##   Check for the Dimmer and Accessory Wires  
 

After you mark the 12V wire and set it aside, turn on the ignition switch, turn on the headlights, and turn up the dimmer switch, if equipped, all the way. If you find two more wires that show approximately 12V, turn the dimmer switch down and check again.

 
- The wire that shows less than 12V at that point is the dimmer/illumination wire. It's typically orange or orange with a white stripe.The wire that still shows 12V is the accessory wire, which is usually red in aftermarket wiring harnesses. If only one wire ever had power in this step, it is the accessory wire.

 
##   Check for the Ground Wire  
 

With the power wires marked and out of the way, you can move on to checking for the ground wire. Ideally, the ground wire is grounded somewhere you can see, taking the guesswork out of the equation. Ground wires are also black more often than not but don't take that for granted.

 

If you can't locate the ground wire visually, use an ohmmeter. Just connect it to a known good ground, and then check each wire in the car stereo harness for continuity. The one that shows continuity is the ground.

 

You can also check for the ground wire with a test light, although using an ohmmeter is preferred.

 
##   Identify Speaker Wires  
 

Figuring out the speaker wires can be a little more complicated. If the remaining wires are in pairs, one a solid color and the other the same color with a line, then each pair typically goes to the same speaker. You can test this by connecting one wire in the pair to one end of your AA battery and the other end to the other terminal.

 

If a sound comes from one of the speakers, you have identified where those wires go, and you can repeat the process for the other three pairs. In most cases, the solid wire is positive, but that isn't always the case. To be certain, look at the speaker as you trigger it. If the cone appears to move inward, you have the polarity reversed.

 

If the wires aren't in matched sets, choose one, connect it to one terminal of your AA battery, and touch each of the remaining wires to the positive terminal in turn. This is a longer process, but it works just the same.

 
- Do I have to solder car stereo wires?
 - Not necessarily, however, soldering will give you the best connection for your car stereo. Just make sure you strip the wires adequately and use heat shrinking tubes to insulate the connection.
 - How do I hide car stereo wires?
 - When installing a new stereo, take advantage of the car structure. Hide wires under the carpet or behind the door panels. Depending on your dash, you might be able to tuck them inside.
