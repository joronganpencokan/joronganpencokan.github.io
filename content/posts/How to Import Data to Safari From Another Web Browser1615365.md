Safari for Mac has improved a lot in recent years, and people have actually begun to like this browser from Apple. Whether you are currently using Chrome or Firefox for your browsing needs on your Mac, you now have reasons to switch to Safari as your primary browser.
 
While switching to Safari is as easy as making it your default browser and doing all of your browsing work in it, you might have some data stored in your other web browsers that you would like to import to Safari.
 
Fortunately, Safari does have an option that helps you import data to the browser from your other browsers. The feature lets you import data like bookmarks, web browsing history, and saved passwords. These are the most common things you are going to need when you start your life with Safari.
 
## Import Data to Safari from Another Browser
 
You do not need a third-party app to do the job, as Safari’s import feature will do the job.
 
1. Launch Safari.
 
2. Click on the “File” menu on the top, and select “Import From.” Here you should be able to see all other browsers that are installed on your Mac.
 
You need to select the one that you want to import the data from by clicking on that browser’s name in the option list, such as Firefox.
 

 
3. Once you have selected a browser to import the browsing data from, you will be asked what data you would like imported.
 
The options that are available to you are:
 
Bookmarks – These are the bookmarks that you have saved in your other web browser. Checkmarking this option should bring over all of your bookmarks to Safari.
 
History – This is the list of the websites you have visited in your other browser.
 
Passwords – These are the passwords for various websites that you have saved in another browser. You should definitely import these so that you do not need to enter them again.
 
Once you are done selecting what data you want imported, click on the “Import” button to begin the import process.
 
4. Once the import process is done, all of the data options you checkmarked in the previous step should be available in Safari for you to use. You can check to confirm that everything has been imported over and nothing has been left behind.
 
5. Now that the data has been imported over to Safari, and you have decided to use this browser as your primary browser, you can go ahead and uninstall that other browser if you no longer need it.
 
## Conclusion
 
If you are switching to Safari as your primary browser, the guide above should help you migrate the data from other web browsers to your now-favorite browser, Safari.
