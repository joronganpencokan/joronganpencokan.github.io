Google unveiled a new demo video of the project Google Glass headset, offering a glance to the new user interface. The video, as reported by The Verge was released after the search giant announced its intentions to expand Glass pre-order program early on Wednesday.
 
Last year’s preview showed a more proof-of-concept view, but the new video that Google is offering this time provides more details on the functionality and what you could actually be able to do with the device.
 
Watching at the video suggests that users will be able control the device via voice-commands and record videos, take pictures, start a Google Hangout to video-chat, send and receive text messages and pictures, turn-by-turn directions (GPS) and much more. The new preview hints that Glass will also support on-screen translation.
 
The YouTube clip also shows Google Glass headset being used in different locations and weather. People who use the device are shown starting a new task by just saying “OK Glass” record a video or simply “Google” tiger heads.

Sometime ago the company started a pre-order program that was only available for developers and well-connected people (media). The glasses also had a price tag of $1,500, and although the price didn’t change, the search giant is now expanding the pre-order program for more people via a new contest.
 

 
To enter the contest “If I Had Glass” you must write 50 words or less on what you do, if you had a Google Glass. The entry has to be posted by February 27th, on Google+ or Twitter with the hashtag #ifihadglass. Once Google decides who wins, you’ll get one pre-production model of the device for free, but the catch is that you’ll need to pick up the glasses at one of the Google’s events in New York, Los Angeles or San Francisco — for more details visit the link above.
 
Update: Today, Feb. 22, 2013, The Verge reports that Google Glass will go on sale to the general public before the end of 2013. This is ahead of schedule to the 2014 date that Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, anticipated last year.
