Unleash The Ultimate PokéPower: The Top Secret Guide To Saving Your Android Battery While Playing Pokèmon Go!

Pokémon Go has taken the world by storm since its release in 2016. Millions of people have turned into Pokémon trainers, exploring their neighborhoods and local parks in search of the elusive pocket monsters. However, there is one major challenge that every player faces, and that is the battery drain caused by the game. With some smart tips and tricks, however, players can enjoy the game for longer hours without the need to rush to the power outlet or recharge their phone batteries. Here is the top-secret guide to saving your Android battery while playing Pokémon Go:

1. Activate the Power Saving Mode on Your Android Phone

Whether you realize it or not, your Android phone has a built-in battery saver mode. By activating this feature, your phone will automatically adjust to a mode that saves power. For example, your phone's screen will dim, and it will reduce the rate of all background activities. To activate this mode, go to your phone's "Settings" menu and click on "Battery." You should see an option that activates the "Power Saver" mode. While the Power Saving Mode is on, you may experience a slight reduction in performance, but this is a small price to pay for longer battery life.

2. Turn Off the Augmented Reality Feature

In Pokémon Go, the game's augmented reality feature allows players to view creatures as if they existed in the real world. It may be tempting to use this feature, but it has a massive battery drain. Turning it off will help you conserve your battery life by reducing the amount of power your device requires to run the game.

3. Play With 4G Data Turned Off

Playing Pokémon Go requires a lot of data usage, as the game constantly requires an internet connection. Playing with 4G data turned off, however, can save you a lot of battery life. You can turn off mobile data by going to your phone's settings menu and clicking on "Data usage." Under this option, you can then turn off mobile data.

4. Close All Background Apps

One of the most significant battery drainers is the number of background apps running on your Android device. When you are playing Pokémon Go, closing all the unnecessary background applications, leaving only those that you need, can save you significant battery life. You can close background applications by pressing the recent apps button and swiping away any background apps that you don't need.

5. Always Keep Your Phone Cool

Finally, overheating is a typical reason for a fast-draining phone battery. When using your phone, make sure that it is not exposed to sunlight or kept in your pocket for extended periods, as this can cause the device to overheat. You can also get a cooling pad or case to prevent your phone from excessive heating.

In conclusion, Pokémon Go is an exciting game that can drain your Android phone's battery in record time. However, you can keep your phone alive for longer hours with some simple tips and tricks mentioned above. By implementing these tips, you will not only save your battery life but also enjoy a more satisfying Pokémon Go experience.

In your quest to be the very best, like no one ever was, as you catch Pokémon as part of your test, and train them as per your cause you might reduce your battery life drastically. Here, we list down some options to reduce the strain your smartphone’s battery faces in Pokémon Go, so you have those extra bars to catch more Pokémon.

Pokémon GO has taken the world by a storm and flooded social media feeds with images, news and funny compilations. Unless you have been living under a rock, you would be well aware about this phenomena, and for those of you who are caught up in fulfilling a lifelong desire to be a Pokémon trainer, you would be cursing every time your phone needs a re-charge. Well, these are 5 ways you can reduce your battery consumption.

 
### 1. Enabling Battery Saver in Pokémon GO


In Pokémon GO itself, there is a battery saver option under the Settings menu. This option does not change the game’s physics or the UI, but it does help conserve battery. It is still unclear as to how it does this, since Niantic, the company behind Pokémon Go, has yet released an explanation to the same.
To enable battery saver, tap the Pokéball at the bottom of the screen and select Settings. Under settings tap the option to turn on power saver mode.


 
### 2. Reducing Screen Brightness


If you have not done so, then do it immediately. Reducing the screen brightness will automatically help you improve your device’s battery life since the game is heavily reliant on using your device screen.
To reduce brightness, go to your device’s Settings and select Display and then tap on a preferred low level of brightness. it is not advisable to reduce the bar all the way down, unless you have the auto brightness settings turned on as it might dim the screens for certain devices to the point of no visibility.


 
### 3. Turn off the AR settings when catching Pokémon


The AR or augmented reality option when catching Raichu might look cute, but when you keep using it, it consumes battery. So do actions such as constantly zooming in and out, tapping your Pokémon to make those kawaii sounds and generally trying to take pictures of Pidgy on your car seat does consume a considerable amount of battery.
To shut off the AR mode, when you are near a Pokémon, you can tap the AR button on the top right hand corner. This would disable the function, while it means one doesn’t get to see cute Pokémon all around themselves, they can still catch Pokémon and play the game. Just saving battery along the way.

 
### 4. Turn off sounds and background apps


This is generally a no-brainer. Switching to silent mode and killing unused background apps (you might want to shut off those pesky WhatsApp and Slack notifications cause you’re training to be the best remember) would help reduce the battery consumption of the device. Though you may not see a tremendous boost in performance, you would be able to get a little more juice out of the device.

 
### Bonus Option


Buy a battery pack, or a case with a battery in it so as to boost the number of hours you can train. After all, you need to win all those gym badges and defend your turf.
