# Revamp Your Summer Soundtrack! Learn How to Install Outdoor Speakers Under Eaves and Overhangs Like a Pro!

Summer is here and everyone is ready to soak up the sun, catch some waves or just relax in the backyard. What better way to enjoy the season than listening to your favorite music on outdoor speakers? Installing outdoor speakers under eaves and overhangs can create the perfect backyard oasis and elevate your summer soundtrack.

Here's how to install outdoor speakers like a pro:

## Choose the Right Speakers

The first step is to choose the right outdoor speakers that can withstand the weather elements. Look for speakers that are labeled as outdoor or all-weather. These types of speakers are built to handle rain, snow, and extreme temperatures.

## Decide on Placement

The placement of your outdoor speakers is crucial for getting the best sound quality. Consider the size and layout of your outdoor space and how many speakers you'll need. Place the speakers in an area where they'll be protected from the elements and positioned for optimal sound quality.

## Mount the Speakers

Once you've chosen the right speakers and decided on the placement, it's time to mount them under eaves or overhangs. Here's how to get started:

### Step 1: Gather the Tools

You'll need a drill, screws, a mounting bracket, speaker wire, and wire connectors.

### Step 2: Set Up the Speakers

Attach the mounting bracket to the back of the speaker using the screws. Make sure the bracket is securely attached to the speaker.

### Step 3: Drill Holes

Drill pilot holes into the eave or overhang where you want to hang the speaker. Be sure to measure twice to ensure the holes are in the correct location.

### Step 4: Attach the Bracket to the Eave or Overhang

Using screws, attach the bracket to the eave or overhang. Make sure it's secure before attaching the speaker to the bracket.

### Step 5: Connect the Wires

Connect the speaker wire to the speaker and run it along the eave or overhang to the receiver or amplifier. Use wire connectors to secure the wire to the bracket and the speaker.

## Test the Sound Quality

Once you've installed and connected all of your outdoor speakers, it's time to test the sound quality. Play some of your favorite songs and adjust the volume as needed.

With these easy steps, you can create the perfect backyard oasis and enjoy your favorite music all summer long. So go ahead, revamp your summer soundtrack and install outdoor speakers under eaves and overhangs like a pro!

This article explains how to install outdoor speakers under eaves and overhangs. It covers the planning and the tools you need to have your favorite music tracks playing across your backyard.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- After reading the speaker manual, identify the eaves and overhangs for mounting positions.Test the speakers before mounting. Decide whether to add a volume control box. Buy plenty of the correct wire.Drill holes for mounting. Run wire from the speakers to the receiver/amplifier. Caulk the openings.

 
##   Read the Instructions  
 

If the idea of enjoying audio outside at home appeals to you, go for it; pick up a set of outdoor-rated (weatherproof) speakers. This type of speaker installation can seem daunting, but it's not as difficult as it sounds.

 

Before you start drilling holes or running wires, read the product's instructions. Manufacturers typically provide pertinent information along with a bracket mounting kit. After giving the manual a good scan, locate some positions for consideration.

 
##   Select the Mounting Locations  
 

Placing speakers under roof eaves or patio overhangs offers protection against the sun, wind, and rain. Another benefit is having less wire to run and disguise—important if you prefer a blended, seamless look to connected equipment.

 

Keep in mind a few things as you scout the available space:

 
- Confirm the speakers can be mounted securely to a solid material (such as wood, brick, stone, or concrete) and not to siding, gutters, or thin drywall. This reduces the chance of a speaker loosening or falling over time.Position the speakers up high (out of finger reach, 8 to 10 feet) and about 10 feet apart.Angle the speakers down slightly. This focuses the sound toward listeners and not neighbors. It also assists with water runoff to prevent pooling on the speaker surfaces.

 
##   Test the Speakers  
 

Test the outdoor speakers before mounting them, if possible. Location and positioning matter in terms of performance. All a test takes is temporarily setting up the speakers and running cables through an open door to your equipment inside. If the sound is perfect, mount away.

 
##   Add a Volume Control Box  
 

Unless you like going inside the house each time you want to turn the music volume outside up or down, consider a volume control box. Make this decision first because it can change where you drill holes to run the audio wires. It can also affect the overall amount of wire needed.

 

A volume control box is easy to connect between the speakers and receiver/amplifier. The same considerations exist if you plan to install a speaker B switch or a separate speaker selector switch.

 
##   Buy the Right Wire and Plenty of It  
 

Make sure you have enough wire of the proper gauge. If the estimated distance is 20 feet or less, 16 gauge should be fine. Otherwise, consider using thicker gauges, especially if the speakers are the low impedance kind.

 

It's the total distance traveled that counts and not a straight line from one component to another; all the little twists and corners count. Factor in some slack, too. When in doubt or if the numbers are too close to call, go for the thicker gauge wire.

 
##   Drill the Holes  
 

If you have conveniently located attic vents, push the wire through and toward the area closest to the receiver/amplifier. If not, or if going through the attic proves to be more trouble than it's worth, drill a small hole in the exterior wall. Don't run wire through windows or doors because that can lead to damage. Make things easier on yourself by choosing a drill spot that is easily accessible on both sides.

 
##   Run the Wires  
 

Run the wires from the speakers to the receiver/amplifier. Use banana plugs for the outdoor speakers if a compatible connection exists. Banana plugs limit the amount of exposed wire and are often more reliable and easier to manage than bare wires.

 

Once everything is connected, test the system and connections to make sure everything works properly, especially if you've opted for a volume control box, speaker B switch, or a separate speaker selector switch.

 

Leave some slack in the wire to guide water away from the points of contact. If the length leading to a speaker is taut, water can flow back into the speaker's terminals and cause potential damage; it's the same with holes drilled in walls. Adjust the wires so that they create a U-shaped dip. Water will follow down and safely drip off the bottom.

 
##   Caulk the Openings  
 

Finish up the installation project with some silicone-based caulk. You need to seal all the drill holes on both sides to maintain the house's insulation and keep unwanted bugs and pests outside.
