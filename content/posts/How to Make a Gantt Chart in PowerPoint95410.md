# Boost Your Project Management Skills Overnight: Learn How To Create Perfect Gantt Charts In PowerPoint

As a project manager, you know how important it is to have a clear and organized plan for your projects. One tool that has become essential in project management is the Gantt chart. Gantt charts provide a visual representation of the project schedule and help to track progress, identify potential delays, and manage resources effectively. With the increasing reliance on digital tools in the workplace, it is no surprise that Gantt charts are often created using PowerPoint. In this article, we will show you how to create perfect Gantt charts in PowerPoint that can help boost your project management skills overnight.

## Why Use PowerPoint for Gantt Charts?

As a project manager, you are likely using multiple tools to manage your projects. PowerPoint is an excellent tool to use for Gantt charts for a variety of reasons. First, you are likely already using PowerPoint for other purposes, so there’s no need to invest in a new tool. Second, PowerPoint is a robust and versatile tool that is easy to use, even for those with limited design experience. Finally, you can easily share your PowerPoint Gantt charts with stakeholders, making it a great tool for collaboration and communication.

## Steps to Create a Perfect Gantt Chart in PowerPoint

Creating a Gantt chart in PowerPoint is relatively simple, especially if you’re already familiar with the software. Here are the steps to follow:

### Step 1: Create a New PowerPoint Slideshow

Open PowerPoint and create a new blank slide show.

### Step 2: Add a Title

Add a title slide to your slideshow. This title slide will serve as the cover page for your Gantt chart.

### Step 3: Create a Table

Create a table in your PowerPoint slideshow that is large enough to cover the entire timeline of your project. The number of columns and rows will depend on how long your project is and how many tasks you have.

### Step 4: Customize the Table

Customize the table to your liking by changing the font size and colors. You can also change the background color of the table.

### Step 5: Enter the Tasks

Enter the tasks for your project into the table. Each row represents a task, and each column represents a time frame.

### Step 6: Add Bar Charts

Add bar charts for each task to the table. The length of the bar chart represents the duration of the task, and the position of the bar chart represents the start date.

### Step 7: Add Milestones

Add milestones to the chart to signify important project events, such as the completion of a task or meeting a critical deadline.

### Step 8: Customize the Gantt Chart

Customize the Gantt chart by adding logos, adjusting colors, fonts, and other design elements to make it visually appealing.

### Step 9: Share the Gantt Chart

Share the Gantt chart with stakeholders by saving it as a PDF or PowerPoint file. You can also insert it into other presentations or documents.

## Conclusion

Gantt charts are a vital tool in project management, and PowerPoint is an excellent tool to create them quickly and easily. By following these steps, you can create perfect Gantt charts in PowerPoint that can help boost your project management skills overnight. Remember to customize the chart to fit your project's specific needs and share it with stakeholders to keep everyone on track and informed.

In this article, we’ll lay out how to design one using the tools available in PowerPoint, and briefly discuss other options.

What to Know
 
- Creating a Gantt chart in PowerPoint is done by editing a stacked bar chart in the slide and making one set of bars invisible.You can save the slide as a template and reuse it, by editing the data under Insert > Chart > Edit Data.

 
##   How to Make a Gantt Chart in PowerPoint  
 

A Gantt chart is named after Henry Gantt and lays out visually the time it'll take to complete the sections of a task. Here's how to build one in PowerPoint.

 
- Open a blank slide in PowerPoint, then choose Insert > Chart.
 - In the open menu, choose Bar > Stacked Chart. A sample chart with a table to add data will automatically be generated in the slide.
 - Give each phase of your project a row, and name the columns Starting Date, End Date, and Duration. Leave Duration blank for now.
 - The chart will load with the data for the top bar at the bottom, which can be confusing. It will automatically update when you change a row, so you can check your work and make sure your rows are in the correct order.
 - Highlight the Start Date and End Date columns, then right-click and select Format Cells. Select Date from the category and the format you prefer in the window that opens.
 - Notice you can also set the format to “time.” Use this instead if you need a Gantt chart for a single day.
 - Add the starting and ending date for each task. The chart won’t reflect the change in your data yet, so don’t worry that all the bars seem to be the same.
 - Type the formula =$C2-$B2 into the first cell under “Duration” and press Tab. Then use the small square in the bottom right corner (the “fill handle”) and drag that down until you’ve reached the last phase in your chart. The duration will automatically fill in.
 - Click on your chart in the slide, choose the Filter icon, uncheck “End Date,” and click Apply. This option staggers the bars instead of keeping them even.
 - Choose the “start date” bars. If you select one, it will highlight all. Right-click, choose Fill and select No Fill.
 - If you’d like to color-code each task, double-click on the bar, and you’ll open the formatting menu for that individual piece.
 - This option renders those bars invisible.
 - The finished Gantt chart.

 
##   Should I Build Gantt Charts Manually or Use an Add-In?  
 

Keep in mind while this process can be somewhat time-consuming, there are several add-ins for Microsoft Office that will automate constructing these; you fill in the needed data, and they do the rest. 

 

Open a blank slide in PowerPoint, then choose Insert > Chart.

 

In the open menu, choose Bar > Stacked Chart. A sample chart with a table to add data will automatically be generated in the slide.

 

Give each phase of your project a row, and name the columns Starting Date, End Date, and Duration. Leave Duration blank for now.

 
The chart will load with the data for the top bar at the bottom, which can be confusing. It will automatically update when you change a row, so you can check your work and make sure your rows are in the correct order.
 

Highlight the Start Date and End Date columns, then right-click and select Format Cells. Select Date from the category and the format you prefer in the window that opens.

 
Notice you can also set the format to “time.” Use this instead if you need a Gantt chart for a single day.
 

Add the starting and ending date for each task. The chart won’t reflect the change in your data yet, so don’t worry that all the bars seem to be the same.

 

Type the formula =$C2-$B2 into the first cell under “Duration” and press Tab. Then use the small square in the bottom right corner (the “fill handle”) and drag that down until you’ve reached the last phase in your chart. The duration will automatically fill in.

 

Click on your chart in the slide, choose the Filter icon, uncheck “End Date,” and click Apply. This option staggers the bars instead of keeping them even.

 

Choose the “start date” bars. If you select one, it will highlight all. Right-click, choose Fill and select No Fill.

 
If you’d like to color-code each task, double-click on the bar, and you’ll open the formatting menu for that individual piece.
 

This option renders those bars invisible.

 

That said, most add-ins we found were subscriptions, instead of software, with some running as high as $149 a year. Unless you’re making these charts regularly or are designing more complex ones, you’re probably better off formatting them.

 

A more viable option is to go through this process once, save the results, and then copy the slide and edit the data whenever you need a new chart. To do this, go to File > Save A Copy and give it a different name. Then go to Chart > Edit Data and revise your information as needed.
