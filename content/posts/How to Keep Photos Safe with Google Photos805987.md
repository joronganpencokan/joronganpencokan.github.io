## 4. Search for specific photos 

Google Photos uses powerful search algorithms to help you find specific photos quickly. You can search for photos using keywords, people, places, and even objects. For example, if you're looking for a specific photo of your dog, you can simply search for "dog," and Google Photos will display all the photos with dogs in them. 

## 5. Share your photos with others 

Google Photos allows you to share your photos with others quickly and easily. You can share individual photos or entire albums with specific people. You can also create a link to share your photos with anyone, even if they don't have a Google account.
