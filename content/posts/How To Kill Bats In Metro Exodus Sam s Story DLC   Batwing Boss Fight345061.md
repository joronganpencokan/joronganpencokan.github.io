The Batwing boss battle is the highlight of the Sam's Story DLC for Metro Exodus. It's a challenging fight that requires tactics and skill. Here are some tips that will help you crush the Batwing boss.

## Tip #1: Use the Environment to Your Advantage

The Batwing boss fight takes place in a large open area. This area has plenty of cover that you can use to your advantage. Make use of the containers, walls, and other objects in the area to avoid the Batwing's attacks.

## Tip #2: Aim for the Weak Spots

The Batwing boss has two weak spots - its eyes and its underbelly. You can deal serious damage to the Batwing by shooting these weak spots. The eyes are harder to hit, but shooting them will stun the Batwing and give you a chance to deal more damage.

## Tip #3: Use Explosives

Explosives are effective against the Batwing boss. You can use grenades, mines, and other explosives to deal a lot of damage to the Batwing. However, be careful not to blow yourself up in the process.

## Tip #4: Keep Moving

The Batwing boss has a variety of attacks, including a sweeping attack that can knock you off your feet. Keep moving to avoid these attacks and to keep the Batwing from pinning you down.

## Tip #5: Don't Forget Your Companion

Your companion will help you during the Batwing boss fight. They can distract the Batwing and deal some damage of their own. Keep an eye on your companion and make sure they're safe.

With these tips in mind, you should be able to crush the Batwing boss and dominate the Sam's Story DLC for Metro Exodus. Remember to use the environment to your advantage, aim for the weak spots, use explosives, keep moving, and don't forget your companion. Good luck and happy gaming!


During the start of Metro Exodus Sam’s Story DLC, you will be on your way towards finding a ship. After dealing with a few local goons a Captain will guide you towards a submarine. Do not waste your bullet here, you can take down the goons from behind in stealth. After reaching the roof the Captain will ask you to follow using a zip line, but the journey will be interrupted with some oversized bat. This triggers a battle with bats in Metro Exodus Sam’s Story DLC and here are tips on how to survive Batwing.
 
## How to beat Batwing in Metro Exodus Sam’s Story DLC
 
You will fall on a track with a compartment. The bats will not attack in a group, use the compartment to shield yourself when you are not shooting. After getting the control back use your gun to shoot down one single huge bat which will be right in front of you. Others will fly behind it. After a few shots the entire group of bats will charge in, so dodge away and shield yourself behind the compartment.
 
Inside there are two boxes with supplies, you can grab some health packs and ammo. There will be only one single huge size bat that will stand right in front of you. Keep shooting it until it falls down. And also shield yourself from the group of bats flying right into your face.
 
After two or three attacks the oversized bat will expose itself on a roof. Continue shooting and it will attack you which will trigger a cutscene. The bat does not die, you will fall down and continue your journey towards the submarine.
 
### The Nuclear Fuel –
 
During this objective, after meeting the captain you will face the Batwing once again near the broken bridge. Last time during the first encounter the Batwing ran away, but this time he will be tougher to beat. So you need a strong weapon, good upgrades to deal with it. The Batwing will attack you near the bridge, an area with lots of scrap cars. It is the best spot to hide to avoid attacks from the batts. Once you see Batwing pull out Valve gun and try to get an accurate shot. Three to four hits and he will fall down, running away one more time. If you had not yet unlocked Valve gun then read our guide – Valve Sniper rifle location to know more.
