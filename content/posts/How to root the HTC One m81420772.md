## What is rooting?

Rooting is the process that allows users to gain access to the root of their phone's operating system. By doing so, you have the administrative privileges to customize and modify your phone's software and hardware features. Rooting is an essential step for those who love to tweak their devices, install custom ROMs, and experiment with different apps.

## Why should I root my HTC One M8?

There are several benefits to rooting your HTC One M8. Firstly, it allows you to delete or uninstall pre-installed apps that may be taking up valuable space and eating up your phone's performance. Secondly, you can install custom ROMs, which are alternative versions of Android that offer additional functionalities and customizations. Finally, rooting gives you access to apps that require superuser access to run, opening up a world of possibilities.

## How to root your HTC One M8

Before we proceed, it's essential to note that rooting can be a risky process that can potentially brick your phone. So, proceed at your own risk and make sure to backup your data before proceeding. Here's a step-by-step guide to rooting your HTC One M8.

### Step 1: Unlock your bootloader

Unlocking your bootloader is the first step to rooting your phone. This process is different for every phone, so make sure to follow the instructions specific to your device. For the HTC One M8, you need to visit the HTC Dev website and follow their instructions to unlock your bootloader.

### Step 2: Install a custom recovery

A custom recovery is essential for rooting your phone. It allows you to create backups, install custom ROMs, and other modifications. The most popular custom recovery for Android devices is TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project). Follow the instructions on the TWRP website to install it on your HTC One M8.

### Step 3: Download the rooting zip file

Now that you have unlocked your bootloader and installed a custom recovery, download the rooting zip file for your HTC One M8. You can find it on several websites, including XDA Developers. Save the zip file to your phone's internal storage.

### Step 4: Flash the rooting zip file

Using TWRP, flash the rooting zip file that you downloaded. To do so, boot your phone into recovery mode, select "Install," navigate to the zip file, and swipe to flash it. Wait for the process to complete, then reboot your phone.

### Step 5: Verify that your phone is rooted

To verify that your HTC One M8 is rooted, download Root Checker from the Google Play Store. Open the app and click on "Verify Root." If it shows a message saying "Congratulations! This device has root access," then your phone is successfully rooted.

## Conclusion

Rooting your HTC One M8 can give you access to its full potential and customize it to your heart's content. However, it is essential to follow the instructions carefully and backup your data before proceeding. By following this step-by-step guide, you can root your phone like a pro without any hassle.

Like any other recent HTC device, the One M8 also comes with an unlockable bootloader that makes gaining root access on it a pretty straightforward affair. If you have been looking for a guide to help you root your One M8, worry not as we have got you covered. 
Before you proceed with the steps below, make a backup of all the data stored on the phone including everything on the internal storage. This is because unlocking the bootloader will wipe clean the handset’s internal memory as well.
Step 1: To unlock the bootloader of the One M8 head over to the HTC Dev website, which has a detailed step-by-step guide with all the required download links. The steps require you to use adb/fastboot and while they may seem complicated they are actually pretty simple.
Once the bootloader is unlocked, your device will reboot into Android OS. Setup everything again, and transfer this SuperUser zip file to the internal storage of your HTC One.

Step 2: With the bootloader unlocked, half the job of rooting your One is already done. Now, you will have to proceed to flash a custom recovery on the handset using fastboot. You can download the latest version of TWRP for the international variant M8 from here.
If you are using any other variant, make sure to use the search bar to find the appropriate recovery for your device.
Step 3: Now, in the 1st step, you must have downloaded and extracted a zip file containing some adb/fastboot files. Copy the TWRP image file to the same folder.
Step 4: In the command prompt window that you used in Step 1 to unlock the bootloader, enter the following command:
adb devices

This command should confirm that your One is being detected by your PC. Now, reboot your One into bootloader/fastboot mode by entering the command
adb reboot bootloader
Once the device boots into the bootloader mode, use the Volume keys to navigate to the fastboot option and select it using the Power key.
Step 5: Now, enter the following commands:
fastboot flash recovery twrp.img
fastboot reboot 
At this point, you have successfully managed to install a custom recovery on your One.
Step 6: Switch off your One, and then reboot it into bootloader mode by pressing the Volume Down + Power button simultaneously. Navigate to the Recovery option using the volume keys, and select it using the Power button. Your One should now boot into TWRP recovery.

From there, tap on the Install button and then select the SuperUser zip file that you transferred to your One in Step 1. Reboot your device after this to enjoy root access on your One.
