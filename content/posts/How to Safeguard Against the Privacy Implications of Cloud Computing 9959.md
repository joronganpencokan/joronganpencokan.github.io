If you use cloud computing services, your personal data is at risk of being compromised. Cloud computing can provide a lot of benefits, such as accessibility and scalability, but these benefits are accompanied by risks. The security breaches in the recent years have proven that without proper safeguards, your personal data can be easily accessed and misused. In this article, I will give you tips on how to safeguard against cloud computing privacy breaches so you can protect yourself and your sensitive information.

The first step is to carefully choose a cloud computing service that is trustworthy and credible. You should do your research and look for providers with a strong track record in security and data privacy. Before committing to a service, read the terms and conditions and the privacy policy carefully. Find out what type of data is collected, how it will be used and who will have access to it.

Once you have chosen a trustworthy service provider, the next step is to set up strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA). Your login credentials are the first line of defense against unauthorized access. Make sure to choose a strong password that is hard to guess, contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, enable MFA to add an extra layer of security.

Another important step is to regularly backup your data, either in the cloud or on local storage. This way, if your account is compromised, you can quickly recover your data without losing everything.

Encryption is another important safeguard against cloud privacy breaches. Encryption provides a secure way to protect your sensitive data from unauthorized access. Make sure your cloud service provider uses encryption to protect your data both in transit and at rest.

Lastly, you need to be vigilant and monitor your account for any suspicious activities or signs of unauthorized access. Watch out for any unusual login attempts, unknown devices or IP addresses, or any strange activities on your account. If you suspect that your account has been compromised, change your password immediately and report it to your cloud service provider.

In conclusion, cloud computing privacy breaches are a risk we can’t ignore. However, by following these tips, you can mitigate your risk of becoming a victim of data misuse or theft. Choose a trustworthy provider, set up strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, regularly backup your data, use encryption, and monitor your account for any suspicious activities. With these safeguards in place, you can enjoy the benefits of cloud computing while keeping your personal data safe and secure.

Whatever the definition, using cloud computing (remember: it is a model, not a technology), businesses are able to provide a variety of digital services to individuals and businesses. Some examples include social and business networks, job search boards, secure storage facilities, as-a-service models, test and development environments, online shopping, collaboration applications, online document management, news services, streaming music and video, etc.
The problem is that cloud services are prone to privacy vulnerabilities and while multiple new industry segments in cybersecurity have rapidly evolved to help secure the privacy of user data, the cybercriminal underground always seems to be keeping pace.
In this article, we will take a look at the privacy issues in cloud computing and how to safeguard against them.

## Top Security Threats Facing Cloud Computing


A report by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) warned that “Among the most significant security risks associated with cloud computing is the tendency to bypass information technology (IT) departments and information officers. Although shifting to cloud technologies exclusively may provide cost and efficiency gains, doing so requires that business-level security policies, processes, and best practices are taken into account. In the absence of these standards, businesses are vulnerable to security breaches that can erase any gains made by the switch to cloud technology.” It identified the top 12 threats as:

 

Data breaches
Insufficient identity, credential and access management
Insecure interfaces and APIs
System vulnerabilities
Account hijacking
Malicious insiders
Advanced persistent threats
Data loss
Insufficient due diligence
Abuse and nefarious use of cloud services
Denial of service
Shared technology vulnerabilities



Each one of these risks has implications for an individual’s privacy. What these threats have in common is unauthorized access to data. A few examples of vulnerable access areas that threaten users’ privacy and provide opportunities for the theft of personal data include:

 

Malicious insiders. Employees working at a cloud service provider could have unrestricted access to sensitive company resources
Insecure APIs. An attacker stealing a token used by a customer to access the service through a service API can use the same token to manipulate their data
Shared technology issues. An attacker can hack into a virtual machine (VM) and then piggyback into other VMs on the server
Account hijacking. Watering-hole attacks and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are just two ways criminals can illegally gain unauthorized access to a system and steal personal data

 
## When Clouds Turn Dark


Cloud computing is based on access rather than ownership. But the same features that make it so accessible and usable – including elasticity, multi-tenancy and powerful resource utilization – also create security issues.
Three of the main challenges are geography, configuration management and auditing.

 
## Elasticity


In a Tech Target article, Matthew Pascucci identifies four potential problem areas for Platform as a Service (PaaS):

 

Some PaaS systems may be up and running only for short periods of time, so auditing them is a unique challenge
Considering incident response and forensics, the challenge of preserving, collecting and analyzing data on moving systems may be something the organization isn’t prepared for
Sensitive data could be stored in different geographical locations and moving data between applications can have privacy implications
With regard to configuration management, the last thing you want is to have multiple systems throughout your infrastructure that could increase your risk footprint

 
## Multi-Tenancy


An article by Wired magazine (see Sources) reviews the disadvantages of the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) space. On privacy, it notes:

 

Strict national data privacy laws mean that data about many European customers must by law be stored in servers located within the countries’ borders. “As a result, cloud or hosted applications must be run from data centers in multiple countries. Most multitenant PaaS providers will find it difficult to make that happen.”
If a cloud database is breached, chances are a hacker will be able to steal the data of “dozens or hundreds of different business customers.”



Writing on LinkedIn, Alan Dennis explores multi-tenancy and privacy issues: the primary issue, he says, is that because resources share hardware, there is an inherent security risk — for instance, proximity-based attacks.
“Because cloud computing platforms are open, they are subject to attacks from within and from the outside. While most cloud service providers offer security mechanisms such as firewalls and virtual networks, the underlying data storages servers may be a vulnerability.”
In addition, “Many issues with cloud security are a product of improper configuration of environments.” And while Dennis does not mention this explicitly, it is sometimes the customer who does not have the knowledge to configure their system for maximum security.

 
## Resource Utilization


Sharing cloud resources means that users must share a network infrastructure. As discussed in the Chicago Policy Review, there are multiple dangers associated with virtual networks:

 

As networks can’t be monitored by protection mechanisms in the underlying physical network, virtual networks are actually an obstacle to standard detection and prevention mechanisms
In addition, users do not have as much control over their data as they would if it was stored using traditional methods, which raises concerns about data integrity, privacy, recovery vulnerability, media sanitization and data backup

 
## Safeguarding Against Key Cloud Computing Privacy Issues


There are multiple tactics you can use to safeguard against identified cloud-computing privacy issues. Remember that these are not all of the potential issues with cloud computing; new ones are detected and resolved all the time. However, these are the factors to consider for immediate security.

 
## Data Breaches


Utilize multifactor authentication and encryption to ensure against information breaches and the theft of personal data.

 
## Network Leakage


Implement strong network traffic encryption and select an “intelligent solution.” Modern Host Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPSs) can monitor networks for suspicious behavior, unlike standard Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that provide notification only of attacks made with known intrusion signatures. An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) can identify known intrusion signatures and some unknown attacks because it keeps a database of generic attack behavior and can intelligently alert security employees about unusual activity.
State-of-the-art network security is ideally a mix of IDS, IPS, and an application layer firewall. Advanced analytics powers intelligence and can enable real-time visibility into a cloud’s infrastructure.

 
## Unauthorized Access


Strong identity, credentials and key management software can mitigate the risks of attacks and protect the APIs that customers use to manage and integrate with cloud services. In addition, ensure insiders are well-vetted, and destroy the credentials of employees who have left the company.
Anyone dealing with personal information should be trained on handling data securely. Limit data access to what a user needs. In some instances, you may want to limit what a user can access depending on the device they are using, e.g. not being able to log into the network from a cell phone.

 
## Compliance


Understand privacy compliance like the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act. What data stored abroad can be legally accessed by U.S. law enforcement has always been a contentious issue. The CLOUD Act, signed into law in March 2018, seeks to clarify who can access what, and where. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation, but it is extraterritorial and has implications for anyone that does business with Europe.

 
## Ethical Communication


Ensure individuals know what personal information is being held and how it is being held, and that there is a mechanism in place to remove them from the database if they opt out of a service or choose to be forgotten. This is mandatory in global compliance laws. Not communicating with your users about what, how and when you use their data could land you in hot water.

 
## Storage and Data Loss


Privacy laws in different countries may place limitations on the transfer of some personal data to other countries. Understand where data may be heading and the law in that location. Accidents happen, and so do physical so-called “Acts of God.” Have good backup, disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place. And remember, backups should be encrypted. Many organizations solve (some) privacy issues by retaining control of sensitive data on-site. See Geography below.

 
## Security Policies


A business that does not have written security and privacy policies – from data retention and destruction policies to BYOD guidelines and third party Service Level Agreements (SLAs) – is a breach of privacy data waiting to happen. Such an organization will not only be deemed untrustworthy and undependable by its customers, its employees will not understand their responsibilities in securing private data.

 
## Auditing and Monitoring
 
## Geography


The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) has published a list of the main regulations governing data flow globally. Some of the information showcases some potential problems for cloud computing. For instance, in 2012, Australia enacted the Personally Controlled Electronic Health Records Act, which requires that personal health records be stored only in Australia.

 
## Configuration Management


 

 
## A Final Word on Cloud Computing and Privacy Issues


Most important of all, organizations should understand their responsibilities for securing their customers’ data in the cloud. One small slip could mean disaster; when it comes to privacy, there’s no such thing as too much security.
For the final word, we’ll return again to journalist Kevin Fogarty. In an article appropriately titled “Why is IT so bad at cloud computing?”, he makes an amusingly snippy observation: “Cloud providers aren’t there to rent you slivers of utopia for which you can pay by the hour and only for as much heaven as you can use […] It might be the provider’s fault another customer’s hackers were able to approach your VMs; it’s your fault there was nothing to stop them once they got there.”
