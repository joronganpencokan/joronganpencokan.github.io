# Discover the Secret to Finding Out How Many Friends You REALLY Have on Snapchat - It's Shocking!

Social media platforms have become a significant part of our lives. Amongst the plethora of social media apps, Snapchat is one of the most commonly used social media platforms. It enables users to share snaps and stories with their friends, followers, and family members.

Snapchat is known for its user-friendly interface and unique features, making it popular amongst teens and young adults. However, do you know how many friends you genuinely have on Snapchat? The answer might surprise you.

The official Snapchat app only displays the number of friends you have on your profile. Still, there's a little-known trick that reveals your actual friends' count, including the ones who've deleted you, and it's quite a revelation, to say the least.

# Unveiling the Secret

To discover how many friends you genuinely have on Snapchat, you need to follow these simple steps:

1. Launch the Snapchat app on your device.
2. Swipe down from the top of the screen to access your profile.
3. Tap on the Settings icon located in the top right corner.
4. Scroll down and tap on the 'I Need Help' option.
5. Select 'My Account and Security' option.
6. Tap on the 'Account Information' category.
7. Click on 'My Data.'
8. Finally, click on 'Submit Request.'

After submitting the request, Snapchat will send you an email revealing the details of your account, including the actual number of friends you have, including your deleted friends.

# The Shocking Truth

If you've never deleted a friend or been deleted off someone's friend list, then the number of friends you find might not be shocking. However, if you've been actively using Snapchat for some time, you might be surprised to see who's still following your snaps and stories.

When you find out how many friends you genuinely have on Snapchat, you'll likely go through a range of emotions. Some people might feel ecstatic to see a high number of friends who keep in touch, while others might be surprised to realize how many friends they thought they still had on Snapchat have deleted them.

# Final Thoughts

Snapchat might not be as popular as it once was, but it still remains a significant part of our daily lives. There's no denying the excitement of finding out the number of genuine Snapchat friends you have. The process is straightforward, and with a few clicks and tapping, you can uncover the shocking truth about your Snapchat friend count.

However, it's essential to remember that the number of friends you genuinely have on Snapchat doesn't define your self-worth or your popularity. It's just one metric in a sea of information that makes up a small piece of your digital footprint. So, try to take your actual friend list count with a grain of salt, and focus on building meaningful relationships with the people who matter to you the most.
