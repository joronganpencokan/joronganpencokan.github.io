Microsoft Edge has a feature to move tabs to a different profile window, wichch will come in handy for people who use the browser with multiple profiles.
 
The Chromium version of Microsoft Edge comes with an option that allows you to set up multiple profiles to share the browser with other users or keep things separate, such as personal and work. The only caveat is that because profiles are completely isolated from each other, you can’t drag a tab to another profile window if you are using this setup.
 
However, starting with version 89 and higher (currently in the Canary channel), the browser introduces an option that makes it easier to move tabs between profiles on Windows 10. 
 
In this guide, you’ll learn the steps to move a tab to a different profile window with the Chromium version of Microsoft Edge.
