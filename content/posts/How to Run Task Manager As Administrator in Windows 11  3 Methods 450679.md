The new Task Manager of Windows 11 even allows users to check the RAM, GPU, HDD/SSD, and CPU activity in real-time. Out of all features that it provides, it was the ability to find and terminate processes that make the utility most valuable.
If you rely on Task Manager on Windows 11 to kill running processes & apps, you might have encountered an error prompt ‘Access is denied’. The error message usually appears when you try to kill apps & processes that require elevated privileges to be terminated.
