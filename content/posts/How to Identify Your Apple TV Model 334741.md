Unlock the Secret to Your Apple TV: Discover How to Identify Your Model Like a Pro!

Apple TV is a modern streaming device that allows people to watch their favourite shows and movies on their television set. Over the years, Apple has released several versions of Apple TV, each with its own set of features and capabilities. But before you go delving into the many features of your Apple TV, it is important to know what model you own. Identifying the model you own will help you to understand which features are available on your device, as well as which apps and games are compatible with it. 

Here are a few ways to identify your Apple TV model like a pro:

1. Check the model number in the settings 

The easiest and most accurate way to identify your Apple TV model is to check the model number in the settings. On your Apple TV, navigate to the settings app, and then to the General section. From here, select the About option. In the About section, you will find the model number for your Apple TV. 

2. Look at the ports on the back 

Another way to identify your Apple TV model is to look at the ports on the back. Each Apple TV model has a specific set of ports that can help you identify which model you own. For example, the Apple TV 4K comes with an HDMI 2.0a port, while the earlier models only have HDMI 1.4 ports.

3. Examine the remote 

The remote that comes with your Apple TV can also help you identify the model you own. The Siri Remote, which comes with the Apple TV 4K, is noticeably different from the earlier Remote. The Siri Remote has a touchpad and a microphone, which the earlier models do not have.

4. Analyze the physical appearance 

The physical appearance of your Apple TV can also help you identify the model you own. Each model has a distinct shape and size, which can help you narrow down which model you have. For example, the Apple TV 4 and 4K are taller and wider than the earlier models, which were more compact.

In conclusion, identifying your Apple TV model is crucial if you want to fully immerse yourself in streaming content on your device. Knowing which model you own can help you understand which features are available to you, as well as which apps and games are compatible with your device. By following the above steps, you can quickly and accurately identify your Apple TV model like a pro!

Apple, sadly, did not do a great job of making the various Apple TVs visually distinct from one another – at least, not in an immediately obvious way. As a result, it can be hard to tell the difference between all of Apple’s similar-looking Apple TV offerings, especially in secondhand marketplaces like eBay. Use this guide to identify your Apple TV model and learn the key differences between different models of Apple TV, both in hardware and software.
 
## Rapid Identification
 
Look for these ports when scanning the back of the device for rapid identification and answer the following questions:
 
- Is it silvery-white with component video inputs? If so, it’s an Apple TV 1st Generation.
 - Does it have Micro-USB and optical audio? If so, it’s an Apple TV 2nd or 3rd Generation. For further differentiation, check the model number on the bottom of the device or in “Settings -> General -> About -> Model” on the Apple TV.
 - Does it have a USB-C port? If so, it’s an Apple TV HD (previously Apple TV 4th generation).
 - Does it not have a USB port of any kind? If so, it’s an Apple TV 4K.

 
## Checking the Model Number
 

 
If you have an Apple TV 2nd or 3rd generation, they’re visually indistinguishable. But they do have different model numbers.
 
To check your model number, look at the bottom of the device. At the bottom of the label you’ll see regulatory text and logos. In the first line scan for the “Made in China” text. Immediately after that line you’ll see the model number prefixed with an A.
 
You can also find the model number within tvOS. Navigate to “Settings -> General -> About -> Model” to see the model number, prefixed with an A.
 
- A1218 is 1st generation.
 - A1378 is 2nd generation.
 - A1427 is 3rd generation.
 - A1469 is 3rd generation.
 - A1625 is 4th generation HD.
 - A1842 is 4K

 
### Two 3rd Generation Model Numbers?
 
The two 3rd-generation models come from the early 2012 and early 2013 models. The newer early 2013 model of the Apple TV 3rd generation has an A5 processor build on a smaller 28nm process size compared to the early 2012’s original 32nm process size. The early 2013 Apple TV 3rd generation also adds support for peer-to-peer AirPlay.
 
## Feature Differences
 
Ports that are familiar to most users or visually notable are in bold. These ports can be used to identify the Apple TVs quickly. All take the same power supply and use visually-indistinguishable Ethernet connectors.
 
### Apple TV 4K
 
- HDMI 2.0a (2160p, Dolby Vision, and HDR10)
 - Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n/ac)
 - Bluetooth 5.0
 - No USB Port

 
### Apple TV HD (Previously, Apple TV Fourth-Generation)
 
- HDMI 1.4 (720p or 1080p)
 - Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n/ac)
 - Bluetooth 4.0
 - USB‑C above HDMI port

 
### Apple TV (3rd generation)
 
- HDMI (720p or 1080p)
 - Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n)
 - Optical audio
 - Micro-USB below HDMI port

 
### Apple TV (2nd generation)
 
- HDMI (720p)
 - Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n)
 - Optical audio
 - Micro-USB below HDMI port

 
### Apple TV (1st generation)
 
- HDMI and component video (480p or 720p)
 - Wi-Fi (802.11b/g/n)
 - Optical and RCA stereo audio
 - USB 2.0 (for service and support)
 - Rectangular shape
 - Silver and clear plastic chassis

 
## Conclusion
 
If you have access to the Apple TV or can see pictures of the Apple TV’s ports, you’ll be able to reliably distinguish its feature set. But the most informative side is actually the bottom of the device where the model number is printed. That can be directly translated into the exact model, with no need to try and visually separate ports. To see a complete accounting of all the differences between each Apple TV generation, check out EveryMac’s database of Apple hardware.
