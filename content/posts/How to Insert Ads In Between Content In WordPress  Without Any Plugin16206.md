# Revolutionize Your Ad Strategy! Learn How to Place Ads Between Content in WordPress Without Any Plugin!

Are you looking for ways to boost your online revenue and capture more audience through advertising without using any plugin? You can achieve this easily by learning how to place ads between contents on WordPress. Advertisements are one of the primary means of generating revenue for most websites. It can be challenging to find the right balance of ads placements without overly disturbing your website visitors.

For website owners, choosing the optimal ad placement is crucial for generating maximum revenue from your website traffic. If you're employing Google AdSense or other ad networks, it's essential to understand the effect of ad positioning on ad revenue. Ads placement in the wrong locations can frequently result in poor ad revenue and user experience.

In this article, we're going to cover how to place ads between content in WordPress without using any plugin.

## Why It's Essential to Place Ads Between Content

A good ad strategy should consider both user experience and revenue generation. Ads placement between content is one of the best strategies that help achieve both goals. Here are some of its benefits:

1. Increases impressions - Ads placement between content gets seen and clicked more often than ads positioned elsewhere.

2. Provides higher CTR - An ad positioned between content typically receives a higher CTR than other ad placements.

3. Better User Experience - By putting ads between content, you can reduce the number of ads on a given page, which enhances the user experience.

## How to Place Ads between Contents in WordPress

Let's now look at the steps you need to follow to place your ads between contents in WordPress without using any plugin:

### 1. Copy the Ad Code 

First, you must obtain the code from the ad network or Google AdSense. Copy the ad code, which you want to place between different contents on your website.

### 2. Open The Theme Editor

On your WordPress dashboard, click on Appearance > Theme Editor. When you open the editor, you'll see a complete list of your website's CSS, header, and other files.

### 3. Place Ad Code Between Contents in WordPress

The next stage is to determine the pages or posts where you want to place the ads. You can choose to put the ad between every two articles or articles of a particular category.

Insert the ad code just before the second post on the page. Here is an example of how to do it.

```
<?php if (have_posts()) : ?>

        <?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>

        <?php the_content('<p class="serif">Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</p>'); ?>

        /*Insert your Ad code Here*/

        <?php endwhile; ?>

<?php else : ?>

<?php endif; ?>
```

### Conclusion

Placing ads between content is a highly effective advertising strategy. By following the above steps, you can increase the number of clicks, impressions, and revenue from your ads. Understanding the optimal ad placement is essential to maximize your earnings from your site. With these steps, you can revolutionize your ad placement strategies and take your ad revenue to the next level.

If you run a blog website, most probably you will be inserting ads in your blog to generate some income. In WordPress (self-hosted), you can easily add ads to the sidebar by inserting the ad code to a text widget in the Widget section. The difficult part is to add ads to the content, particularly in-between the content. While there are some plugins that allow you to add shortcode to the content, they are not feasible if your blog already have thousands of article, unless you are willing to go back to insert the shortcode in every single article. In this article, we will show you a simple way where you can easily insert ad (or any other stuff) in-between your content without using any plugin.

Note: This method requires some meddling with the code. If you are not comfortable dealing with the code, don’t attempt it. You might also want to create a staging site of your blog and test this method on the staging site first before making it live.
 
Here is the method:
 
1. In your theme folder, open the functions.php file with a text editor.
 
2. Insert the following lines to the end of the file, before the “?>” tag
 
Remember to change the “insert_ad_code_here” string to the actual ad code. Also, if there is any instance of single quote (‘) in your ad code, you have to add a \ before it. For example, if your ad code is something like:
 
You have to make them all into one line and insert a \ before the single quote:
 
## Explanation of the function
 
What we are doing with this function is to take the content for each post and break it up into each paragraph. We then detect whether the third paragraph exists. If yes, we insert the ad code to the end of the paragraph. Lastly, we insert back the starting paragraph tag to each section and glue them back into a complete article. 
 
Things you can change here include:
 
1. The paragraph to insert the ad tag. The default in the above code is the third paragraph. You can change to the second paragraph by changing all instances of $content_block[2] to $content_block[1]. 
 
Note: The count of the array starts from 0, so $content_block[2] means the third paragraph instead of the second.
 
2. The tag to break the article. I used the paragraph tag <p> to break the article. You can use <h2> or  <h3> tag instead as the marker.
 
3. The ad code. You don’t necessarily have to insert ad in-between the content. You can insert newsletter subscription form or any other stuff that you deem appropriate for your site. 
 
Lastly, don’t forget to save the file and upload it to the server. As I mentioned earlier, it is best to test this on a staging site first before making it live.
