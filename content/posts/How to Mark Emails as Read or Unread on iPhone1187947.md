Title: Unlock the Secret to Mastering Email on Your iPhone - Learn How to Easily Mark Emails as Read or Unread!

Introduction

Email has revolutionized the way we communicate in our daily lives. However, with the influx of emails pouring in every day, keeping up with your inbox can be challenging. One of the best ways to manage your emails on your iPhone is to learn how to mark them as read or unread quickly, making it easier to prioritize your messages. In this article, we will unlock the secret to mastering email on your iPhone and show you how to easily mark emails as read or unread.

Step 1: Open Your Emails

The first step is to open your Mail app on your iPhone. Then, tap on the inbox where you have received new emails. Your inbox will show you all the new emails received, which are marked as unread.

Step 2: Marking Emails as Read or Unread

To mark an email as read or unread, you simply need to swipe your finger from left to right over the email you want to mark. Doing this will reveal multiple options, including "Mark as Read" or "Mark as Unread." Depending on what option you choose, you can change the status of the email from unread to read or vice versa.

Step 3: Marking Multiple Emails as Read or Unread

If you have a pile of unread emails in your inbox, it can be time-consuming to mark each email individually. Fortunately, the Mail app on your iPhone offers you the option to mark multiple emails as unread or read.

To do this, go to your inbox and then tap the "Edit" option located at the top right corner of the screen. Then, tap the empty circle located to the left of each email you want to mark. You can select as many emails as you want. Once you have selected the emails, tap the "Mark" option located at the bottom of the screen. Here, you can choose either "Mark as Read" or "Mark as Unread" as per your preference.

Conclusion

Now that you know how to mark emails as read or unread on your iPhone, managing your emails will be a breeze. This simple yet useful trick will help you prioritize emails, making it easier to keep up with your busy schedule. So, start using this trick and manage your emails efficiently.

With all the emails received every day, keeping an iPhone inbox organized requires a quick way to handle mail. To manage your email inbox, use features in the Mail app that comes with the iPhone (and iPod Touch and iPad) to mark emails as read, unread, or flag messages for later attention.

 
##   How to Mark iPhone Emails as Read  
 

New emails that haven't been read have blue dots next to them in the Mail Inbox. The number of these unread messages displays on the Mail app icon. Whenever an email is opened in the Mail app, iOS marks it as read. The blue dot disappears, and the number on the Mail app icon declines.

 
Instructions in this article apply to devices running iOS 5 and later.
 

To remove the blue dot without opening the email:

 
- In the Inbox, swipe from left to right across the email to reveal the blue Read button.
 - Tap Mark as Read. Or, swipe the message until the icon snaps to the middle of the screen.
 - When you tap the button or let go of the line, the blue dot disappears, and the message appears as read.

To mark multiple messages as read:

 

In the Inbox, swipe from left to right across the email to reveal the blue Read button.

 

Tap Mark as Read. Or, swipe the message until the icon snaps to the middle of the screen.

 

When you tap the button or let go of the line, the blue dot disappears, and the message appears as read.

 
- In the Mail app, go to the Inbox.
 - Tap Edit, then tap each email you want to mark as read. A checkmark appears to show that the message is selected.
 - Select Mark.
 - Tap Mark as Read.
 - The blue circles disappear from the selected emails.

 
##   Mark Emails as Read With IMAP  
 

Sometimes an email system marks messages as read without you doing anything on your iPhone. If any of your email accounts use the IMAP protocolÂ (Gmail uses IMAP), any message you read or mark as read in a desktop or web-based email program also appears as read on the iPhone. IMAP syncs messages and message status across all devices that use those accounts.

 

In the Mail app, go to the Inbox.

 

Tap Edit, then tap each email you want to mark as read. A checkmark appears to show that the message is selected.

 

Select Mark.

 

Tap Mark as Read.

 

The blue circles disappear from the selected emails.

 
##   How to Mark iPhone Emails as Unread  
 

You may read an email and then decide you want to mark it as unread to remind yourself that you need to come back to it later.

 
- Go to the Inbox.
 - Tap Edit, then tap each email you want to mark as unread.
 - Tap Mark, then tap Mark as Unread.
 - The blue dots marking these messages as unread reappear.

 
##   How to Flag Emails on iPhone  
 

The Mail app also flags messages by adding an orange dot next to the email. Flag emails to remind yourself that a message is important or that you need to take action on it. Flagging (or unflagging) messages is very similar to marking messages.

 

Go to the Inbox.

 

Tap Edit, then tap each email you want to mark as unread.

 

Tap Mark, then tap Mark as Unread.

 

The blue dots marking these messages as unread reappear.

 
Just like with marking messages as read, swipe across emails and either tap the Unread button or swipe all the way across.
 
- Go to the Mail app and open the folder that contains the message you want to flag.
 - Tap Edit, then tap each email you want to flag.
 - Tap Mark, then select Flag.
 - The messages you selected appear with orange dots next to them.

 

You can flag multiple messages at once using the same steps as described in the last few sections. You can also flag an email by swiping right to left and tapping the Flag button.

 

Go to the Mail app and open the folder that contains the message you want to flag.

 

Tap Edit, then tap each email you want to flag.

 

Tap Mark, then select Flag.

 

The messages you selected appear with orange dots next to them.

 
If you flag an unread message, the blue unread dot displays inside an orange flagged ring.
 

To see a list of flagged emails, tap the Mailboxes button in the upper-left corner to move back to your list of email inboxes. Then tap Flagged.
