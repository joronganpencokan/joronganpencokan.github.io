Unlock the Hidden Hack: Install Command Line Tools on Mac without Xcode TODAY!

If you're a Mac user, you might have heard about Xcode Command Line Tools. These tools help developers to write, test, and deploy their code on Apple platforms. However, what if you want to use Command Line Tools for other purposes, without installing the huge Xcode package? Here's how to do it!

1. Check if you have Command Line Tools installed

First, let's see if you already have Command Line Tools installed. Open your Terminal and type the following command:

```sh
xcode-select -p
```

If you get a path to Xcode, such as "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer", it means that you have Xcode and its tools installed. If you get an error message, it means that you don't have Command Line Tools installed.

2. Install Command Line Tools

To install Command Line Tools directly, you can use this command:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

This will prompt a window to install the necessary software. Follow the instructions, and you're done.

3. Download Command Line Tools package without Xcode

If you don't want to install Xcode or use the prompt, you can also download the Command Line Tools package directly from Apple Developer website. Search for Command Line Tools for your version of macOS and download it.

Once you download it, open the .dmg file and run the .pkg file inside. Follow the instructions, and you're done.

4. Verify Command Line Tools installation

To verify that you have correctly installed Command Line Tools, open Terminal and type this command:

```sh
gcc --version
```

If you get a response similar to "Configured with: …", it means that you have correctly installed the tools.

Conclusion

In summary, installing Command Line Tools without Xcode is easy and straightforward. Whether you want to code or use certain command-line tools, you can do it without the huge Xcode package. By following these steps, you can install Command Line Tools on your Mac today and unleash new power for your daily work.

Since Apple’s OS X is based on UNIX, you can run many of the UNIX commands on your Mac right from the Terminal app. These commands help you accomplish a lot of tasks on your machine without having to work with the graphical user interface. In order for you to make use of these commands, you do not need to be a coder, as there are many simple commands that even a non-programmer can understand and execute on his or her machine.
 
In order to use these UNIX commands on your Mac, you need to have a utility called “Command Line Tools” installed on your machine. By default, OS X does not ship with this tool, and you need to manually install it. One way to install it is to install Xcode, and it will install these commands as well. But, Xcode is heavy (in filesize), and unless you are a developer, you won’t have any need for it.
 
In this tutorial we will show you how you can install the Command Line Tools without Xcode.
 
Note: this guide only applies to Macs that run OS X 10.9 and higher.
