# 10 Incredibly Easy Steps To Save Your Precious Data From A Crashed SD Card - You Won't Believe How Simple It Is!

Are you tired of losing your precious data due to a crashed SD card? Losing important files, documents, photos or videos can be quite frustrating, but don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. In this article, we’ll show you ten incredibly easy steps to save your data from a crashed SD card. And the best part? It is much simpler than you think! 

## Step 1 - Stop using the SD card.

If your SD card has crashed, the worst thing you can do is continue using it. A damaged SD card can corrupt your files permanently, and continuing to use it could make things worse. So, the first step is to stop using the card immediately, and avoid any further damage.

## Step 2 - Use a card reader.

It’s best to use a card reader to retrieve data from a crashed SD card, rather than trying to connect it directly to your computer. In some cases, your computer may not recognize your SD card, so it’s much better to use a card reader to ensure a better chance of data recovery.

## Step 3 - Check for physical damage.

Look for any physical damage to your SD card. Examine the card and check for any scratches, bends, or cracks. If you notice any damage, this could be the reason why your data has been lost. In such cases, you should consider using professional data recovery services.

## Step 4 - Use data recovery software.

Data recovery software is an excellent tool for retrieving lost data from a crashed SD card. There are a number of free and paid software options available online that can help you recover your files. Some of the most popular software options include EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard, Recuva, and Disk Drill.

## Step 5 - Scan your SD card.

Once you’ve downloaded and installed data recovery software, connect your SD card to the card reader and begin the scanning process. This process may take some time, depending on the size of your SD card and the amount of data stored on it. Ensure that your computer doesn’t go to sleep or switch off during the scanning process.

## Step 6 - Preview and select your files.

Once the scanning process is complete, the software will display a list of recoverable files. Preview and select the files you want to recover, and then click the “recover” button to start the recovery process.

## Step 7 - Save recovered files to a new location.

When you’ve recovered your files, save them to a new location on your computer, rather than to your SD card. This will help you avoid any further data loss and ensure that your files are safe and secure.

## Step 8 - Format your SD card.

If you have successfully recovered your data, it is advisable to format your SD card. Doing so will help you avoid any future crashes and keep your data safe. You can format your SD card using your camera or using your computer’s built-in formatting tool.

## Step 9 - Use a backup device.

Consider using a backup device to ensure that your data is always safe and secure. You can use cloud services, external hard drives or USB drives as backup devices. Regular backups can help you avoid data loss due to crashed SD cards.

## Step 10 - Contact a professional data recovery service.

If you’ve tried all the above steps and still can’t recover your data, then it’s time to consider professional data recovery services. Professionals can restore your lost data quickly and effectively, but their services come at a cost. However, it is worth investing in professional data recovery services if your files are incredibly valuable and critical.

Conclusion

Losing data due to a crashed SD card can seem like a nightmare. However, with these ten easy steps, you can recover your data quickly and easily. Remember to stop using your SD card immediately, use the right tools, and take necessary precautions to prevent any data loss in the future.
