Title: Unlock Secrets in Hitman 3 with this Pro Tip: Discover the Exclusive Greenhouse Key Location!

Introduction
Hitman 3 is a stealth video game that requires players to use their creativity and cunning to accomplish their objectives. One of the key elements of the game is finding the right tools and keys to unlock the different areas within the various levels. In this article, we will be sharing one of the most crucial tips in the game - the location of the exclusive greenhouse key.

Location
The exclusive greenhouse key can be found in the Dubai level on the top floor of the atrium area. The key is located within a locked security room near the helicopter landing pad. To get to the security room, you will need to first eliminate the guard who has access to the room.

Eliminating the Guard
To eliminate the guard, you need to dress up in a guard uniform, which can be found in the staff area. Once dressed as the guard, you will need to head towards the security room via the stairwell located near the staff area. As you approach the security room, you will encounter the guard blocking your path.

To eliminate the guard, wait for him to turn his back to you and then approach him from behind. Subdue him by pressing the button prompted on your screen. Once subdued, you can then take his keycard, which will allow you access to the security room.

Unlocking the Security Room
Head towards the locked security room and swipe the keycard to gain access. Once inside the room, you will find the exclusive greenhouse key on a table. Take the key and add it to your inventory.

Benefits of the Greenhouse Key
The exclusive greenhouse key grants you access to the greenhouse area within the Dubai level. The greenhouse area is significant as it contains two useful items, a silenced sniper rifle and a deadly poison.

The silenced sniper rifle is particularly useful as it allows you to take out your targets from a distance without alerting anyone. On the other hand, the deadly poison can be used to eliminate targets discreetly by poisoning their food or drinks.

Conclusion
In conclusion, one of the most crucial tips in Hitman 3 is discovering the exclusive greenhouse key location. With the help of this key, players can unlock the greenhouse area that houses a silenced sniper rifle and a deadly poison. As you play through the game, always be on the lookout for keys, tools, and other items that can help you accomplish your objectives.
