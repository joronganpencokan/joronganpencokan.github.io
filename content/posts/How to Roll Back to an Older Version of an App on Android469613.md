Download the APK file to your device.
Go to your device's "Downloads" folder and tap on the APK file.
Android might ask for permission to install apps from unknown sources. If so, you need to enable this setting before proceeding.
Follow the prompts to install the old version of the app.

Step 4: Disable Automatic Updates, Again!
