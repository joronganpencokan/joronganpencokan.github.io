Are you tired of juggling multiple phone calls when trying to arrange a meeting with multiple people? If so, you'll be happy to know that making a conference call has never been easier thanks to Skype. And in this article, we'll walk you through the process step-by-step.

Step 1: Setting up a Skype Account

First things first, you'll need to set up a Skype account if you don't already have one. The process is quick and easy, and you can do it on the Skype website. All you need is an email address, phone number, or Facebook account to sign up.

Step 2: Adding Contacts

Once you have your account set up, you'll need to add the contacts you want to include in your conference call. You can either search for them by their Skype name, email address or phone number, or you can import your contacts from your address book.

Step 3: Making the Call

To start the conference call, select the "Create a group" option on the Skype app, and then choose the contacts you want to include in your call. You can add up to 50 people in a single call, so there's plenty of room for everyone.

Step 4: Managing the Call

During the call, you have several options for managing the conversation. You can mute your microphone or turn off your video if you need to step away for a moment. You can also share your screen if you need to present a document or slideshow, and you can chat with individual participants if you need to send a private message during the call.

Overall, making a conference call with Skype is a straightforward and user-friendly process. Whether you're working remotely, trying to arrange a meeting with remote clients, or just catching up with friends and family, Skype has you covered. So why not give it a try and see just how easy it is to stay connected with the people who matter most?

Skype is a good tool for organizing conference calls. Since it's a popular service, you're likely to find people you want to add to your group call using the app. It's also available on multiple platforms, and calling other Skype users is free. This holds true for individuals and businesses alike. In this guide, we show you how to set up a group call using Skype, whether you're on a desktop or mobile device.

 
##   Participate in a Conference Call  
 

You can have up to 50 participants on an audio conference call, including yourself. The maximum number of video streams you can have on a call varies depending on the platform and device you use. The other participants need to be in your contacts list, so make sure you add them before you initiate the call. People who don't have Skype can join the group call using the app's web client. In this case, they join as a visitor, and no login is needed.

 
The information in this guide applies to all versions of Skype.
 

Before starting any conference call, make sure you have a stable internet connection, the latest version of Skype, and a working microphone.

 
Group calls with more than 25 participants are ringless. Instead, people receive a notification that the call started and can select the Join Call button when ready. If you start a video call with less than 25 participants, you can choose whether or not to go ringless.
