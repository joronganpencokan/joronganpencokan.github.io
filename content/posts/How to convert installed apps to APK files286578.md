You might be changing your Android or you’re just backing up all your 3rd party apps; no matter the reason, you will need APK or the apps to be able to do so. Getting the APK of the apps that are installed in your Android is not that complicated, but it is not so straight forward either. This guide will help you with it. Here’s How to convert installed apps to APK files.
 
## Convert Installed Apps to APK Files
 
But before we begin, let’s get a basic understanding of APK. Android Package or Android Application Package is a compressed file that consists of the data necessary for the app to run properly. The files inside it are extracted to the Android device to let the user run that particular app. Backing up the APK of an app doesn’t necessarily back up the data that was added after the user started using the app. You will only get the factory version of the app if you restore the backed up APK.
 
You can easily share the APK with other Android devices that are inaccessible to the internet and are in need of the app that you have installed. You back up all the apps on your Android and transfer it to your new phone. The app can be modified by modifying its APK.
 
There are a couple of methods you can use to convert an app to APK.
 
### Using Es File Explorer to convert installed apps to APK
 
You probably already have ES File Explorer on your Android. Using this file manager, you can easily convert installed apps to APK, the app has a dedicated function that does so. Follow the steps below;
 
Step 1: Open ES File Explorer.
 

 
Step 2: Tap on App from the homepage. If you can’t find it, slide the side panel and tap on App.
 
Step 3: You will get the list of all the app installed on your Android. You want to select the apps that you want to convert to APK and then tap the backup button. You can also just copy the app and paste it on a folder of your choice.
 
Step 4: If you choose to backup route, you can find the APKs on Backups > Apps.
 
### Using Solid Explorer to get the APKs of the installed apps
 
This method is similar to the previous one. If you use Solid Explorer, you can get the APKs of the installed apps and system apps just by tapping a few times.
 
Step 1: Open Solid Explorer.
 
Step 2: Slide the side panel by sliding the screen from left to right.
 
 
 
Step 3: Scroll down the panel and tap on Applications.
 
Step 4: You will see folders named System Apps and User Apps. If the APK you’re trying to get is of an app that came with the device, go to System Apps. If you installed the app yourself, go to the User Apps folder.

You can also use a separate dedicated app to get the APKs of the apps installed on your Android. This is the easiest method on this guide as most of the things are done automatically. APK Extractor shows all the user-installed apps and most of the system apps that you can easily convert to APK.

### Using APK Share & Backup
 
There are many apps in the Google Play Store which allows you to convert your installed apps into APK files so that you can share them with other apps or keep them as backups – like the one used on method 3.
