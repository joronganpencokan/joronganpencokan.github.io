# Say Goodbye to Storage Limits: Google Combines Gmail, Drive, and Photos Into One 15GB Powerhouse!

Google has made a big announcement that is sure to make our lives easier, especially those of us who rely on emails, pictures, and documents for work and personal use. The company has combined Gmail, Drive, and Photos into one massive 15GB online storage space. Say goodbye to storage limits and hello to a powerful new system that will make your life easier and more efficient.

The new Google Drive system will provide users with 15GB of free storage space that will be shared between Gmail, Drive, and Photos. That means you will have a lot more space to store your emails, files, and photos without having to worry about running out of storage or having to pay for more space. And if you need more space, you can easily upgrade to a Google One plan, which offers more storage space and extra benefits.

One of the best things about the new Google Drive system is the convenience it offers. You can access your Gmail, Drive, and Photos from one central location, making it easy to manage and organize your files. You can also share files and folders with others, collaborate on documents in real-time, and create backups of your most important files.

The combination of these three services makes Google Drive a truly powerful tool. With Gmail, you can easily send and receive emails, including attachments, and keep your inbox organized with labels and filters. With Drive, you can store all your files in one place, access them from any device, and share them with others. And with Photos, you can easily store, organize, and share your photos with friends and family.

The new Google Drive system also comes with powerful search capabilities. You can search for emails, files, and photos by keyword, date, sender, and more. The search function is also smart enough to recognize images and search for similar ones, making it easy to find what you're looking for.

In conclusion, the new Google Drive system is a game-changer for anyone who uses email, stores files, and takes photos. With 15GB of free storage space, you can store all your important files and never have to worry about running out of space. And with the convenience of having all your files in one central location, you can easily manage and organize them. Say goodbye to storage limits and hello to a powerful new system that will make your life easier and more efficient.

In an effort to stop users from worrying in which service they should save their files, Google just decided that having a separate storage for each of its services isn’t working anymore.
 
So starting now the search engine giant is combining the 10GB space storage from Gmail and with the 5GB of Drive and Google+ Photos into a single storage pool, for a total of 15GB that will be shared among all the services. Now everything will be saved into Google Drive regardless of the type of file.
 
Also Google is revamping its Drive storage page to reflect the new changes and to provide users with useful information about on what service is using the most storage with a pie chart.
 

 
Now is you are pushing closer to the 15GB limit, you can always upgrade the storage capacity; plans starts at $4.99/month for 100GB and $9.99/month for 200GB — which if you think about, it’s a better deal than Dropbox that offers the same capacities but twice as much.
