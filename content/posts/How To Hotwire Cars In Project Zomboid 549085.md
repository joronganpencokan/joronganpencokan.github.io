As the apocalypse rages on, know how to hotwire cars in Project Zomboid to escape the undead!

In the world of Project Zomboid, surviving the apocalypse is a daunting task. Every day is a battle for survival against the never-ending hordes of undead. One of the most critical skills for survival is the ability to hotwire cars quickly and efficiently. In a world where you cannot trust anyone, having an escape vehicle can be the difference between life and death.

To hotwire a car in Project Zomboid, you need to follow some precise steps. First, you must find the car you want to hotwire. Cars can be found on roads, in parking lots, and even in abandoned buildings. Pick a vehicle that is in good condition and has a full gas tank. Damage or low fuel levels can make hotwiring more challenging or not even possible.

The essential tools for hotwiring a car are a screwdriver and a wire. The screwdriver will be used to take off the ignition cover, while the wire will bridge the connection between the battery and starter. If you do not have a screwdriver, a knife or broken glass can also work, but they may cause more damage to the car’s ignition.

Once you have a screwdriver and wire, approach the car and open the driver's door. Look underneath the steering column for the ignition cover. Use your screwdriver to pry it off and expose the wiring inside. Then, find the red wire and the orange wire. The red wire connects to the battery, while the orange wire connects to the starter.

Take the wire and connect the red and orange wires. Doing this bypasses the car's ignition and sends power directly to the starter. This action will start the engine without a key.

Once the engine starts, make sure the coast is clear before driving away. The engine noise can attract zombies, so drive carefully and avoid running over any undead. Having a car can be a valuable resource, but it can also attract unwanted attention. Be careful not to draw too much attention to yourself and your vehicle.

In conclusion, knowing how to hotwire cars in Project Zomboid is a valuable skill that can save your life. Make sure you have the necessary tools and a car in good condition to increase your chances of survival. With these steps in mind, you can hotwire a car quickly and efficiently, leaving the undead in your rearview mirror.
