# Unleash the Fury of Groudon in Pokemon Go - Master its Moves and Dominate Your Opponents with Our Wiki Guide!

Are you ready to dominate the Pokemon Go arena with one of the strongest Pokemon out there? Look no further than Groudon, the legendary Ground-type Pokemon with incredible attack and defense stats. With our wiki guide, you'll learn how to master Groudon's moves and tactics to unleash its fury and take down your opponents.

## Groudon's Stats and Abilities

Before getting into its moves, it's helpful to understand Groudon's stats and abilities. Groudon is a Ground-type Pokemon with a massive 411 base attack and a formidable 297 base defense. This means it can dish out tons of damage while also taking hits like a champ.

Groudon's signature ability is Drought, which permanently sets the weather to sunny conditions. This not only boosts Groudon's Fire-type moves but also weakens Water-type moves used against it. Additionally, Groudon can learn Precipice Blades, a powerful signature move that hits all adjacent opponents with a base power of 120.

## Groudon's Moveset

Now let's dive into Groudon's moves. Here are some of its most potent options:

- Fire Punch: A strong Fire-type move that deals 55 base damage and has a 10% chance to burn the opponent.
- Solar Beam: A devastating Grass-type move that takes one turn to charge up but then deals 120 base damage.
- Earthquake: Arguably Groudon's best move, a Ground-type move with a base power of 120 that hits all adjacent opponents. It also has a 10% chance to cause a magnitude-based earthquake that can deal even more damage.
- Precipice Blades: As mentioned above, Groudon's signature move hits all adjacent opponents with a base power of 120.

Other moves to consider include Stone Edge for a powerful Rock-type option and Dragon Claw for a good Dragon-type move. It's also worth noting that Groudon can learn Fire Blast, a devastating Fire-type move with a base power of 140, but it has lower accuracy at only 85%.

## Tactics for Dominating with Groudon

Now that you have an understanding of Groudon's stats and moveset, let's talk about some tactics for taking down your opponents.

First and foremost, take advantage of Groudon's Drought ability to boost its Fire-type moves and weaken Water-type moves. This makes Fire Punch an especially effective option. However, be aware that the sunny conditions may also boost the opponent's Fire-type moves as well.

Next, consider pairing Groudon with a Pokemon that can counter its weaknesses. Groudon is weak to Water, Grass, and Ice-type moves, so consider having a Pokemon with strong Electric-type moves (to counter Water and Ice) or a strong Flying-type move (to counter Grass).

Finally, use Groudon's Earthquake move to hit all adjacent opponents and deal massive damage. If you're facing a double battle or raid boss with multiple opponents, this move can be a game-changer.

## Conclusion

Groudon is an incredibly powerful Pokemon with the potential to dominate the Pokemon Go arena. With our wiki guide, you'll be able to master its moves and tactics to unleash its fury and take down your opponents. So get out there, catch a Groudon, and become a Pokemon Go master!
