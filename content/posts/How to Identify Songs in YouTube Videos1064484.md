# Unlock the Secret Tool to Identify Any Song Playing in Youtube Videos!

As a music lover, have you ever come across a video on Youtube where the background music is just so catchy that you can't help but wonder what song is playing? Or maybe you have seen a Youtube video where the soundtrack is playing but without any lyrics, and you're not sure which song it is. If this sounds like you, then you're in luck because there's a secret tool that can help you identify any song playing in Youtube videos.

The tool is called 'Musipedia,' and it's an online music encyclopedia that allows you to identify any song by humming, singing, or typing in the melody. With Musipedia, you don't need to know the name of the song or the artist, all you need is the melody, and Musipedia will do the rest.

To use Musipedia, go to the website, and you will see a search bar on the homepage. Click on the search bar and select the 'Melody' option. The next step is to hum, whistle, or sing the melody of the song you want to identify. If you're not comfortable humming or singing, type in the rhythm or some of the notes you remember from the song.

Once you have entered the melody, click on the 'Search' button, and Musipedia will show you a list of matching results. The results will include the name of the song, the artist, the genre, and other related information. You can then listen to a sample of the song, confirm if it's the one you're looking for, and voila! You have identified the song playing in the Youtube video.

Musipedia is an amazing tool that can help you identify any song playing in Youtube videos, but that's not all it can do. It's also an excellent resource for anyone interested in music theory, composition, or music history. The website has a vast collection of musical scales, chords, and rhythms that you can explore, and it allows you to create your own musical compositions using the virtual keyboard.

In conclusion, if you ever come across a Youtube video with an unknown soundtrack, don't despair. Just head to Musipedia, and with a little humming or typing, you can unlock the secret tool to identify any song playing in the video. Not only will you satisfy your curiosity but you might also discover new artists and great music along the way.
