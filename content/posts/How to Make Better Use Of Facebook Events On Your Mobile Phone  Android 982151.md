Whether we like it or not, Facebook offers a lot of features that people actually use. As an example, people will use Facebook events to invite everyone to a baby shower or birthday party. For those who are bored, you can also search for interesting public events that are nearby your area to attend.

appoi US for Android is an application that helps you find events based on your location and what you’ve previously liked on Facebook or events you’ve attended. This is a great application for people who love to actually get out and be social.
 
## Getting Started with appoi US
 
After downloading appoi US from the Google Play Store, you will need to grant access to your Facebook account. If you have the Facebook application already installed and are using it on your phone, you won’t need to enter in your e-mail address and password again.
 

 
The next screen is the permissions that you’re actually granting appoi US. As you can see by the screenshot below, appoi US will be able to access your data any time, access posts in your news feed and also post on your behalf.
 
Once you have everything authorized, there’s one last option to say yes or no to – access to your location. For local events, it’s best to let appoi US see where you are located at the moment. A lot of people are keen on the idea of an app knowing where they are so this feature is not necessary.
 
## Using appoi US
 
Using appoi US will let you set calendar appointments for public events you’d like to attend or be reminded of. To help you with this, there are several different views and categories for you to see events that may interest you.
 
The first view is the calendar view. You will have the choice of seeing the calendar of events in a daily or monthly view. Some of the visible events are TV shows, sporting events, and concerts. In the same row as the daily and monthly tabs is also a movies tab. At the time of this writing, there were no movies available to see.
 
The next way to search for events is the recommendation. By clicking “Recommend” on the bottom of the screen, you will see four different category tabs. Clicking on the tab for TV, music, movie or sports will show appropriate events.
 
When you find event of interest, click on the event and you’ll see options to add it to your schedule. Some of the events offer different bits of information. For example a TV show may tell you the time of the show, the cast, the genre and also there may be a link to a description of the episode. For sporting events or concerts, there may be a link to a map location of where the event is being held.
 
When you add an event, it will show up in this application. Both the day and month view of the calendar in appoi US will show the events you’ve chosen to be reminded about. To get reminders of the events you’ve added, you can sync appoi US with your Google calendar. Under the settings tab, select to authorize Google calendar.
 
## Final Thoughts
 
Sometimes the hardest part about making plans, is knowing what’s available. Using Facebook’s vast reach of which events are available, you can schedule your next day off or even make plans to travel to a concert or find something to do on an impromptu weekend road trip.
