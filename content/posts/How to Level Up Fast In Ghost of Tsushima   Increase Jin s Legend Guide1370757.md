# Unleash Jin's Ultimate Power! Discover the Secret to Leveling Up Fast in Ghost of Tsushima!


As a Samurai warrior on the brink of conflict and war, you must constantly level up your skills, strength, and courage in order to defeat your enemies and save your people from peril. In Ghost of Tsushima, leveling up is a key element to becoming an unstoppable force on the battlefield, and there are plenty of ways to make this journey easier, but none as vital and rewarding as unlocking Jin's ultimate power.

Jin Sakai, the protagonist of Ghost of Tsushima, starts as a relatively weak warrior who is learning the ropes of combat, but over the course of the game, he gains new abilities and techniques that allow him to become a force to be reckoned with. Jin's ultimate power is one of these abilities, and it is a game-changer.

# What is Jin's Ultimate Power?

Jin's ultimate power is essentially a special move that charges up as you fight enemies. Once charged, you can unleash it, and it will wipe out most, if not all, enemies in the vicinity. It also grants you invincibility during the attack, making it an excellent tool for taking on powerful foes or when you're outmatched.

# How to Unlock Jin's Ultimate Power?

Unlocking Jin's ultimate power is your goal to level up fast in Ghost of Tsushima. It requires a little bit of work and patience, but it is well worth the effort.

First, you must complete the story mission "Blood on the Grass" and reach the end of Act II. Once you've done that, you must start looking for certain items to unlock the technique.

The first item you need is the Mythic tale "The Heavenly Strike," which is given to you by a quest giver named Yamato in the Toyotama region. This tale is not essential to completing the game's story, but it is significant in powering up Jin's abilities.

Once you've started the "Heavenly Strike" mission, you must complete various objectives and track down the six Straw Hat ronin who are in possession of the Heavenly Strike armor. Each ronin is relatively tough, and you'll need to engage them in combat to secure the armor. You'll also need to collect various resources along the way, such as bamboo and yew wood, for upgrading your sword.

After you've obtained the Heavenly Strike armor, you must head back to Yamato and complete the tale. Doing so will unlock the Heavenly Strike technique, which is a pre-requisite for unlock Jin's ultimate power.

Next, you must complete the Mythic Tale "The Unbreakable Gosaku," which is given to you in the act one of the game. This mission will lead you to valuable resources that you need to craft the Gosaku armor. Once you've crafted the armor, you must return to the quest giver Gosaku, who is in charge of making it. The last objective of the mission is to take on the bandits in a final showdown, which can be challenging. But once you've defeated your enemies, you'll unlock Gosaku's Armor, which gives you an extra amount of health and increases your Melee damage.

Now that you have both Heavenly Strike technique and the Gosaku's Armor, you can unlock Jin's ultimate power by performing a specific combination of buttons - R1+L1 - once you've charged up your special move meter. You can charge up quickly by defeating enemies, crafting items, and completing missions.

# Conclusion:

Jin's ultimate power is an incredibly satisfying and effective move that can help you level up quickly and succeed in your battles against the Mongols. By completing the Heavenly Strike and The Unbreakable Gosaku Mythic Tale, unlocking and upgrading Jin's abilities, and charging up your special move meter, you can unleash Jin's ultimate power and blow your enemies off the battlefield.

Don't forget to explore every nook and cranny of the game while enjoying the Ghost of Tsushima's story, visuals, and audio. Whenever stuck or need suggestions, joining online communities, interacting with other players and experts can help you progress, level up fast and may lead you to a more fun and engaging gameplay experience.
