## How to Get Nails in Dinkum
 

 
You can get nails by crafting them in Dinkum. But to do this, you will first need to get tin ore. Here are the steps that you need to follow in order to get tin ore in Dinkum:
 
- Go to the desert area of your island map
 - There should be tons of rocks and boulders with different ores
 - Find and mine the boulders with tin ore
 - Get as many tin ores as you want
 - You must now keep the tin ore in hand
 - Place the ore in the crude furnace to get tin bars

 
You can now use these bars to craft nails on the crafting table. However, you will need to first get a crafting recipe to make these nails. You can do this by going to Fletch. You will also get a wooden crate recipe here.
 
Now, that you have the nail recipe, you can convert one tin bar into eight nails. So get on crafting! Don’t forget to check your Adventure journal to claim the rewards for your hard work!
