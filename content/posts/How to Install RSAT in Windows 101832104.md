For those who don't know, Rsat stands for Remote Server Administration Tools. It is a collection of tools that enable administrators to remotely manage Windows Servers from their local computers. With Rsat, you can access and manage Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, Hyper-V, and other server roles.

But why is installing Rsat important? Well, it can save you a lot of time and effort, especially if you have multiple servers to manage.

Step 2: Install the Rsat tools

Once you have downloaded the installer, run it and choose the features you want to install. You can select all the tools or just the ones you need. The installer will take care of the rest.

Step 3: Enable the Rsat tools

After the installation is complete, you need to enable the Rsat tools. To do this, go to Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features. Click on "Turn Windows features on or off" and then expand "Remote Server Administration Tools". Select the tools you want to enable and click OK.

And that's it! You have now installed and enabled Rsat in Windows 10. You can now access the tools from your Start menu or by typing their names in the search bar.

This article covers how to install Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) on a Windows 10 computer and includes information on versions and compatibility.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Press the Windows Key; search for "manage optional features" and open the result; click Add a feature, and search for "RSAT."Adding RSAT within Windows only works in Windows 10 version 1809 and above.Earlier Windows 10 copies need to download the tools from Microsoft and can only control older Windows Server versions.

 
##   How to Install RSAT in Windows 10  
 

If you're looking to control Windows Server from within Windows 10, you'll need Microsoft's Remote Server Administration Tools. These tools are commonly known as RSAT, a compilation of the various applications and services required to control Windows Server.

 
### 
Note
 
Running a copy of Windows older than build 1809? You'll not only have to download the tools directly from Microsoft and can only control older versions of Windows Server, but unfortunately, in older copies of Windows 10, you can only install RSAT in Windows 10 Professional and Windows 10 Enterprise.
 

With a copy of Windows updated since the October 2018 Update (1809), setting these tools up takes just a few seconds within Windows and can control Windows Server 2019 as well as earlier versions.

 

In the past, installing tools like these would require downloads from Microsoft's site. But since the October 2018 Update, you can do this from within Windows itself.

 
- Press the Windows Key, search for "manage optional features," and press Enter.
 - At the top of the newly opened window, select Add a feature.
 - In the search box, type in "RSAT," check each tool you'd like to install, and then click Install.
 - If there's no option for RSAT, this means your Windows installation is out of date. Check what version of Windows you have to make sure you're running Windows 10 Professional or Windows 10 Enterprise.
 - If you're running Windows 10 Professional or Windows 10 Enterprise, you can download the RSAT tool on Microsoft's website. Once downloaded, open the files, and follow along with the prompts onscreen to install them.

 
##   Notes on RSAT Versions and Compatibility  
 

With an up-to-date copy of Windows 10, you can both install RSAT and use them to manage Windows Server 2019 as well as previous Windows Server versions. Installing RSAT within Windows doesn't give you the option to install different versions of the tools.

 

Press the Windows Key, search for "manage optional features," and press Enter.

 

At the top of the newly opened window, select Add a feature.

 

In the search box, type in "RSAT," check each tool you'd like to install, and then click Install.

 

If there's no option for RSAT, this means your Windows installation is out of date. Check what version of Windows you have to make sure you're running Windows 10 Professional or Windows 10 Enterprise.

 

If you're running Windows 10 Professional or Windows 10 Enterprise, you can download the RSAT tool on Microsoft's website. Once downloaded, open the files, and follow along with the prompts onscreen to install them.

 
Not on build 1809 and don't have Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise? You can always update your copy of Windows and then install RSAT from within Windows. You'll have to go through Windows Update to update your copy of Windows.
 

However, if you download the tools from Microsoft's website, there are two primary options you'll have to choose between the WS_1803 RSAT package and the WS2016 RSAT package.

 

If you're running Windows 10 version 1803 (the April 2018 Update) or earlier, download the WS_1803 RSAT package to manage Windows Server version 1803 or 1709. If you're on 1803 but want to manage Windows Server 2016 and earlier, download the WS2016 RSAT package.
