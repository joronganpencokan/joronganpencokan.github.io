# Revolutionize Your Meetings: Learn How To Make A Conference Call With Google Voice!

Are you tired of the hassle of organizing in-person meetings? Or, are you having difficulty connecting with your clients or colleagues who are located in different parts of the world? Look no further than Google Voice, an innovative solution for all your conference call needs.

With Google Voice, you can host high-quality conference calls without any complicated hardware or software installations. The best part is that it's free! Unlike traditional phone lines, Google Voice uses VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), which enables you to make and receive calls over the internet, eliminating the need for extra equipment.

Here's how to make a conference call with Google Voice:

1. Sign up for Google Voice.

First, you need to sign up for a Google Voice account. You can do this by going to the Google Voice website and following the prompts to create your account. You will need a Google account to use Google Voice, so be sure to sign up for one if you haven't already.

2. Add participants to the call.

Once you’ve signed up, you can initiate a conference call by adding the participants’ phone numbers to the call. Do this by clicking on the "New Call" button on the Google Voice home page and typing in the phone numbers of the participants. To add more than one participant, separate each number with a comma.

3. Set up the conference call.

After you’ve added the participants, you can set up the conference call by clicking the "Call" button. Google Voice will then call you and connect you to each participant. The participants will receive a call from an unfamiliar number, which they should answer to connect to the conference call.

4. Manage the conference call.

Google Voice has plenty of helpful features to help you manage your conference call. For example, you can mute or unmute participants, add or remove participants, and record the call if needed. You can do all of this during the call by clicking on the "Manage Participants" button on the screen.

5. End the conference call.

When you're ready to end the call, simply hang up. Google Voice will automatically disconnect from all the participants, and you will receive a summary of the call, including the duration and the participants who attended.

With Google Voice, you can have a productive and efficient conference call experience without having to worry about the traditional hassles associated with organizing in-person meetings. Not only is it free, but it's also incredibly easy to use.

In conclusion, Revolutionize your meetings with Google Voice conference calls. You can save time and money by connecting seamlessly with all the participants without the need for any complicated hardware or software. Try it now and see the difference for yourself!

##   What's Required to Make a Google Voice Conference Call?  
 

All that's needed to make a Google Voice conference call is a Google account and a computer, smartphone, or tablet with the app installed. You can get the Google Voice app for iOS and Android devices and through the web on a computer. The same is accurate for Hangouts; iOS, Android, and web users can use it.

##   The Limitations of Google Voice  
 

Google Voice is not primarily a conferencing service. Still, it's a beneficial way to use your phone number on all of your devices. Use it as a simple and easy way to make a group phone call.

 

Unlike full-fledged conference tools, Google Voice doesn't have tools to manage the conference call and its participants. There isn't a facility to schedule the call and have the participants invited in advance through email, for example.

 
A group conference call with Google Voice is limited to 10 people on the call at once (or 25 with a paid account).
 

Despite the lack of extra features that you might find on other services (Skype has better options for conference calling), Google Voice's simple and straightforward conferencing ability that anyone with the essential devices can participate in makes it an appealing option. Because it integrates with your smartphone and lets you use a variety of devices, it does its job well as a central calling service.
