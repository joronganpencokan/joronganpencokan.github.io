Unlock the Ultimate Gaming Experience: Learn the Secret to Invite Friends and Conquer Gotham Knights Together!

Gaming has always been a popular pastime, but during the pandemic, it has become more than that. For many, it has provided an escape from reality, a way to connect with friends and family in a virtual world, and a source of entertainment that can last for hours. With games like Gotham Knights looming on the horizon, it is time to learn the secret to invite friends and conquer the game together!

The world of Gotham Knights is vast and filled with danger, but with the right tactics and strategies, you and your team of friends can take on any challenge. Whether it is battling one of the game’s many villains or traversing the sprawling city, Gotham Knights’ cooperative gameplay is designed to be shared with friends.

So, how exactly do you invite your friends to join your team and start playing Gotham Knights together? The process is quite simple, but it does require some basic knowledge of the game’s mechanics.

First, you will need to have a multiplayer lobby set up. This can be done in the game’s menu, which will allow you to invite other players to join your team. Once you have created your lobby, you will need to send an invite to your friends. This can be done through various means, such as the game’s friends list, or by inviting them directly through your chosen gaming platform.

Once your friends have joined your game, it is time to start exploring Gotham. Together, you can embark on quests, hunt down villains, and help the citizens of Gotham while experiencing the game’s thrilling combat and gorgeous graphics.

One of the primary benefits of playing Gotham Knights with friends is the added sense of teamwork and camaraderie. Players can work together to support one another and tackle challenges that would be impossible alone. This collaborative approach to gaming creates a stronger sense of community and adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the game.

In addition to the cooperative gameplay, Gotham Knights also features a robust skill and leveling system. Players will be able to upgrade their characters, unlocking new abilities and customizing their playstyle. By working together with your friends, you can strategize and coordinate your upgrades to create a balanced and effective team.

Overall, Gotham Knights promises to be an exciting and memorable gaming experience. By inviting your friends to join in on the action, you can unlock the full potential of the game and create lasting memories with your fellow players. So, gather your friends and get ready to conquer Gotham together!

Gotham Knights allows you to invite a friend to fight crime together to enjoy its co-op multiplayer. This feature is neat because you can complete the entire story with another friend. Especially since you get to choose from 4 of the most iconic characters from the Batman universe. So let us quickly check how you can invite friends in Gotham Knights and play Coop Multiplayer.
 
## How to Invite a Friend in Gotham Knights
 
You can invite a Friend in Gotham Knights after you unlock this feature by completing chapter 1.2 of the game. These are the steps you have to follow:
 
- Start the game and load your progress.
 - Now, pause the game to open the Menu.
 - Here, click on the Social tab.
 - Head to the Friends tab by pressing R1 on PlayStation or RB on Xbox.
 - Here you can find all your friends that are online and offline.
 - Check for your friend that is online and is at least level 2.
 - Select the friend and click and hold the invite button. This is X on PlayStation and A on Xbox.
 - The friend that receives the invite has to be online and go to the Friends tab and accept the invitation.

 
Only after one invites and the other accepts the invitation can the friends play coop in Gotham Knights. Currently the game only supports two-player co-op for its multiplayer. So you will need to wait for the Heroic Assault mode to release which will let you play with 4 players.
 
### Can you Play Gotham Knights with Cross-Platform Friends?
 
No, Gotham Knights does not support cross-platform multiplayer. So PC players can only play with their friends on PC. Similarly, PS5 players can only play with PS5 players. And Xbox players can only play with their Xbox friends. There is also no cross-progression as the game is only for the current generation consoles. So PS4 and Xbox One aren’t supported by it.
 
### Can you Play Couch Co-op?
 
No, even though this game has excellent support to play the story mode with friends. This game does not support local multiplayer or any form of couch co-op. But while it is not in the game now, the developers could add it in the future. Though they haven’t hinted about any such upcoming feature yet.
