Are you looking to install Windows 11 on your Raspberry Pi 4? Not only is this a fun project to try, but it also opens up a world of possibilities if you need a pocket-sized PC.
 
With our guide, you’ll learn how to bypass Microsoft’s stringent requirements and install Windows 11 on your Raspberry Pi 4. The best part is that you can do the installation from a Raspberry Pi or a PC without too many commands or technical skills.
 
## Requirements for Installing Windows 11 on Raspberry Pi
 
- Raspberry Pi 4 – Both the 4GB and 8GB Pi versions will work. But for a smoother experience go with 8GB. Also, you’ll need to install and set up Raspberry Pi OS.External SSD drive or USB flash drive – This is where you’ll install Windows 11. We recommend going with an external SSD drive since it will improve the performance of your system. The drive should be at least 64GB.SD Card – If you want to install Windows 11 directly from the Raspberry Pi, you’ll need a decent SD card to host Raspberry Pi OS.USB Keyboard, USB Mouse, and an HDMI Monitor.Raspberry Pi firmware that is up-to-date.Reliable internet connection, either Wi-Fi or Ethernet.Windows PC if you want to install Windows 11 from another Windows PC.

 
## Update Your Raspberry Pi to the Latest Firmware
 
To enable your Raspberry Pi 4 to boot from USB, you need to ensure it has the latest firmware. So before anything you will need to update your device to the latest firmware.
 
Open a “Terminal” window and enter the following commands.
 
This will update all the installed packages to the latest version and restart the device. 
 
## Install Windows 11 on Raspberry Pi
 
There are two options when it comes to getting Windows 11 to run on your Raspberry Pi 4, and we’ll detail both in what follows. We’ll start with the more convenient route.
 
### Method 1: From Raspberry Pi OS
 
Installing directly from the Raspberry Pi OS is the easiest way to install Windows on a Raspberry Pi 4. The only drawback is that it’s slow compared to installing from a PC. Here’s how to go about it:
 
- WoR (Windows on Raspberry Pi) is a tool for installing Windows 11 on a USB disk. To get started, open “Terminal” and then go ahead and install WoR Flasher using the following command.

 
- Run WoR Flasher with the command below. Press Y when prompted to complete the installation.

 
- In the WoR window that pops up, select Windows 11 and Pi4/400 respectively. Click “Next”.

 
- Select a language and then choose where you want to install Windows 11. Make sure the USB drive is connected. Now choose the drive where you want to install Windows 11 on and then press “Next”.

 
- On the next screen press “Flash”.

 
Be patient as WoR Flasher installs Windows. The time it takes will depend on the speed of your internet connection and the USB drive you’re using. Keep the Raspberry Pi powered on throughout the installation process.
 
If you’re having trouble, check our guide on booting your Raspberry Pi from USB.
 
- Power off the Raspberry Pi 4 and remove the SD card running Raspberry Pi OS. Connect the USB drive you flashed in the previous step to the Raspberry Pi via USB3 before powering it on. After the Pi starts, use the Windows Installation Wizard to set up Windows.

 
- After setup is complete, you’ll see the Windows 11 user interface.

 
### Method 2: From Another Windows PC
 
Installing Windows 11 to your Raspberry Pi 4 from another PC is much faster than using the Raspberry Pi OS method due to the more powerful processor. Even then, it’s slightly more complicated. Here’s how to go about it:
 
- Go to UUPdump and enter “Windows 11 arm” in the search bar.

 
- Now select your language and the version of Windows you want to install (we’ve selected the latest build for arm64 version). Click “Next” to proceed.

 
- Select “Download and Convert to ISO” and click on “Create download package.” A zip file will download to your PC.

 
- Extract the zip file and run the “uup_download_windows.cmd” script as administrator. The script will download all Windows components and create a Windows 11 ARM ISO file.

 
- Download WoR imager and extract the files. After you’re done, run the “WoR.exe” file as administrator. Select your language of choice and then click “Next”.Now choose the “Storage drive” (the USB drive you’re flashing Windows 11 into) and the “Device type” (Raspberry Pi 4).

 
- Select the Windows 11 ARM ISO file you created. You’ll find it in the UUPdump script folder. The “Windows edition” field below will then auto-populate. Click “Next” to proceed.

 
- Select the drivers to be installed. Choose the “Use the latest package available on the server” option. Read and accept the terms to proceed. Click “Next”.

 
- Next, in the UEFI Firmware tab, go for the “Use the latest firmware available on the server” option.

 
- Give it some time to download the drivers and click “Next”. On the next page, you’ll get an overview of the configuration settings. Click “Next”.You’ll be taken the installation overview screen. Confirm that everything is in order, and then click “Install” to kickstart the installation. This process will take some time, depending on how fast your drive is.

 
- Plug the USB drive into your Raspberry Pi 4 and then boot it up. The Windows Wizard will guide you through the Windows 11 setup process.

 
- After setup is complete, you’ll be able to boot into Windows 11.

 
The process of setting up Windows on the Raspberry Pi is pretty much the same as that of setting up Windows on a PC.
