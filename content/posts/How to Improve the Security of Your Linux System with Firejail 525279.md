Protect Your Linux System Like a Pro with One Simple Trick! Learn How to Use Firejail Now

Are you concerned about the security of your Linux system and want to protect it like a pro? If so, then you need to learn how to use Firejail. Firejail is a simple yet powerful tool that can help you protect your system from various security threats with just one simple trick. 

Firejail is a sandboxing program that can be used to isolate your applications and restrict their access to system resources. It creates a container for your applications, which makes it more difficult for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities in your system or applications. This means that if an application is compromised, the attacker will be confined to the sandbox and won't have access to the rest of your system.

Using Firejail is easy. It works by using a command line interface, and you can run Firejail with any program that you want to protect. For example, if you want to open Firefox in a Firejail sandbox, simply type the following command:

$ firejail firefox

This will start Firefox in a sandbox, and any modifications made to the Firefox profile will only be visible in the sandbox. If you have any add-ons or extensions installed, they will only be loaded in the sandbox as well. 

By default, Firejail restricts access to various system resources, such as the network and file system. This makes it more difficult for attackers to access sensitive data on your system. You can also customize the level of access that an application has to these resources, allowing you to tailor the protection to your needs.

Another benefit of Firejail is that it can help protect against zero-day exploits. Zero-day exploits are vulnerabilities in software that are unknown to the software vendor or end-user. By isolating your applications in a sandbox, Firejail can help prevent attackers from exploiting these vulnerabilities.

In addition to protecting your Linux system, Firejail can also be used to protect your privacy online. For example, if you want to use Tor Browser to browse the internet anonymously, you can use Firejail to prevent any data leaks or tracking attempts. 

In conclusion, Firejail is a powerful tool that can help you protect your Linux system like a pro. It's easy to use, effective, and customizable, making it a great addition to any security-conscious user's toolkit. So don't wait any longer, learn how to use Firejail now and start enjoying a more secure and private computing experience!

Linux is always perceived as a more secure OS than its counterparts. However, that doesn’t mean it’s completely immune to viruses, worms, and other evil stuff. Like any other operating system, it has its own set of limitations, and a lot is dependent on how the individual uses it.
 
Of course, nothing can guarantee absolute protection, but there are ways that make life very hard for viruses, worms, and hackers in general. If you are looking for such a solution, look no further, as in this tutorial we’ll be discussing a software, called Firejail, that can improve the security of your Linux system.
 
## Improve your system’s security
 
In order to boost your Linux box’s security, you need to install and use Firejail. It’s basically an SUID program that restricts the running environment of untrusted applications, reducing the risk of security breaches. Behind the scenes, what Firejail does is it enables a process as well as its children to have their own private view of the globally-shared kernel resources, including the network stack, process table, and mount table.
 
The application is written in C language and doesn’t have any dependencies. Of course, it has some requirements. For example, it’s only compatible with Linux machines running a 3.x kernel version or newer. As for what kind of processes the tool can sandbox, the answer is “any.” Yes, you can use it with servers and graphical applications, as well as games and user login sessions.
 
## Installation
 
The utility can be downloaded from the project’s SourceForge page or from the Download section on the tool’s official website.
 
The download page comes with .tar, .deb and .rpm packages and also for both 32- and 64-bit architecture. Since I am using Ubuntu, I downloaded the .deb package and installed it using the GDebi package installer.
 
## Usage
 
Now, to sandbox a process, all you have to do is to pass the corresponding application’s name as an argument to the firejail command. For example, to sandbox the Firefox web browser using Firejail, run the following command:
 

 
While the output logs on the command line should be enough to give you the idea that Firefox is now running in a sandboxed form, to see how Firejail restricts the web browser’s access, try opening a file (File -> Open) from the Firefox window. You’ll see that the list of locations available to the app has been curtailed.
 
For comparison, here’s the list when Firefox is run without Firejail.
 
It’s worth mentioning that Firejail mounts a temporary “tmpfs” filesystem on top of the “/home/user” directory. Any files created in this directory will be deleted once the sandbox exits.
 
The tool includes security profiles for a large number of Linux programs. To give you a better idea on what exactly security profiles are, think of them as configuration files that contain rules defining, for example, which file accesses are allowed and which are not. For more information on Firejail sandboxing as well as how to create and customize security profiles, head to the tool’s documentation.
 
Those who aren’t much into the command line will be glad to know that there is a GUI for the Firejail security sandbox, and it’s known as Firetools. Built using Qt4/Qt5 libraries, this tool comes as a separate package. It provides a sandbox launcher integrated with the system tray, sandbox editing, management, and statistics.
 
To install Firetools, head to this page, download the package compatible with your system, and install accordingly. Once you are done with the installation part, run the utility using the following command:
 
## Conclusion
 
It doesn’t matter which OS you are using, – you should never let the security aspect slip from your mind in the first place. And if your system contains sensitive information in the form of, say, documents, files, or pictures, system security should be at the top of your priority list. For Linux, the solution we’ve discussed in this article is easy to set up and use. Plus, a lot of documentation is available on it in case you need help. Do give it a try.
