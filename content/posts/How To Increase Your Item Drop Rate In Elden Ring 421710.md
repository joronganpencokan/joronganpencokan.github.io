Elden Ring is an action role-playing video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. In this game, players will have to fight against enemies and bosses to progress through the story. Along the way, players will be able to obtain various items that can help improve their stats, weapons, and armor. However, getting these items can sometimes be a challenge, especially when the item drop rate is low. In this article, we'll share some pro tips on how to boost your item drop rate in Elden Ring and unlock hidden secrets that you may have missed.

## 1. Use Consumables and Equipment that Boost Item Discovery

One of the easiest ways to increase your item drop rate is by using consumables and equipment that boost item discovery. The most common consumable that increases item discovery is the Gold Coin. Gold Coins can be found throughout the game, and you can also purchase them from some merchants. When used, a Gold Coin will temporarily increase your item discovery stat, making it easier to obtain rare items.

In addition to consumables, some equipment also increases your item discovery. For example, the Covetous Serpent Ring is a ring that boosts item discovery by 50%. This ring can be found in a hidden location in the game, but it's definitely worth seeking out if you want to increase your odds of finding rare items.

## 2. Take Advantage of NPC Questlines

Many NPCs in Elden Ring have unique items that they will only give you if you complete their questline. These items can be some of the rarest and most powerful in the game. However, to get them, you need to follow the NPC's storyline and complete their tasks. Completing an NPC's questline also often unlocks hidden secrets and areas in the game.

## 3. Farm Enemies with High Drop Rates

Certain enemies in Elden Ring have a higher drop rate for specific items. For example, if you need Titanite Shards to upgrade your weapon, you should farm the Dreglings in the first area of the game. These enemies have a high drop rate for Titanite Shards and can be easily farmed by continually respawning them in the area.

Similarly, if you need Large Titanite Shards, you should farm the Dark Knights in the Cathedral of the Sacred Storm area. These enemies have a high chance of dropping Large Titanite Shards, making them an excellent farming source for that item.

## 4. Join Covenant Factions

Joining covenant factions in Elden Ring can give you access to unique items and weapons that you won't find anywhere else. For example, joining the Covenant of the Greatwolf gives you access to unique weapons, armor, and spells that you can't obtain by any other means.

In addition to unique items, covenant factions can also increase your item drop rate. Each covenant has its own unique rewards for completing their objectives, including boosting item discovery.

## In Conclusion

By following the tips listed in this article, you can increase your chances of obtaining rare items and unlocking hidden secrets in Elden Ring. Remember to use consumables and equipment that boost item discovery, take advantage of NPC questlines, farm enemies with high drop rates, and join covenant factions to get unique items and weapons. With these strategies in your game plan, you'll be able to progress through the game with ease and enjoy all of its hidden secrets.

Elden Ring is an action role-playing game set in the Lands Between. As such you will need the best weapons & armor to survive against the hordes of enemies. But it may be the case where you are farming for certain items but on get it in multiple tries. Let’s say, you are trying to get a rare drop from Enemies but it takes a lot of time to get it as it drops rarely. This is due to your Discovery Stat being low. With a Higher Discovery Stat, you will be able to get rarer items faster. In this guide, I will show you how to Increase Item Drop Rate in Elden Ring.
 
## How to Increase Your Item Drop Rate in Elden Ring
 

 
The Discovery Stat in Elden Ring is an attribute that is responsible for the drop rate for items. The higher this Stat is, the more rare items you will get. You cannot invest points in it directly but there are ways of increasing it. For one, the Discovery Stat is in a 1-to-1 ratio with your Arcane stat. The max you can get your Discovery to is 199 if your Arcane is at 99. This is an ideal situation but the case is true for Arcane builds as they rely on Arcane. If you cannot invest in Arcane then don’t worry, there are other ways to increase your Item Drop Rate in Elden Ring.
 
### Items you should use for Discovery
 
You can use Consumables, Talismans, & Armor pieces to boost your Discovery Stat. In Consumables, you will have to use the Silver-Pickled Fowl Foot. It is a craftable item from the Missionary’s Cookbook[3]. This will grant you 50 points into Discovery. In terms of Talismans, the Silver Scarab is what you should be using. You can find it after getting the Haligtree Secret Medallion. Use the Medallion in the Grand lift of Rold and follow the Hidden Path to the Haligtree. On the way, there will be a Staircase on the left. Climb the first flight of stairs to a platform. On the left there will be a broken railing, jump down from there. There will be an invisible platform. Follow the path and break the illusionary Wall. Behind it is a Chest containing the Silver Scarab.
 
The last thing you can use to increase your Item Drop Rate in Elden Ring is by wearing an Armor that boosts Arcane. There are many Helmets like the Witch’s Glintstone Crown, Mask of Confidence, & the Albinauric Mask but the best one you should be using is the Silver Tear Mask. To get this Helmet, you will have to beat the Mimic Tear boss in Nokron City. You will find the Boss in Nokron City, in the Southmost room on the western landmass. the Silver Tear Mask will boost your Discovery Stat by 8 points. This is a small increase, granted, but every bit of increase will help you in the long run.
