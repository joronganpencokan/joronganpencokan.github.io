If you have been using Snapchat for a while, you might know about the ‘Snapchat Story’ feature. The snaps on Snapchat get deleted right after you view them, but the stories disappear after 24 hours. The story could be anything; it could be a GIF, image, or video. Everything shared as a story will be shown for only 24 hours on a user account.
Let’s admit, while using Snapchat, we often come across a fantastic story that we want to save.

Here are some of the best Snapchat Story Saver apps you can use.

 
#### 1. Snapbox



Well, Snapbox is one of the best Android apps that can be used to save someone else’s Snapchat Story. However, the app has been removed from the Google Play Store due to some definite reason.
