On Windows 11, it’s possible to make the Windows Terminal app the default experience to open and run Command Prompt, PowerShell, and Linux commands instead of the legacy Windows Console Host.
 
This guide will teach you the steps to set the modern Windows Terminal app the default experience on Windows 11.
 
## Configure Windows Terminal as the new default app on Windows 11
 
To make the Windows Terminal app the new default command-line experience, use these steps:

Once you complete the steps, the next time you try to open Command Prompt, PowerShell, or a Windows Subsystem for Linux distro, the experience will open with the Windows Terminal app.
