Stop Wasting Your Data! Discover the Secret to Limiting Windows Update Bandwidth in Windows 10 Now!

Are you tired of losing valuable data whenever your Windows 10 updates? It can be frustrating, especially if you work from home or depend on your internet connection for your daily tasks. Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem. By limiting Windows Update Bandwidth, you can save your data and work without disruptions.

Here's what you need to know about Windows Update Bandwidth and how to limit it:

What is Windows Update Bandwidth?

Whenever your Windows 10 computer downloads an update, it uses a portion of your internet connection or data plan. This process is known as Windows Update Bandwidth. It happens automatically, which means you might not notice it until it's too late. Depending on your internet plan, this could result in hefty bills from your service provider.

Why You Should Limit Windows Update Bandwidth

Limiting Windows Update Bandwidth is essential for anyone who wants to avoid unexpected internet expenses. If you use a metered connection or have a limited bandwidth plan, Windows Update can consume all of your data, leaving you with nothing. Additionally, it can slow down your internet speed since most Windows updates are large files.

How to Limit Windows Update Bandwidth in Windows 10

Fortunately, Microsoft has made it easy for you to limit your Windows Update Bandwidth after the release of Windows 10 Creators Update. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Click on Start and type "Settings" in the search bar.
2. In the Settings menu, click on "Update & Security."
3. In the "Update & Security" menu, select "Advanced options."
4. Under "Advanced options," click on "Delivery Optimization."
5. Choose "Advanced options" at the bottom of the Delivery Optimization window.
6. Under "Advanced options," turn on "Limit how much bandwidth is used for downloading updates in the background."

By doing that, you limit the percentage of your bandwidth that Windows Update can use while downloading updates in the background. You can set the limit to any percentage between 5% and 100%, depending on your internet connection speed and data plan.

Conclusion

Limiting Windows Update Bandwidth is an effective way to save your data and avoid unpleasant surprises. By following the steps outlined above, you can set a limit on how much bandwidth Windows Update can use. Additionally, it can improve your internet speed as updates won't consume all your bandwidth. Don't let your Windows updates waste your valuable data – limit your Windows Update Bandwidth today.

In general, Windows updates range anywhere from a few megabytes to a few hundred megabytes. Though the updates are not a bad thing, the thing that bothers most people is that Windows 10 hogs all the bandwidth while downloading updates. This makes other Internet activities like browsing and streaming videos slow and painful.
 
In theory, Windows dynamically adjusts how much bandwidth it uses when downloading updates so that you can browse the Internet without any hiccups. But it almost never works due to the size and frequency of the updates. Making matters worse, we have to endure this almost every week, and there is no simple way to pause the downloading of Windows updates. (You can defer Windows updates, though.)
 
Microsoft added a new feature in the recent Fall Creators Update that allows you to set how much bandwidth Windows can use while downloading the updates. Here’s how to enable it and limit bandwidth for Windows updates.
 
## Check Your Windows 10 Version
 
To limit the Windows update bandwidth, you need to have Fall Creators Update installed. You can confirm whether you’re using Fall Creators Update or not by checking the version number. To check your Windows version, press Win + R, type winver and press the Enter button on your keyboard.
 
The above action will open the “About Windows” window. You can see the version number on the second line. The version number should be “1709” or above.
 

 
Once you’ve confirmed you are using Windows 10 with Fall Creators Update, you can proceed to the next step.
 
## Limit Bandwidth for Windows Update
 
Thankfully, you don’t have to mess with Windows Registry or the Group Policy Editor to limit the Windows update bandwidth. In fact, Microsoft made it a part of the Delivery Optimization settings. However, the setting is buried deep down and can be hard to find if you don’t know where to look.
 
To open the Settings app, click on the Notifications icon and then the “All Settings” option. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Win + I.
 
In the Settings window, open “Update and Security.”
 
Navigate to “Windows Update” appearing in the left panel. Scroll down on the right panel and click on the link “Advanced Options” under Update Settings.
 
In this window click on the link “Delivery Optimization.”
 
Here, click on the link “Advanced Options.”
 
Select the checkbox “Limit how much bandwidth is used for downloading updates in the background,” and use the slider to set the limit. As you can see from the below image, I’ve limited Windows to use only 30% of my bandwidth.
 
If you want, you can also set upload limits. To do that, scroll down, select the option “Limit how much bandwidth is used for uploading updates to other PCs on the Internet” and use the slider. You can also set the monthly upload limit by selecting the option “Monthly Upload Limit.” Do note that these settings are only applicable if you’ve enabled Windows to upload updates to other PCs on the Internet.
