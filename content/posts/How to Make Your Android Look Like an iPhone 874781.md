The iPhone is an excellent phone with an attractive design. If you are tired of how your Android phone looks or just amazed at how customizable your Android phone is, there are plenty of apps you can install to make your Android phone look like an iPhone (or any other phone).
 
## Phone 12 Launcher
 
To make your Android device look like an iPhone, you’re going to need the Phone 12 Launcher. Right after you install the app, you’ll feel that you’re already looking at an iPhone. The app icons will change to the ones you would see on an iPhone.
 
The launcher has support for its widgets apart from the Android ones. There is also a left panel that has shortcuts to apps such as contacts and weather, along with other suggested applications. The app also supports lock screen functionality that displays the Passcode and Pattern Lock.
 
To display the Control Center, the iOS notification bar, you need to grant permission for an overlay on other apps. Also, you can go into the launcher’s settings and modify things such as wallpaper, swipe action, lock screen, app lock, scroll effect, dock, iPhone X notch, and more.
 
## iMusic – Music Player
 
Let’s give that music player an iOS look too. The app you’re going to need is iMusic – Music Player. With this music player, you can listen to audio files with different formats such as WAV, MP3, AAC, FLAC, 3GP, OGG, and MIDI.
 
It gives a great display screen that has the iOS 14, phone 12 Pro Max style. You can also set a sleep timer that sets off a music alarm.
 
Tap on the three dots at the top left to access options such as repeat, shuffle, equalizer and more. You can also search for a specific song in the search bar and get lyrics offline.
 
## iCalendar
 
iCalendar will give you that iOS calendar you’ve always wanted with iOS 14 style. It is compatible with Google Calendar and has an effortless design. It’s easy to read, with a highly usable interface that is useful in entering events quickly. Consequently, you can keep track of your busy schedule and set reminders.
 
When you create an event, you can choose which calendar you want to add it to. You can also have the event repeat and add an alert. When you tap on a date with an event, the event will be displayed below the calendar. It’s a simple app, but it’s great if that’s exactly what you’re looking for.
 
## Wrapping Up
 
In the end, you’re still going to have an Android device, but at least with these apps, you can enjoy the iOS design. Did I miss an app you may be already using? Share it with us in the comments below!
