When you encounter a creature that you wish to capture, hold the vial up to the creature and say "I capture your magic!" The essence of the magical creature will be captured in the vial.

Step Five: Seal and Display The Vial

Seal the vial with a cork or lid and attach the label or tag. Store the vial in a safe place where it can be displayed and admired. You can also use the vial to create magical crafts or add it to a collection of Disney Dreamlight Valley memorabilia.

In conclusion, crafting an empty vial is a fun and magical way to capture the essence of Disney Dreamlight Valley. With these simple steps, you can unleash the magic and create a little piece of Disney wonderment to treasure forever!
