- Select "Add source."

- Enter the repository URL, and don't forget to give it a name.

- Return to the home screen and open "Add-ons."

- Click on the "Package Installer" icon and select "Install from zip file."

- Select the add on repository you have added and click "OK."

Step 3: Install Add-ons

Once you have added the repository, it's time to install add ons that you want! Installing add ons may vary depending on the repository you chose. Here is an example of how to install an add-on after adding the repository:

- Open "Add-ons" from the home screen.

- Click on the package installer icon and select "Install from repository."

- Select the repository you have added and find the add on you want to install.

- Click on the add-on name and select "Install."

- Wait for the add-on installation confirmation message.
