Title: You Won't Believe This Insane Trick To Join Enemy Squads In COD Warzone 2 - Learn How Now!

Introduction:

Are you tired of playing with the same squad every time you log in to COD Warzone 2? Do you want to switch things up and play with your enemies rather than against them? Well, you're in luck because we have discovered an insane trick that will allow you to join the enemy squad and fight alongside them. Keep reading to learn more.

Body:

Step 1: Identify and engage with an enemy player

The first step in joining the enemy squad is to identify an enemy player who is not suspicious of your intentions. Engage with them in a firefight and deal a small amount of damage to them. This will initiate an animation in which the injured player will crawl towards safety to heal. 

Step 2: Approach and execute the injured enemy player

While the injured player is crawling, approach them and press the execute button. This will trigger an animation in which you will execute the injured player and take on their identity. After executing the player, you will have the option to pick up their dropped weapons and equipment.

Step 3: Join the enemy squad

Once you have executed the enemy player and picked up their weapons and equipment, you will be prompted to join their squad. Accept the invitation, and you will now be playing alongside the enemy squad.

Step 4: Watch out for friendly fire

Be cautious when playing alongside the enemy squad, as they may mistake you for one of their own and accidentally or intentionally fire upon you. Keep a close eye on their behavior and try to blend in as much as possible to avoid suspicion.

Conclusion:

Joining the enemy squad in COD Warzone 2 may seem like a far-fetched idea, but with this insane trick, anything is possible. Remember to be cautious and keep a low profile to avoid detection by your enemies. So gear up, execute your enemies, and join the dark side. May the force be with you.

Call of Duty Warzone 2 allows players to join enemy squads and this feature is known as Assimilation. It adds a bit of strategy to the game. And is an especially neat feature for players that have empty slots in their squad. So in this guide check out how Assimilation works and how to join or invite enemies in CoD Warzone 2.
 
## What is Assimilation in CoD Warzone 2?
 

 
Assimilation is a feature in Warzone 2 that allows you and your enemies to join or invite other players during the match. As mentioned previously, it is a good feature if you have an empty slot in your squad. Or if you are bothered by toxic teammates then you can simply join your enemy’s squad. And the best part is, you can switch this mid-match so no need to wait for the next match to play with them.
 
Do remember this feature isn’t available in every single mode of the game. You can only use it in Unhinged and DMZ modes for:
 
- Duos: 2-player teams
 - Trios: 3-player teams
 - Quads: 4-player teams

 
## How to Join Enemy Squads in Warzone 2.0
 
You can join your enemies by using the ping wheel. But it requires you to be in their proximity, and can’t just join them from anywhere.
 
- Go to some area where you know your enemies are. While you could do this in the open, I suggest you take some cover in case they reject you, then they just get to shoot you on sight.
 - Open the Ping wheel.
 - Here, choose Request to Join Nearby Enemy Squad.
 - The enemy team will get your request.

 
If they accept you will join their squad.
 
### How to Invite Enemies to your Squad
 
In case you have a slot empty and wish to fill it. Then you can also invite the enemy instead of joining their squad. Again try going to a safe spot close to them.
 
- Open the Ping Wheel.
 - This time choose Invite Nearby Players to Join Your Squad.
 - The enemy will get your request.

 
After they accept you can see them in your team.
 
That covers this guide on what assimilation is in CoD Warzone 2 and how to join or invite enemies. In case you don’t want to join or invite any player you should simply revive your knocked-out teammate or buy them back. For more help on this game check out our CoD Warzone 2.0 section.
