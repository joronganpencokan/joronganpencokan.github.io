4. It's a great way to show support: If someone sends you a message expressing their feelings or sharing their experiences, and you want to let them know that you understand and support them, the 'like' button is a great way to do that. It shows that you're listening and that you care.

5. It's versatile: The 'like' feature is not just limited to text messages. You can 'like' messages on various social media platforms too.
