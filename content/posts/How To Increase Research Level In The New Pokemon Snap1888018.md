10 SUREFIRE ways to BOOST your Research Level in the EPIC New Pokemon Snap Game!

Attention all aspiring Pokemon photographers! The highly-anticipated game, New Pokemon Snap, has finally arrived, and it's time to put on your camera lens and capture those unforgettable moments of Pokemon in their natural habitats. However, with the new game comes a new set of challenges, and players must be able to boost their research level to unlock more areas and gather enough data to complete the Photodex. Here are ten surefire ways to boost your research level in the epic new Pokemon Snap game:

1. Explore Every Corner of the Island

One of the critical factors in boosting your research level is unlocking new areas of the Lental region island. Therefore, it's essential to take your sweet time exploring all the nooks and crannies of each level to reveal hidden paths and branching routes. Don't forget to toss an Illumina orb or two to reveal some intriguing surprises.

2. Examine the Camera Upgrades

As you progress through the game, you'll be able to enhance your camera's abilities with different upgrades. Before each session, take some time to fiddle with your camera's settings and see which lens or filter could help you capture a more high-quality photo.

3. Be Patient

Patience is a virtue, and it's no different in Pokemon Snap. While exploring each level, take your time and observe each Pokemon's behavior, as they might be showing off some unique poses or actions that could merit a higher score.

4. Utilize the Scan Function

One of the most underrated tools in the game is the scan function. Utilizing the scan function on Pokemon, plants, and other objects within the level helps reveal hidden interactions and can unlock further routes.

5. Use the Music to Your Advantage

Each level in the game has its unique soundtrack that corresponds to specific Pokemon behavior. Pay attention to the music as it may signify rare interactions or a Pokemon's mood, leading to a more successful shot.

6. Pay Attention to the Requests

Throughout each level, Professor Mirror may request you to capture a specific shot or behavior. Make sure to complete these requests as they can lead to significant increases in research level and valuable unlocks.

7. Rent Some UFOs

The Lental region hosts peculiar glowing UFOS that tend to interact with Pokemon in the area. Renting some UFOS and seeing how they react to certain Pokemon can lead to rare and high-scoring shots.

8. Be Mindful of the Pokemon's Direction

While it may be tempting to snap away at every Pokemon you see, remember that their direction is essential in scoring. Capture photos of Pokemon looking directly at the camera or in artistic angles to achieve a higher score.

9. Experiment with Fluffruits

Tossing some fluffruits at Pokemon can lead to unique interactions and behaviors. Experiment with different angles and heights to capture some one-of-a-kind shots.

10. Upgrade Your Research Level and Return to Previous Levels

As you progress through the game, don't forget to go back to previous levels with a higher research level. Pokemon may be more receptive to interactions that lead to higher-scoring shots or reveal new paths.

In conclusion, New Pokemon Snap is a game that requires patience, attention to detail, and a little bit of luck. By utilizing these ten surefire ways to boost your research level, players can unlock new areas and complete the photodex with ease. Happy snapping!

Pokemon snap is divided into 6 regions all further divided into more regions and courses. To advance further you will have to complete all courses and for that, you will have to unlock both day and night levels of the islands. The night level of islands can be unlocked by reaching research level 2 in the day level. To reach research level 2 you need to reach a target of expedition points. Let’s see how you can increase the research level in Pokemon Snap.
 
## How To Increase Research Level In Pokemon Snap?
 

Players get expedition points based on the photos they take of pokemons. This might be an oversimplification as your photo gets rated on multiple criterias all contributing to your expedition points meter. Size of the Pokemons, the activity they are doing if they are looking at the camera or not are some aspects based on which you’re photo is rated. The size of the Pokemon has the highest weightage in the rating so make sure you capture all those giants. All pokemons have 4 poses so try and capture all of them as you get extra points for extra poses. Make sure the background is good and the pokemon isn’t going out of the frame.
 
If the pokemon looks at the camera it gives you extra points. Remember that initially, pokemons will run away but with increasing expedition points and research level, they will get familiar with you. While you might not meet all criterias in the beginning just keep clicking as grinding through the game is the best way to get expedition points. As you reach higher research levels Pokemons will get familiar with you and won’t run away and might also look at the camera. Clicking new pokemon fetches you most expedition points so make sure you click all of them.
