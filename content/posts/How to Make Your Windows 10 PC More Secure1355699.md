In today's world, online security has become an essential part of our daily lives. With the increasing number of cyber threats, keeping your Windows 10 PC safe from hackers and malware has become more critical than ever. In this article, we'll provide you with five simple steps to supercharge your PC's security and provide you with peace of mind.

Step 1: Keep Windows 10 Up to Date

Microsoft regularly releases updates for Windows 10, including security patches, bug fixes, and new features. These updates are essential in addressing any known vulnerabilities and keeping your PC secure. To ensure your Windows 10 PC is up to date, go to Settings, click Update & Security, and then click Windows Update. From there, you can check for any available updates and install them.

Step 2: Install a Reliable Antivirus Program

Installing an antivirus program is another critical step to supercharging the security of your Windows 10 PC. A reliable antivirus program can detect and remove malware, spyware, and other malicious programs before they can do harm. There are many options available, both free and paid, with varying levels of features and protection. We recommend doing some research to find the best antivirus program for your needs.

Step 3: Enable Windows Defender Firewall

The Windows Defender Firewall is a built-in feature of Windows 10 that provides an additional layer of security for your PC. It helps prevent unauthorized access to your computer by monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic. To enable the firewall, go to Settings, click Update & Security, and then click Windows Security. From there, click Firewall & Network Protection, and then turn on the Windows Defender Firewall.

Step 4: Use Strong Passwords

One of the simplest yet most effective ways to improve your Windows 10 PC's security is by using strong passwords. Creating complex passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters can help prevent unauthorized access to your accounts. Additionally, avoid using the same password across multiple accounts, as a security breach in one account can compromise all of your accounts.

Step 5: Be Mindful of Phishing Scams

Phishing scams are a common tactic used by cybercriminals to gain access to your personal information, such as login credentials or financial details. These scams can take many forms, such as fake emails, websites, or text messages, and often appear legitimate. Be wary of unsolicited messages, and avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. If in doubt, contact the sender directly to verify the authenticity of the message.

In conclusion, by following these five simple steps, you can supercharge the security of your Windows 10 PC and reduce your risk of falling victim to cyber threats. Remember to keep your Windows 10 system up to date, install a reliable antivirus program, enable the Windows Defender Firewall, use strong passwords, and stay vigilant against phishing scams. Stay safe online!

In the past I haven’t been the biggest fan of Windows 10. In fact, some of my most popular articles have been me talking about how Windows 10 invades your privacy and why you shouldn’t upgrade to it. I upgraded to Windows 10, though (part of the job scope if you’re a techie, really), and I’m sure a lot of you have over time, too.
 
So once you’re here, you might want to know how to enhance your security and privacy even though you’re using Windows 10. I know I do. Here’s my tips.
 
## Disable Cortana
 

 
Before you go further into this guide, you’ll want to open Settings. Simply opening the Start Menu and clicking “Settings” will bring you to this screen from where you can navigate to whatever you might need.
 
First, we’ll direct you to disabling Cortana. While Cortana does offer a great set of features, especially in Microsoft Edge, Cortana can also be creepy and overbearing to some people. If you want to disable it, here’s how.
 
First, click Privacy. After you do that, select “Speech, inking & typing,” which will take you to this screen.
 
Now that you’re here, all you need to do is click “Stop getting to know me,” and you’re pretty much set.
 
## Disable Microsoft’s Data Collections
 
A large part of my original criticisms of Windows 10 is the data collections. I’m still uncertain about how much of them can actually be disabled, but from what I’ve heard, this configuration should put your Windows 10 installation about even with the one you ran on 7 or 8.
 
First, head to “General” in Privacy, and disable the options above like so. I have SmartScreen enabled, however, since there’s no real harm in it in terms of privacy.
 
Next, change your “Send your device data to Microsoft” to Basic as seen above. This can’t be fully disabled outside of Windows 10 Enterprise, but Basic data collection here is what you were sending to Microsoft anyways. Feedback can be set to whatever you like, too.
 
After this, go to Start and type Control Panel. After you open Control Panel, type Customer Experience. Click “Change Customer Experience Improvement Settings.” This is a hidden program in Windows 10 that you may have enabled if you didn’t disable it during setup. If you did, it’ll look like this.
 
## Disable Microsoft’s Targeted Advertising
 
Head to this webpage! This is pretty simple. All you need to do is unselect Personalized ads on both “in this browser” and “wherever I use my Microsoft account.” This will keep MS’ targeted advertising out of your life.
 
If you want to get rid of advertising in general, consider an adblocker.
 
## Use a Program for It!
 
Finally, you could always use a program to disable tracking across your entire Windows 10 Installation. Available as an open-source project on GitHub, DisableWinTracking does exactly as it implies – it disables most, if not all, of the tracking in Windows 10.
 
That aside, there’s not much else to talk about. You’re welcome to disable Microphone, Location and Camera in your settings if you’d like as well, but that disables those things for the programs you use, too, which might just be a pain.
 
Other guides may recommend disabling certain Windows Defender features, but I don’t recommend that. There’s a difference between ensuring your privacy and making yourself vulnerable to entities that are actually malicious.
 
In this modern age, there’s a real reason to be concerned about privacy. If this guide doesn’t do enough for you, you may not want to be running Windows 10 at all, but you will be sacrificing features as we move forward in technology.
