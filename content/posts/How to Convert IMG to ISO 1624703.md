Have you ever encountered a situation when you needed to create an ISO file from an image, but you were not sure how to do it properly? Look no further because with just one click, you can easily unlock the secret to making perfect ISOs from images!

An ISO file format is commonly used to create a digital copy of a physical disc or to store a collection of files as a single virtual disc. It is useful for sharing large files, preserving digital backups or for installing software on multiple computers, without the need for a physical disc.

Traditionally, creating ISO files was a cumbersome process involving a series of commands in the command prompt or using third-party software. However, with the latest version of Windows 10, you can easily create ISO files from images with just a single click.

Here's how to do it:

1. Ensure that your computer is running Windows 10.

2. Locate the image file that you want to create an ISO from.

3. Right-click the image file and select "Mount."

4. Once the image file is mounted, open File Explorer and navigate to "This PC."

5. Under "Devices and drives," you will see a virtual DVD drive with the image file that you mounted.

6. Right-click on the virtual DVD drive and select "Create a system image."

7. In the "Create a system image" window, select "On a hard disk" and choose the location where you want to save the ISO file.

8. Click "Next" and wait for the system image to be created.

9. Once the ISO file has been created, you can use it for backup purposes or to install software on multiple computers.

In just these simple steps, you can create ISO files from images with just one click, saving you time and effort. The process is straightforward, and you can also create ISOs from multiple images simultaneously.

In conclusion, creating ISO files from images is no longer a tedious process thanks to the latest feature in Windows 10. With just one click, you can create a perfect ISO file, and use it for various purposes, whether it's for backup, software installation, or sharing large files with others. So go ahead and try this useful feature today!

The latest and greatest by Microsoft, Windows 10, lets you mount these files without demanding the assistance of third-party programs.
