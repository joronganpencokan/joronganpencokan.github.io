# Unleash Your Inner Assassin: Learn How to Take Down Tommasi in Control's Most Intense Boss Fight Yet!

Control is a thrilling action-adventure game that immerses players in a world of supernatural powers and mysterious entities. One of the most challenging boss fights in Control is against Tommasi, an elusive and powerful enemy that can become invisible and teleport at will.

In this article, we'll share some tips and strategies to help you beat Tommasi and unleash your inner assassin!

## Understanding Tommasi's Abilities

Before we dive into the tips, it's essential to understand Tommasi's abilities. Tommasi can teleport around the area, become invisible, and shoot powerful energy blasts that can knock Jesse (the game's protagonist) off her feet.

The key to beating Tommasi is to stay mobile and avoid his attacks while unleashing powerful attacks of your own.

## Tip 1: Keep Moving and Stay Alert

Tommasi can attack from any direction, so it's crucial to keep moving constantly. Don't stand still, or you'll become an easy target for his energy blasts.

Keep an eye out for Tommasi's energy blasts and listen for his footsteps. When he's about to teleport, you'll hear a distinctive whooshing sound. Use that opportunity to dash away from his attack and get into a better position.

## Tip 2: Use Your Powers Wisely

Jesse's supernatural powers play a significant role in this fight. Use your Launch ability to throw objects at Tommasi and deal massive damage. You can also use Seize to take control of Tommasi's mind and turn him against his allies.

Make sure to use your powers strategically and make the most out of them in this intense battle.

## Tip 3: Take Cover and Use the Environment

Control's environments are highly interactive, and you can use that to your advantage in this fight. Take cover behind objects and use them as shields to avoid Tommasi's energy blasts.

You can also use the environment to your advantage by throwing objects at Tommasi's location. If you hit him, he'll become visible and vulnerable to your attacks, making it easier to take him down.

## Tip 4: Stay Calm and Patient

Finally, stay calm and patient. This is a challenging fight, and it may take several attempts to beat Tommasi. Stay focused and avoid getting frustrated. Take your time, learn his patterns, and adjust your approach to take him down.

Remember, you're Jesse Faden, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Control. You're powerful, you're resilient, and you can beat Tommasi!

## Conclusion

Beating Tommasi in Control is a daunting task, but with these tips and strategies, you can unleash your inner assassin and show him who's boss.

Stay mobile, use your supernatural powers wisely, take cover, and stay calm and patient. With these techniques, you'll be able to take down one of the most intense boss fights in all of Control. Good luck, Director!

During Mission Unknown Caller for the first time, you will face Tommasi, a kind of the first Boss in Control Game. Hiss corrupted Tommasi is hard to beat because of limited weapon choices in Control Game. He is always airborne and keeps moving, so shooting a moving target is not simple. If you are stuck at this point, where after reaching Director’s Office you have to activate a Control Point. Then you have to proceed through the Communication Dept, but Tommassi will not let you pass. Our Control Boss fight guide can help you to take this enemy down.
 
## How to defeat His-corrupted Tommasi
 
The best weapon to kill Tommasi is Pierce, but you won’t get it until you had passed on further levels. The best way to play Control and deal with the boss is playing defensive. When you see Tommasi there is an area in the middle of the room where you can crouch and sit. There will be weaker enemies around you can take them down easily. To defeat Tommasi wait for his attack, once pulls out the debris then use your power to throw objects on him.
 

 
This will stun him for a while and start shooting on the head. This process works the best and you can kill down Tomassi with it. Always stay in cover, and the best place I found is the circular area in the center of a huge hall. When Tomassi attacks it gets wasted due to the objects and the structure. So you are completely safe from it.
