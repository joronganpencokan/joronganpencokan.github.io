You Won't Believe How To Tell If Someone Blocked You On Facebook In 2023!

In the age of social media, it's hard to imagine a world without Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Facebook has become one of the most popular social networking sites with approximately 2.8 billion monthly active users. However, what if you find out that someone has blocked you on Facebook? This can be a big shock for anyone, but thankfully, there are ways to tell if someone has blocked you on Facebook in 2023!

1. Check For Their Profile

The first step to figuring out if someone has blocked you on Facebook is to search for their profile. If you try to search for their profile and nothing comes up, it's likely they have blocked you. However, this could also mean that they have deactivated their account or have changed their privacy settings. So, before jumping to conclusions, try to find their profile using different methods, such as looking through friends' profiles or searching for their name in Facebook groups.

2. Check The Messenger

If you're still unsure whether someone has blocked you on Facebook, try checking the messenger. If you were previously in a conversation with them, you should be able to see the conversation history. However, if they have blocked you, you will not be able to see any of your previous conversations with them. This is a clear sign that they have blocked you on Facebook.

3. Check Your Mutual Friends

Another way to tell if someone has blocked you on Facebook is to check your mutual friends. If you have mutual friends with the person, try looking through their profiles to see if you can find any information. If you can no longer see their posts or comments on mutual friends' posts, this could be another sign that they have blocked you.

4. Ask A Friend

If you're still unsure whether someone has blocked you on Facebook, try asking a friend who is also friends with them. Ask your friend to look at the person's profile and see if they can see any posts or comments by you. If they can't, then it's highly likely that you have been blocked.

In conclusion, you can tell if someone has blocked you on Facebook by following these steps. However, it's important to remember that just because you can't find their profile, it doesn't necessarily mean they have blocked you. They could have just deactivated their account, changed their privacy settings, or simply decided to unfriend you. So, before jumping to conclusions, make sure to check all possible avenues.

To tell whether someone blocked you on Facebook or deactivated their account, try to search for them on your Friends’ list. If they have deactivated their account, their profile is still there. If they deleted their account, you won’t find their profile. It’s one of the many ways to check it.
 
Was there some misunderstanding and now you see that the number of friends has gone down on your Facebook account? 
 
Well, it happens a lot of times when our real-life interactions/behavior reflect on social media platforms. And please note that it may not always be the case of getting blocked but sometimes the user may delete or deactivate their Facebook account to get rid of the complications and irritation of social networks.
 
In this article, we mention a few ways which can be used to tell if someone blocked you on Facebook or deactivated the account.  So without further ado, let’s jump right into the tutorial.

## How To Tell If Someone Blocked You On Facebook Or Deactivated Their Account?
 
### Check Recent Conversation
 
Open the conversation that you might have had earlier with that person on Facebook chat. If their profile picture is visible to you but you cannot go to their profile by clicking on their profile pic then it is a sign that you are blocked by them. 
 
Moreover, you won’t be able to send messages to that person as well.
 
To confirm, you can open this conversation in the messenger. If you can see their pic but the message box is disabled then it means that you have been blocked.
 
However, if the person has not blocked you but left Facebook by deactivating their account then obviously you cannot message or visit their profile similar to blocking. 
 
But in the case of deactivation, you will not see their profile pic in the conversation as well. You may also see Facebook user (read here about what Facebook user means).
 
However, keep in mind that only seeing a blank profile image does not mean the person got their profile deactivated; read our post about the blank Facebook profile to learn about all possible reasons for that.
 
This is the main difference between someone blocking you or deactivating their account.
 
### Do Facebook Search
 
Try searching the person in question using the FB search bar at the top. 
 
Either you won’t find the person in search suggestions or even if you find them you won’t be able to visit their profile. If you get the following message “Sorry, this content isn’t available right now“, you have been blocked or the person might have deactivated their account.
 
Also, the person may have simply set their privacy settings so that their profile became unsearchable.
 
### Check Friend List Of A Mutual Friend
 
- Visit the profile of a mutual friend. Open the friend list from their profile. If you are not able to find the suspected person in their friend list, it means that you have been blocked, most likely.

 
Note: Even if the friend has a hidden Friend list still you can access your mutual friends on Facebook.
 
### Ask A Friend
 
You may also ask a friend to check if they can see the suspected person’s profile. 
 
If they are able to view the profile then surely you are on that person’s Block list on Facebook. It may be possible that the person has also blocked your friend as well. To be sure you can ask some other person to check the profile of that person.
 
If another person is also not able to access the profile of that user then most probably the account is not active anymore.
 
### Bonus Tip: Determine Whether You Are Blocked On Facebook Or Account Is Deactivated
 
After checking the above steps follow this tip to tell if someone blocked you or the user has deleted/deactivated the Facebook account.
 
Open Facebook and go to Settings. Under Settings select Blocking. Enter the name of the person under Block users whom you suspect has blocked you and press Enter or click Block.
 
If you find that person’s name on searching then you are blocked. On the other hand, if you cannot find that user in the list after searching then it is highly likely that the user has deactivated their Facebook account and not blocked you.

It might also happen that someone just wants to ignore you on the Messenger and does not want to unfriend or block you from Facebook. You can follow the steps below to check if someone is ignoring you on the messenger or not.
 
1. Open the Messenger app on your phone. Now search for your friend who you think has blocked you on messenger.
 
2. Once you find the friend, tap on that friend’s name to see your chatting history. Now try to send them a message by typing a message in the text box at the bottom of the screen and then tap on Send.
 
3. If the message goes through and you see a check inside a circle icon. Then it means the person has not blocked you from Facebook and messenger. When they read your message the check icon will be changed with their profile icon as shown here.
 
4. However, if the person has blocked you only on the messenger, then your message will go through but the other person won’t receive it. This means that either they have blocked you on the messenger or they don’t have an active internet connection.
 
To confirm that your friend has not received the message you can look at the check under the circle icon. If the circle is filled with color then it means that the message is received. But, if the check under the circle icon is empty then it means that your friend has not received the message yet.
 
If you can see that the person is active now on the messenger but still the message is not received, then they have definitely blocked you on the messenger.
 
5. On opening the chat conversation with your friend if you see the message “You can’t reply to this conversation“. Then it means that either you have been completely blocked from Facebook by your friend or they have deactivated the account.
 
You can confirm this by following the steps shown in the previous method.
