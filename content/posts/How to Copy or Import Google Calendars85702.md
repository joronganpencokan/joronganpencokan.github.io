##   How to Copy Google Calendar Events  
 

With Google Calendar, you can maintain multiple calendars at once through a single Google account. It's easy to copy Google Calendar events from one calendar to another, and you can even merge them all into one unified schedule. Copying all events from one Google Calendar into another requires you to export the calendar first. Then you can import the calendar file into a separate calendar.

 
- Log in to Google Calendar with your Google account. Under the My Calendars section on the left side of the page, select the three vertical dots next to the calendar you want to copy and choose Settings and sharing.
 - Select the Export calendar button to download a ZIP file of the calendar.
 - Right-click the ZIP file you just downloaded and choose the Extract option to open the folder, then move the ICS file inside to somewhere you can easily find it.
 - Go back to Google Calendar, select the gear icon in the top-right corner, and choose Settings from the drop-down menu.
 - Select Import & export on the left side.
 - Choose Select file from your computer to open the ICS file from step 3.
 - Select Add to calendar and choose which calendar the events should be copied to.
 - Select Import to copy all of the saved calendar events to the designated Google calendar.

 
##   How to Copy, Move, or Duplicate Google Calendar Events  
 

Instead of copying a whole calendar full of events, you can move individual events between your calendars as well as make copies of specific events.

 

Log in to Google Calendar with your Google account. Under the My Calendars section on the left side of the page, select the three vertical dots next to the calendar you want to copy and choose Settings and sharing.

 

Select the Export calendar button to download a ZIP file of the calendar.

 

Right-click the ZIP file you just downloaded and choose the Extract option to open the folder, then move the ICS file inside to somewhere you can easily find it.

 

Go back to Google Calendar, select the gear icon in the top-right corner, and choose Settings from the drop-down menu.

 

Select Import & export on the left side.

 

Choose Select file from your computer to open the ICS file from step 3.

 

Select Add to calendar and choose which calendar the events should be copied to.

 

Select Import to copy all of the saved calendar events to the designated Google calendar.

 
To delete the original calendar so that you don't have duplicate events spread across multiple calendars, select Delete under Remove calendar at the bottom of the Settings and sharing page.
 
- Select an event that you'd like to move or copy, and then select the pencil icon that pops up to edit it.
 - Select More Actions and then choose Duplicate or Copy to from the drop-down menu.
 - Select Save to confirm the changes.

 
##   Tips for Copying, Merging and Duplicating Google Calendar Events  
 

Copying just one event to a different calendar might be useful if you want to share the details of an event with a group of friends. Sharing events this way avoids showing all of your events on the shared calendar.

 

Select an event that you'd like to move or copy, and then select the pencil icon that pops up to edit it.

 

Select More Actions and then choose Duplicate or Copy to from the drop-down menu.

 

Select Save to confirm the changes.

 

If you want to merge a whole calendar with another one, you are better off copying the entire calendar of events into a new or existing calendar rather than moving every single calendar event one by one.

 

Duplicating an event can be helpful if you want to make a similar event without having to create all of the details from scratch. Copying an event is also useful if you wish to the same or similar events in multiple calendars.
