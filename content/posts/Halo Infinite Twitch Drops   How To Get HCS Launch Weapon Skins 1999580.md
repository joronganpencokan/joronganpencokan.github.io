## When and What to Watch?

If you're hoping to get your hands on exclusive HCS launch weapon skins, you'll need to watch official HCS streams on Twitch. These streams can vary in length and time, so it's best to check the HCS esports website or their official Twitter page for updates on which streams are eligible for Twitch Drops.

Once you've found an eligible stream, make sure to watch it for the required amount of time to receive the reward. The amount of time required can vary, so again, it's best to check the HCS esports website or Twitter page for updates.

## How to Claim Rewards?

Once you've watched the required amount of an eligible HCS stream, your reward will be added to your account automatically. Make sure to log in to the game you want the reward for, and you should see the item in your inventory.
