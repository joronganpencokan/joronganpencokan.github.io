# Unleash Your Inner Organizational Genius with This Ultimate Guide to Creating a Customized Calendar in Excel!

As we go through our busy lives, it's easy to lose track of important appointments, meetings, and deadlines. That's where calendars come in handy. They help us keep track of our schedule and remind us of upcoming events.

However, not all calendars are created equal. If you're someone who needs a little extra organization in their life, you might want to consider creating a customized calendar in Excel. Excel is an extremely versatile program that can help you create a personalized calendar that meets all your needs. In this article, we'll guide you through the process of creating a customized calendar in Excel.

## Step 1: Open Excel and Set Up Your Spreadsheet

The first thing you need to do is open Excel and set up your spreadsheet. This will be the foundation of your calendar. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open Excel.
2. Click on "File," then "New."
3. Choose "Blank Workbook."
4. Click "OK."

You should now have a blank spreadsheet in front of you.

## Step 2: Choose Your Calendar Format

There are many different types of calendars you can create in Excel, so it's important to choose the format that works best for you. You might want to consider factors such as:

- The purpose of the calendar (e.g. personal, work, family, etc.)
- The level of detail you need (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
- The amount of space you have available.

Once you've decided on the type of calendar you want to create, you can begin formatting your spreadsheet accordingly.

## Step 3: Format Your Spreadsheet

Formatting your spreadsheet is an important part of creating a customized calendar in Excel. Here are some steps you can follow to get started:

1. Choose the font you want to use for your calendar. This should be a clear, easy-to-read font that you can use consistently throughout the spreadsheet.
2. Decide on the color scheme you want to use. You might want to use different colors to differentiate between different types of events (e.g. work, personal, family, etc.).
3. Set up the cells in your spreadsheet. This will depend on the type of calendar you want to create. For example, if you're creating a monthly calendar, you might want to have one row for each week of the month, with the days of the week listed horizontally across the top.

## Step 4: Add Your Events

Now that you've set up your calendar, it's time to start adding your events. Here's how you can do it:

1. Choose the cell where you want to add an event.
2. Type in the event name.
3. Set the date and time of the event.
4. Add any additional details you want to include (e.g. location, notes, etc.).
5. Continue adding events until your calendar is complete.

## Step 5: Customize Your Calendar

One of the great things about creating a customized calendar in Excel is that you can make it as simple or as complex as you want. Here are some ways you can customize your calendar to make it more useful:

- Create different tabs for different types of events (e.g. personal, work).
- Use conditional formatting to highlight events that are approaching or past due.
- Add formulas that automatically calculate the duration of events or the time between events.
- Use charts and graphs to visualize your schedule.

## Step 6: Save and Print Your Calendar

Once you've created your customized calendar in Excel, it's important to save it so you can access it whenever you need it. Here's how to do it:

1. Click "File," then "Save As."
2. Choose a location to save your spreadsheet.
3. Give your spreadsheet a name that will make it easy to find.
4. Select "Excel Workbook (*.xlsx)" as the file type.
5. Click "Save."

Now you can print your calendar and start using it!

This article explains four different ways on how to make a calendar in Excel. Instructions apply to Excel 2019, Excel 2016, Excel 2013, Excel 2010, Excel for Mac, Excel for Android, and Excel Online.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Easiest way is to use the numerous pre-made calendar templates: Go to File > New > "calendar" in search field > select calendar > Create.Alternatively, use Excel to make a custom calendar.

 
##   How to Make a Pre-Made Calendar in Excel  
 

You can craft your own calendar in Excel from scratch, but the easiest way to create a calendar is using a pre-made calendar template. Templates are useful because you can edit each day to include special events, and then print each month whenever you like.

 
- Select File > New.
 - In the search field, type calendar and select the magnifying glass to initiate the search.
 - Select the calendar style that suites your needs. This example uses the Any year calendar. Once you've selected your calendar, select Create.
 - Each calendar template has unique features. The Any year calendar template in particular lets you type in a new year or starting day of the week to automatically customize the calendar.

 
##   How to Make a Custom Monthly Calendar in Excel  
 

If you don't like the limitations of a calendar template, you can create your own calendar from scratch in Excel.

 

Select File > New.

 

In the search field, type calendar and select the magnifying glass to initiate the search.

 

Select the calendar style that suites your needs. This example uses the Any year calendar. Once you've selected your calendar, select Create.

 

Each calendar template has unique features. The Any year calendar template in particular lets you type in a new year or starting day of the week to automatically customize the calendar.

 
- Open Excel and type the days of the week in the first row of the spreadsheet. This row will form the foundation of your calendar.
 - Seven months of the year have 31 days, so the first stage of this process is to create the months for your calendar that hold 31 days. This will be a grid of seven columns and five rows.
 - To start, select all seven columns, and adjust the first column width to the size you'd like your calendar days to be. All seven columns will adjust to the same.
 - Next, adjust the row heights by selecting the five rows under your weekday row. Adjust the height of the first column.
 - To adjust the height of several rows at the same time, simply highlight the rows you'd like to adjust before changing the height.
 - Next, you need to align the day numbers to the upper-right of each daily box. Highlight every cell across all seven columns and five rows. Right click on one of the cells and select Format Cells. Under the Text alignment section, set Horizontal to Right (Indent), and set Vertical to Top.
 - Now that the cell alignments are ready, it's time to number the days. You'll need to know which day is the first day of January for the current year, so Google "January" followed by the year you're making the calendar for. Find a calendar example for January. For 2020, for example, the first day of the month starts on a Wednesday.
 - For 2020, starting on Wednesday, number the dates in sequential order until you get to 31.
 - Now that you have January finished, it's time to name and create the rest of the months. Copy the January sheet to create the February sheet.
 - Right-click the sheet name and select Rename. Name it January. Once again, right-click the sheet and select Move or Copy. Select Create a copy. Under Before sheet, select (move to end). Select OK to create the new sheet.
 - Rename this sheet. Right click the sheet, select Rename, and type February.
 - Repeat the above process for the remaining 10 months.
 - Now it's time to adjust the date numbers for each month after the template month of January. Starting with February, stagger the starting date of the month to whichever day of the week follows the last day of the January. Do the same for the rest of the calendar year.
 - Remember to remove non-existent dates from the months that are not 31 days long. Those include: February (28 days—29 days in a leap year), April, June, September, and November (30 days).
 - As the last step, you can label each month by adding a row at the top of each sheet. Insert a top row by right-clicking the top row and selecting Insert. Select all seven cells above the days of the week, select the Home menu, and then select Merge & Center from the ribbon. Type the month name into the single cell, and reformat the font size to 16. Repeat the process for the rest of the calendar year.

 

Once you're finished numbering months, you will have an accurate calendar in Excel for the full year.

 

Open Excel and type the days of the week in the first row of the spreadsheet. This row will form the foundation of your calendar.

 

Seven months of the year have 31 days, so the first stage of this process is to create the months for your calendar that hold 31 days. This will be a grid of seven columns and five rows.

 

To start, select all seven columns, and adjust the first column width to the size you'd like your calendar days to be. All seven columns will adjust to the same.

 

Next, adjust the row heights by selecting the five rows under your weekday row. Adjust the height of the first column.

 
To adjust the height of several rows at the same time, simply highlight the rows you'd like to adjust before changing the height.
 

Next, you need to align the day numbers to the upper-right of each daily box. Highlight every cell across all seven columns and five rows. Right click on one of the cells and select Format Cells. Under the Text alignment section, set Horizontal to Right (Indent), and set Vertical to Top.

 

Now that the cell alignments are ready, it's time to number the days. You'll need to know which day is the first day of January for the current year, so Google "January" followed by the year you're making the calendar for. Find a calendar example for January. For 2020, for example, the first day of the month starts on a Wednesday.

 

For 2020, starting on Wednesday, number the dates in sequential order until you get to 31.

 

Now that you have January finished, it's time to name and create the rest of the months. Copy the January sheet to create the February sheet.

 

Right-click the sheet name and select Rename. Name it January. Once again, right-click the sheet and select Move or Copy. Select Create a copy. Under Before sheet, select (move to end). Select OK to create the new sheet.

 

Rename this sheet. Right click the sheet, select Rename, and type February.

 

Repeat the above process for the remaining 10 months.

 

Now it's time to adjust the date numbers for each month after the template month of January. Starting with February, stagger the starting date of the month to whichever day of the week follows the last day of the January. Do the same for the rest of the calendar year.

 
Remember to remove non-existent dates from the months that are not 31 days long. Those include: February (28 days—29 days in a leap year), April, June, September, and November (30 days).
 

As the last step, you can label each month by adding a row at the top of each sheet. Insert a top row by right-clicking the top row and selecting Insert. Select all seven cells above the days of the week, select the Home menu, and then select Merge & Center from the ribbon. Type the month name into the single cell, and reformat the font size to 16. Repeat the process for the rest of the calendar year.

 

You can print any month by selecting all of the calendar cells and selecting File > Print. Change orientation to Landscape. Select Page Setup, select the Sheet tab, and then enable Gridlines under the Print section.

 

Select OK and then Print to send your monthly calendar sheet to the printer.

 
##   How to Make a Custom Weekly Calendar in Excel  
 

Another great way to stay organized is to create a weekly calendar with hour-by-hour blocks. You can create full a 24-hour calendar or limit it to a typical work schedule.

 
- Open a blank Excel sheet and create the header row. Leaving the first column blank, add the hour when you typically start your day to the first row. Work your way across the header row adding hour until your day is complete. Bold the whole row when you're done.
 - Leaving the first row blank, type out the days of the week in the first column. Bold the whole column when you're done.
 - Highlight all rows that include the days of the week. Once all are highlighted, resize one row to a size that will allow you to write in your daily/hourly agenda.
 - Highlight all columns that include the hours of each day. Once all are highlighted, resize one column to a size that will allow you to write in your daily/hourly agenda.
 - To print your new daily agenda, highlight all cells of the agenda. Select File > Print. Change the orientation to Landscape. Select Page Setup, select the Sheet tab, and then enable Gridlines under the Print section. Change Scaling to Fit All Columns on One Page. This will fit the daily agenda to one page. If your printer can support it, change the page size to Tabloid (11" x 17").
