Introduction

As the saying goes, “music is the universal language of mankind," and playing music has been an essential part of human culture since ancient times. As technology continues to evolve, it has become increasingly easier to create music without expensive studio equipment or even real instruments.

One of the most popular tools for music creation is Garageband, a digital audio workstation developed by Apple. While its high level of versatility and user-friendliness have made it an attractive choice for both beginners and professionals, it can undoubtedly be overwhelming for those new to music production. That's where this template comes in! With the following Garageband template, you can unleash your inner musician and create perfect songs every time!

The Template

The first step towards creating perfect songs every time is to begin with a solid foundation - this means starting with a solid template. The following steps outline how you can access this free template and begin to create your perfect song!

Step 1: Open Garageband

Find Garageband in your application folder and open it.

Step 2: Choose New Project

Once in Garageband, select the “New Project” button. You will be asked to choose between Software Instrument and Audio Tracks. Select “Software Instrument” as this is the template type we will be using.

Step 3: Choose the Template

Now that you have selected the “Software Instrument” option, select “Empty Project,” then scroll down to where it says “Alternative Singer/Songwriter.” This is the template we will be using for our perfect song!

Step 4: Begin Creating!

Now that you have selected the “Alternative Singer/Songwriter” template, you can begin creating your perfect song. Begin by adding your own lyrics and melodies to the existing instruments, or if you’re feeling adventurous, add your own sounds, instruments, and effects.

Using pre-made templates is an excellent choice - especially for beginners. Starting from scratch can be daunting and can even cause you to abandon a project altogether. The alternative singer/songwriter template provides a solid foundation for creating songs in the alternative or indie genre, giving you a starting point that you can adjust and customize according to your musical needs and preferences.

At the first look at this title, you may be wondering why anyone would want to make a song template in GarageBand. 
 
A song template can help you to save time and make your song writing and recording much simpler. A song template can help you to manage your preferences across multiple songs. No more resetting your count for each track. Instead of having to set your preferences for each track, you can simply get down to business and create your song. Also, having a song template will prevent GarageBand from automatically opening your last song when you double click on the icon, which will reduce the load time when you are ready to create a new track.
 
Now, let’s get you set up with your first template.

1. Create your GarageBand song the way that you want it to be. Don’t get too invested, unless you plan to re-use elements of the melody again. Play with your settings, your default instruments and anything else that you prefer that is not standard. Once you have your file just the way that you want it, save it with the name “Template”.
 

 
2. Use finder to locate your template track. You can do that with a simple search in the magnifying glass in the upper right hand corner. Just click on it, and then begin typing to search. Once you find your song, select it. That way, you will be able to open your template style file, and begin to build on the foundation of a song that you have already created.
 
3. Now you can double click on the file to open it. All of your preferences are ready to go, and you can begin the creation of your song. Alternatively, open GarageBand, and simply choose Open an Existing File, then navigate to your track and open it as you would any other saved file.
 
4. Make one change to your song. Not a big one. Then click on File and Save As. Rename your track with whatever the title of the song will be. Be default, the title will be Template, at this point, so be sure to change the name before randomly clicking on the Save button. If you do accidentally click on the button, be sure to click on Edit then Undo and re-save your template file. You can then click on Edit and Redo, and go ahead and re-save your changes under a different name.
 
There you have it. This is not exactly a template, it is as we mentioned in the title, it is a sort of template. It allows you to not waste your composition time on setting up the same details again and again. As long as you are careful not to save over it, you will have nothing to worry about. If however, you know that you are the kind of person who will save without thinking, you should save more than one version of the template. Save a Template and a Template2, just be sure not to use Template2 unless you mess up the first version.
