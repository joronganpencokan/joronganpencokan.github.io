# Unlock the Secret Method to Viewing Gmail Messages in a Whole New Light - You Won't Believe How Easy It Is!

If you're like most people, you probably use Gmail for your email needs. And why not? Gmail is one of the most popular email clients out there, with more than 1.5 billion active users. It's easy to use, it's free, and it's accessible from pretty much anywhere.

But did you know that there's a secret method to viewing your Gmail messages in a whole new light? You won't believe how easy it is to unlock this hidden feature, and once you do, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it.

So what is this secret method? It's called "Labels," and it allows you to organize your Gmail messages in a way that makes them much easier to manage.

Here's how it works:

Step 1: Open Gmail and find a message you want to label. You can do this by scrolling through your inbox or by using the search bar at the top of the screen.

Step 2: Once you've found the message, hover your mouse over it. You'll see a little checkbox appear on the left-hand side of the message. Click on this checkbox to select the message.

Step 3: Once you've selected the message, look for the "Labels" button at the top of the screen. It should be next to the "More" button. Click on this button.

Step 4: A list of labels will appear. These are pre-defined labels that Gmail provides, such as "Important," "Starred," and "Sent." You can also create your own labels by clicking on the "Create new label" button.

Step 5: Choose the label you want to apply to the message. You can select more than one label if you want.

Step 6: Click "Apply" to apply the label(s) to the message.

That's it! You've now labeled your message, and it will appear in the appropriate label's section in your inbox. You can access your labeled messages by clicking on the appropriate label in the left-hand panel.

So why is this such a big deal? Well, for one thing, it allows you to organize your messages in a way that makes sense to you. You can use labels to separate important emails from less important ones, categorize emails by subject matter, or even flag emails that require action.

Labels also make it much easier to find specific messages when you need them. Instead of scrolling through your entire inbox looking for that one email you need, you can simply click on the appropriate label and find it in seconds.

And if you're worried about clutter, don't be. Labels won't clutter up your inbox, because they don't actually move your messages anywhere. Instead, they simply apply a tag to your messages that allows you to view them in a different section of your inbox.

So if you haven't already started using labels in Gmail, give it a try. You won't believe how easy it is to unlock this hidden feature, and once you do, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it.

To open a Gmail message in a separate browser window, hold down the Shift key while selecting the message. You can arrange the windows and view them simultaneously.

 

If you're using Conversation View, you'll see the entire conversation in the new window. If you only want to see one message and not an entire conversation, use the instructions below for disabling Conversation View or using Print View.

 

You can open as many messages in new windows or tabs as your browser allows, and you can continue to read the emails even after you delete them from or archive them in your inbox.

 
##   Disable Conversation View  
 

To open individual messages in separate windows instead of conversations, disable Conversation View. Here's how:

 
- In the upper-right corner of Gmail, select the Settings gear icon.
 - From the dropdown menu, choose See all settings.
 - In the General tab, scroll down to the Conversation View section and select Conversation view off.
 - At the bottom of the screen, select Save Changes.

 
##   Use Print View to Open Individual Emails from Conversations  
 

If you want to view individual messages without disabling Conversation View, you can use Print View to open individual emails in separate browser windows or tabs.

 

In the upper-right corner of Gmail, select the Settings gear icon.

 

From the dropdown menu, choose See all settings.

 

In the General tab, scroll down to the Conversation View section and select Conversation view off.
