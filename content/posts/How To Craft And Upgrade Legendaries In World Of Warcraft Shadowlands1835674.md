# Unlock the Secrets of Legendary Crafting and Upgrading in WoW Shadowlands - Become an Epic Champion Today!

Are you tired of falling behind your friends and other players in World of Warcraft Shadowlands? Do you want to become a legendary champion in the game? Look no further as we reveal the secrets of legendary crafting and upgrading in WoW Shadowlands.

Firstly, what is legendary crafting? Legendary crafting allows players to create powerful pieces of gear that have unique effects and bonuses. These pieces of gear are called legendary items and can be customized to suit your playstyle and class. The process takes time, effort, and resources, but the end result is worth it.

To start crafting a legendary item, you need to complete a series of quests and obtain a base item. This base item can be obtained through various means such as raiding, dungeons, or crafting. Once you have the base item, you need to gather resources such as Soul Ash, which is obtained by completing weekly quests and clearing Torghast, Tower of the Damned. You also need to acquire Memory of the Runecarver, which unlocks the legendary recipe for your chosen piece of gear.

Once you have the resources and recipe, you can craft your legendary item through the Runecarver in Torghast. This process requires you to sacrifice the base item, Soul Ash, and the Memory of the Runecarver. The end result is a powerful piece of gear tailored to your playstyle.

However, the process doesn't end there. Legendary items can also be upgraded to increase their power and effectiveness. To upgrade your legendary item, you need to gather Soul Ash and complete a questline that unlocks higher levels of the item. Each level requires an increasing amount of Soul Ash and higher-ranked Memory of the Runecarver recipes. The end result is a legendary item with increased power and additional effects.

In conclusion, legendary crafting and upgrading are complex and time-consuming processes, but the rewards are worth it. As a legendary champion, you'll be ahead of the competition and able to take on any challenge the game throws at you. So take the first step and start your legendary crafting journey today. Happy hunting!

Legendary Powers is a new concept in World of Warcraft franchise introduced with the release of Shadowlands. These Legendary Powers allow you to craft Legendary Armor, and as you would know legendary items have great stats. There is a specific process to craft Legendaries and upgrade them in World of Warcraft Shadowlands, and in this guide, we will be walking you through that.
 
## World of Warcraft Shadowlands: How to Craft Legendaries
 
You can craft Legendaries in WoW Shadowlands through Runecarver. It is a multi-step process where you have to first find the Runecarver and then you need to collect Soul Ash & Final Pieces. Here’s how you can do all of that.
 
### Find The Runecarver
 
You will find the Runecarver in the Antechamber of Torghast, the tower. It is a part of the Deep Within Quest, the first quest in the game dedicated to crafting Legendaries. It is the only thing that lets you craft Legendary Armor in World of Warcraft Shadowlands. Once you enter the Antechamber of Torghast tower, take a right to find a portal. Next, go through the portal to get to the Runecarver’s Oubliette where you will find the Runecarver itself. This brings us to the second part of the quest for crafting Legendaries.
 
### Collect Soul Ash
 
The next part of the quest is to gather 1,250 Soul Ash. You can collect it from the Ashes of the Tower as it is dropped by the enemies only in the Torghast region. So all you need to do is clear as many enemies possible in the Torghast and stock up on Soul Ash.
 
### Get The Final Pieces
 
The last part of the quest is the Final Pieces that requires you to collect the most important component to craft Legendaries in WoW Shadowlands, and also the most difficult ones to get. You need to have a Runecarver Memory, an Armor Rune Vessel suitable to the class the Armor is for, and 2 Missives.
 
You can get the Runecarver Memory while completing the Reawakening optional quest. The Armor Rune Vessels are found in every armor slot available. Collecting the two Missives can be challenging.
There are different types of Missives that you can collect by exploring the world of Shadowlands. However, they are very rare, and finding them can be tough. Once you are done with Missives, you will also need Legendary Power, which again can be found while exploring.
 
Once you have all these items, head back to the Runecarver, and easily craft Legendary Armor in World of Warcraft Shadowlands. However, only crafting is not enough. It is obvious that you would want to craft even lower level Legendary items as soon as they are available. Hence, it is essential to upgrade the Legendaries once you have crafted them.
 

 
## World of Warcraft Shadowlands: How to Upgrade Legendaries
 
You can upgrade Legendaries in WoW Shadowlands by collecting a base crafting item, a Rune Vessel, and the proper amount of Soul Ash. Upgrading Legendaries will also require gold materials. You can upgrade the Legendaries till Tier level 4. Here are the upgrade ranks and their levels.
 
- Rank 1: iLevel 190
 - Rank 2: iLevel 210
 - Rank 3: iLevel 225
 - Rank 4: iLevel 234

 
When you have enough items, head to Runecarver, place all the items in the empty slot, and click on upgrade. If you would have placed all the required items in the slot, Runecarver will upgrade the Legendaries for you.
