One of the crucial skills you must possess to succeed in the game is the ability to mark enemies like the Dark Knight himself. In this article, we will teach you the basics of enemy marking, just like Batman would.

## What is Enemy Marking?

Enemy marking is a gameplay feature that allows you to tag enemies in Gotham Knights, making them visible through walls and other obstructions. This feature enables you to plan your attacks, assess potential threats, and keep tabs on your enemies' movements. It also helps you to coordinate with your team and take down targets more efficiently and effectively.

## How to Mark Enemies in Gotham Knights?

To mark enemies in Gotham Knights, you must use your detective vision, just like Batman. To access your detective vision, press the designated button or key (depending on your gaming platform) and locate your enemies. When you hover over them, you will see a prompt to mark them with a tag.

Once you have marked an enemy, he or she will remain visible on your screen, even if they are not in your immediate line of sight. This allows you to track their movements and plan your next move accordingly. You can mark multiple enemies at once, and your tags will remain active until you reach a new area or complete your mission.

## Why is Enemy Marking Important?

Enemy marking is a vital skill in Gotham Knights, as it enables you to stay one step ahead of your enemies. It allows you to gain a strategic advantage in combat, avoid unnecessary confrontations, and eliminate potential threats. It also helps you to save time by streamlining your attacks and avoiding unnecessary detours.

Enemy marking is especially helpful when you are playing with a team, as it enables you to coordinate and communicate effectively. You can assign targets to your teammates, share intel on enemy movements, and execute your attacks together.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, mastering enemy marking is crucial to your success in Gotham Knights. It helps you become a better detective, strategist, and team player. By using your detective vision to tag enemies, you can stay ahead of the game and achieve your objectives more efficiently. So, unleash your inner detective, channel your inner Batman, and mark those enemies like a pro!
