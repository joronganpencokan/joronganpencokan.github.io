# Shhh...Unlock The Secret Trick To Making Private Calls From Your Phone Without Anyone Knowing!

In today's world, we rely heavily on our smartphones to communicate with others. We use them to send texts, emails, and make phone calls. However, sometimes we may want to have a private conversation without anyone knowing. This could be due to various reasons such as discussing confidential information or just wanting to avoid eavesdroppers. Whatever the reason may be, there is a secret trick that can help you make private calls from your phone without anyone knowing.

First of all, it is important to understand that there are different ways to make private calls. Some people may prefer to use apps such as Signal or WhatsApp that offer end-to-end encryption. However, these apps require both parties to have the app installed and signed in to use them. If you need to have a private conversation with someone who does not have the app, you will need to use a different method.

The secret trick to making private calls from your phone without anyone knowing is surprisingly simple. All you need to do is add "#31#" before the phone number you want to call. For example, if you want to call the number 123-456-7890, you will type "#31#1234567890" instead. By doing so, you are hiding your caller ID, which means that the person you are calling will not be able to see your phone number on their display.

This trick is supported by most mobile carriers and works on both iPhones and Android phones. However, there are some restrictions to this trick. For instance, it may not work for emergency calls or toll-free numbers. Also, if the person you are calling has caller ID blocking enabled on their phone, they may not be able to receive your call.

Another benefit of using this trick is that you can also block your caller ID permanently from your device's settings. This means that you do not have to add "#31#" before every call you make. Instead, your phone number will always be hidden from the person you are calling. However, keep in mind that this may not be an ideal option if you want to receive calls from people who are not in your contact list.

In conclusion, making private calls from your phone without anyone knowing is easy and can be done with a simple trick. By adding "#31#" before the phone number you want to call, you can hide your caller ID and keep your conversations private. However, remember that this trick may have some limitations and should be used responsibly.

Many of us hesitate to share our phone number – a valuable piece of our identity – because it’s more than a set of digits. In some cases, they let you log in to your bank accounts, control the locks and devices in a smart home, and act as doorkeepers to scores of websites and apps. What’s more, cyber-criminals have advanced resources at their disposal to take over someone’s mobile account.
 
In this post, we look at three ways to make private calls without revealing your number. Let’s begin with taking a look at blocking your number from displaying.
 
## 1. Use a Blocking Code or Withhold Your Number Before Dialing
 
For calls that don’t need a permanent solution, you can use a temporary blocking code or withheld number to obfuscate your digits.
 
However, blocking codes can’t be used to obscure your identity from toll-free numbers. Also, you’re not able to use features such as encrypted texting, and you won’t receive one-time passwords. If either of these are necessary for you, other methods may be a better fit.
 
If you want to implement a withheld number, you’ll need to know the prefix code. In the US, most leading carriers let you use the prefix *67 before the full phone number you’re calling. AT&T customers should use #31# instead.
 
You may find that *67 should work in Canada and some other countries. In the UK, you’ll use 141 as the prefix code, 067 in Spain, 1831 in Australia, 133 in Hong Kong, and 184 in Japan.
 
If you’re unsure of the country prefix code where you are, a quick web search should pull up the details. You could also head to the website of your provider or carrier, where the information should be available.
 
## 2. Use a Virtual Phone Number
 
Virtual phone numbers give you the flexibility to choose another phone number without owning a second SIM card. They can also disguise your identity by transferring your phone calls from a virtual number.
 
You can even pass on this “new” number to your contacts if you’re concerned about your privacy day to day. Though, while there are free services offering virtual private numbers, the results are mixed.
 
Instead, check out Burner and Hushed – two top virtual phone number services.
 
The idea is that these apps reroute your number, so you can stick with the same phone and carrier while keeping unwanted calls at bay. It’s a good permanent solution if you have to pass your number to strangers on a regular basis.
 
## 3. Purchase a Skype Number
 
Voice over IP (VoIP) numbers can also be effective in disguising your identity. A Skype number is one of your prime choices. This is a dedicated phone number that you access through the Skype platform or app.
 
You’re able to share this unique number as you would a standard one. You can even use it to register with WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram and other messaging services.
 
The only drawback with Skype numbers is that you need Internet access to make a VoIP call. Of course, this isn’t unique to Skype’s service, but it does make the process a semi-permanent solution.
 
There are a few ways to get a Skype number. The easiest is to head to the dedicated page on the Skype website and run through the steps to get set up.
 
Note that there are other approaches you can take outlined on the Skype website.
 
## 4. Implement the “Caller ID” Feature of Your Phone
 
Most smartphones have a Caller ID feature that lets you hide your phone number. This is great as a permanent way to hide your number, but it’s a phone-wide setting that can’t be toggled for individual users in most cases.
 
To set up Caller ID on iPhone, head to “Settings -> Phone,” then “Show My Caller ID”:
 
From here, toggle the setting. For Android devices, a Google support ticket outlines the procedure. Be aware that there are minor variations depending on the device you own.
 
Regardless, you’ll have to open the Voice app. On some Android phones, you may need to click the “Call Settings -> Additional Settings” option. Under Calls and Caller ID, turn “Anonymous Caller ID” to On.
 
## In Summary
 
Your phone number is now a privileged piece of information. By choosing to keep yours private, you can discourage telemarketers, stalkers, and cyber-criminals from contacting you and showing malicious intent.
