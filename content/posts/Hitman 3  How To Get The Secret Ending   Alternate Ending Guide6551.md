# Unlock the Hidden Truth in Hitman 3: The Ultimate Guide to the Secret and Alternate Endings!

Hitman 3 has already proven to be a hugely popular game amongst gamers, and for good reason. It offers a range of exciting and challenging missions, a fascinating story, and a variety of different ways to approach each job. However, there's even more that meets the eye when it comes to this game. There are several secret and alternate endings that are waiting to be unlocked. In this ultimate guide, we'll take you through the steps to find each of the secret and alternate endings, so you can uncover the whole story.

## The Secret Ending

The secret ending is the most elusive of all the endings in Hitman 3. To unlock it, you need to complete a series of specific steps in a particular order. Firstly, you need to complete the "The Farewell" mission in Berlin, where you will find a secret tunnel that leads to an underground laboratory. Here, you will encounter a character named Hush. While interacting with him, he will reveal to you his plan to use a virus to bring about global change. You will also find a keycard while exploring the laboratory.

Next, you need to complete the "Apex Predator" mission in Dubai to obtain the lethal poison that Hush wants to use to disseminate his deadly virus. After this, during the "End of an Era" mission in Chongqing, you encounter Olivia Hall, who is trying to collect data on a worldwide scale. This data includes information that Hush needs to distribute the virus. At this point, if you have the keycard from earlier, you can show it to her, and she will reluctantly assist you.

Finally, in the mission "The Farewell," when you encounter Hush again, you will be able to take one of two actions: poison him or let him escape. If you choose to poison him, the final cutscene will reveal the destruction of the world as a result of the virus.

## The Alternate Endings

There are three alternate endings to the game. The first alternate ending is obtained by completing the game normally without unlocking any of the secret missions. The ending shows Agent 47 walking into the sunset, implying that he is leaving the business behind him.

The second alternate ending is unlocked by completing all of the secret missions in the game. This ending depicts Agent 47 reuniting with his former handler, Diana. They both express their desire to continue working together.

Lastly, involving an end-of-level decision on IO Interactive's part, the third alternate ending gives you two choices. You can either shoot the Constant or allow Diana to shoot him. If 47 shoots the Constant, it is revealed that he and Diana go off to live together. If Diana shoots the Constant, she and 47 go their separate ways, implying that Agent 47 is still operating as a contract killer. Both endings seem to be canonized.

## Conclusion

Hitman 3 is an exceptional game that provides ample replay value. With multiple endings, secret missions, and different storylines, it's essential to play through the game several times to be able to experience everything it has to offer. By following our guide, we hope you can fully appreciate and unlock all of the hidden truths in Hitman 3.
