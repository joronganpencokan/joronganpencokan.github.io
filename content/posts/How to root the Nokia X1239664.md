Title: Unlocking Nokia’s Best-Kept Secret: The Ultimate Guide to Rooting the Nokia X!

Introduction:

The Nokia X is a budget-friendly smartphone that can run Android apps without Google Play Services. This phone was released in 2014 and may not have the latest software updates compared to other devices in the market. However, there is a way to unlock the hidden potential of this phone by rooting it. Rooting refers to the process of gaining administrative access to the device’s operating system. In this article, we will provide you with a step-by-step guide to rooting your Nokia X phone.

Step 1: Backup Your Data

Before proceeding with the rooting process, make sure to back up all your important data, including contacts, photos, and files. This is in case something goes wrong and you lose your data. You can backup your data using the Nokia Suite software, which is available on the Nokia X website.

Step 2: Download the Required Files

Download the Nokia X Toolkit software from the XDA Developers forum. This software includes all the necessary tools you need for rooting your Nokia X phone. You can also use other tools like Framaroot if you prefer.

Step 3: Enable USB Debugging

Go to the Settings app on your Nokia X phone and scroll down to the “About phone” section. Tap on the “Build number” seven times to enable Developer options. Now, go back to the main Settings page and scroll down to the “Developer options” section. Enable USB debugging mode.

Step 4: Connect Your Nokia X Phone to Your Computer

Use a USB cable to connect your Nokia X phone to your computer. Make sure the phone’s battery level is above 50 percent before proceeding.

Step 5: Run the Nokia X Toolkit

Open the Nokia X Toolkit software on your computer and select “Root my phone” from the main menu. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the rooting process. The software will install SuperSU on your Nokia X phone, which grants you administrative access to your device.

Step 6: Verify Root Access

Download and install the Root Checker app from the Google Play Store or the Nokia Store. Open the app and tap on “Verify Root Access.” If your phone is rooted successfully, you will see a message that says “Congratulations! Root access is properly installed on this device.”

Conclusion:

Rooting your Nokia X phone can unlock its true potential and allow you to customize it to your liking. However, keep in mind that rooting your phone also comes with risks, such as voiding your phone’s warranty or causing software issues. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully and proceed with caution. With this guide, you can now enjoy all the benefits of rooting your Nokia X phone.

The Nokia X is the Finnish company’s first Android-running smartphone. However, the handset uses on an outdated version of Jelly Bean, instead of KitKat but since Nokia has themed the whole OS to behave like a Windows Phone device, the underlying version of Android does not really matter. On the flip side, using such an old version of Android means that there are quite a few security vulnerabilities and performance issues. The positive side is it makes rooting the Nokia X an extremely easy task via some of the older root-based exploits available for Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean.
If you want to root your Nokia X, follow the steps below:
Step 1: Download this APK file and transfer it to your Nokia X.
Step 2: On your device, head over to Settings / Security and enable the “Unknown sources” option.
Step 3: Using a file manager like Astro (pre-loaded), navigate to the directory where you had transferred the APK file in Step 1.

Step 4: Install the APK file and then proceed to open it. Simply select the “Gandalf” option in the app, after which you will receive a pop-up saying that the device has been successfully rooted. Make sure to reboot your device after this for the changes to take effect.
Once the device has been rooted, you will notice that SuperSu has also been installed to the phone. The app will act like a permission manager for all the apps that require root, allowing you to enable or disable access to them.
With your Nokia X rooted, you can convert it into a normal Android device and can also install the whole suite of Google apps. We will be posting these guides over the coming few days so stay tuned!
