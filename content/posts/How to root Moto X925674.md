Unlock the Secret Powers of Your Moto X - Learn How to Root in Just a Few Simple Steps!

Are you tired of the limitations set forth by the manufacturer on your Moto X? Do you want to unlock the full potential of your device and experience true freedom? The solution to your problem is simple - root your Moto X. 

Rooting, also known as jailbreaking, is the process of gaining access to the root directory of your device, giving you complete control over it. This means that you can install custom ROMs, remove bloatware, and even overclock your device for faster performance. 

In this article, we will guide you through the process of rooting your Moto X in just a few simple steps. But before we begin, it's important to understand the risks associated with rooting. 

Rooting your device can void the warranty, and if not done correctly, can potentially brick your device. However, if you follow the instructions carefully, the benefits of rooting far outweigh the risks. 

Step 1: Back Up Your Device

Before you begin the rooting process, it's important to back up all of your important data. This includes your contacts, messages, photos, and any other important files. There are many backup apps available on the Google Play Store, such as Helium and Titanium Backup, that will help you with this process. 

Step 2: Enable USB Debugging and Unlock the Bootloader

Next, you'll need to enable USB debugging on your Moto X. To do this, go to "Settings" > "Developer options" > "USB debugging" and enable it. 

You will also need to unlock the bootloader on your device. This can be done by following the instructions on the official Motorola website. 

Step 3: Download and Install TWRP Recovery

TWRP Recovery is a custom recovery that allows you to install custom ROMs, create backups, and perform other advanced tasks on your device. You'll need to download the TWRP Recovery file for your device from the official website and then use Fastboot commands to install it. 

Step 4: Download and Install SuperSU

SuperSU is a root management app that will allow you to control which apps on your device have root access. You'll need to download the SuperSU zip file and then flash it using TWRP Recovery. 

Step 5: Reboot Your Device

After installing SuperSU, you'll need to reboot your device. Once your device is up and running, you should see the SuperSU app on your home screen. 

And voila! Your Moto X is now rooted, giving you complete control over your device. From here, you can begin customizing your device to your heart's content. 

In conclusion, rooting your Moto X may seem daunting at first, but with a little patience and attention to detail, it's actually a simple process. Just be sure to follow the instructions carefully and back up your data before beginning. With your new found root access, you can truly unlock the secret powers of your Moto X.

A couple of days ago, we reported that temporary root has been achieved on the Verizon Moto X. Today, the developer has released his full work to the public, which allows Moto X, Droid Ultra, Mini and Maxx handsets on Verizon, AT&T and Sprint network to be rooted easily. 
The rooting process in itself is very easy, but underneath it is quite complicated. Developer Justin Case has done a remarkable job of packaging the whole rooting process inside a single APK, when the actual process itself makes use of multiple exploits.
So, without further ado, here is how you can root your Verizon/AT&T/Rogers/Sprint or US Cellular Moto X -:
Step 1: Head over to this XDA thread, and download the MotoRoot APK file meant for your variant of the Moto X. Make sure to double check that you have downloaded the right APK for your device.

Step 2: Transfer the APK file to your Moto X, and then proceed to install it. Fire the app once it has been installed, and then proceed to tap the ‘Setup’ option.
Step 3: Your Moto X will reboot soon after this. Once the phone boot backs into Android OS, head over to the Play Store and install the SuperSu app from Chainfire.
And that’s about it! You have successfully rooted your Moto X and can now enjoy root enabled apps in their full glory. The root is completely permanent in nature so you don’t need to re-run the app after every reboot. Make sure you never uninstall the app, otherwise root access will be removed.
Also, it is recommend not to accept any future OTA updates from Verizon/AT&T and Motorola if you want to enjoy root access on your Moto X.
