These updates can include device drivers, firmware updates, quality updates, and more. While Windows 11 automatically downloads and installs essential updates, such as security updates, it won't install optional updates by default.

So, why bother installing optional updates? Well, here are a few reasons:

- New features: Optional updates can add new features or improve existing ones, such as better compatibility with your hardware or better performance in specific applications.
- Bug fixes: Optional updates can fix issues that affect specific areas of your system, such as bugs in device drivers, software, or firmware.
- Performance improvements: Optional updates can improve your system's performance, such as reducing boot times or improving battery life.
- Security: Optional updates can improve your system's security, such as fixing vulnerabilities in your system or adding new security features.

While optional updates may not always be necessary, they can help you get the most out of your system.

## How to Install Optional Updates in Windows 11

Now that you know why optional updates are important, it's time to learn how to install them. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Open Settings: You can do this by clicking on the Start button and then clicking on the gear icon in the Start menu.

2. Go to Windows Update: Click on the "Windows Update" option in the left sidebar.

3. Check for updates: Click on the "Check for updates" button in the main window. This will check for essential updates and optional updates.

4. View optional updates: If there are optional updates available, you'll see them listed in the main window under "Optional updates available." Click on the "View optional updates" link to see them.

5. Install optional updates: Check the box next to the updates you want to install, and then click the "Install" button.

6. Restart your system: After the updates are installed, Windows may ask you to restart your system to apply the changes.

Windows 11 includes an option to download and install “optional updates,” which are those updates that are not required (but necessary) to operate the computer properly. Usually, these are packages for Microsoft and third-party products, feature updates, optional monthly updates (release C and D), and device drivers (printers, cameras, network adapters, etc.).
 
Optional updates are not new to Windows 11. The idea of giving you the choice of whether to install specific updates has been available since Windows 10. Also, in the past, you were able to install or update drivers from within Device Manager. However, the option has been removed, and now, they are only available from the “Optional updates” settings page (if applicable).
 
In this guide, you will learn the steps to install optional updates on Windows 11.
