Shocking News: Pixel 6 Faces Early Demise with Guaranteed Support Ending in 2024!

Recently, Google announced some disappointing news regarding their beloved Pixel 6 smartphone line. According to Google, the Pixel 6 will be facing an early demise with guaranteed support ending in 2024. This news has come as a surprise to the smartphone community who were hoping for a longer lifespan for their Pixel 6 device.

The Pixel 6 was released just a few months ago and was greeted with much excitement among tech enthusiasts. It boasted numerous upgrades and was considered to be a flagship phone that would challenge its competitors in the market. However, with this recent announcement, it seems as though the Pixel 6 will be facing a bleak future.

The news of support ending in 2024 has raised concerns over the longevity of the device. Many users were expecting the Pixel 6 to last for a couple of years with constant updates and support from Google. This announcement will undoubtedly come as a blow to those who have invested in the Pixel 6.

Furthermore, Google's decision to end support prematurely is somewhat perplexing. The smartphone market is highly competitive, and consumers are always looking for devices that offer long-term value. By ending support in just three years, Google is sending a message that their smartphones are only meant to last for a short while.

However, Google has assured users that they will continue to provide security updates for the Pixel 6 for a further year. This means that the device will remain secure until 2025. Nonetheless, this may not be enough to satisfy users who were hoping for a longer support period.

The question that remains is whether Google's decision to end support early will affect future sales of the Pixel 6. It is likely that consumers will think twice about purchasing Google smartphones if they are only guaranteed support for a few years. Customers may opt for other brands that offer longer support periods.

In conclusion, Google's decision to end support for the Pixel 6 early has come as a shock to the smartphone community. While the device will still receive security updates until 2025, this may not be enough to satisfy users who were hoping for long-term value from their investment. Only time will tell whether this decision will affect future sales of the Pixel 6, but Google must take note of the growing trend of providing longer support for their devices.

It looks like the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro might not be getting full Android support past the three-year mark.

 

Google's new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro smartphones could have a shorter shelf life than you might expect. According to a Google support page on the Pixel, the company's five-year coverage plan actually only includes security updates—Android support may end much sooner.

 

According to Google, both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro will receive (and continue to receive) security support through updates until "at least" October 2026. However, it's only guaranteeing Android version updates through October 2024—three years from when the Pixel 6 became available on the Google Store. Google also shows that support for older models like the Pixel 5a and Pixel 4a will likely cease about three years from their initial release dates. So while your Pixel 6 will continue to receive security updates for the next five years, Android OS updates are only guaranteed for the next three.

 

As The Verge points out, this is in pretty stark contrast to the longevity of Apple's support for the iPhone—with the iPhone 6S recently seeing iOS 15 support. At 6 years old, that gives the 6S twice the support window of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.

 

Both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are available for preorder now, starting at $599 and $899 respectively, and will release on October 28.
