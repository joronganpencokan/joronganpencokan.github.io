If you click on I already know this then the next time you play the video that word will not be included the next time you play the video. If you click on the Want to learn this button the app knows to keep that word in your learning vocabulary.

 
- When you think you’ve learned the phrases go back to the lessons and click on Play. The app will them ask you to translate the highlighted phrase. You’ll see four different answers. Make sure you choose the right one and if you do the phrase will be highlighted and the answer will be in green.
 - If you chose the wrong answer it will be highlighted in red with the right answer being displayed in green. The quiz will last the entire video and once you’re done you get 10 Lango coins for each right answer you gave. Remember, these coins are what will unlock more songs.
