Title: You won't BELIEVE how EASY it is to REMOVE Standard, Admin and Guest Users from your Mac!

Introduction
Are you concerned about security on your Mac? Do you want to protect your private data and ensure that no one else can access it? Removing standard, admin, and guest users from your Mac can be the solution. In this article, we will explain how easy it is to remove these users from your Mac and why it is important.

Step 1: Open System Preferences
The first thing you need to do is open System Preferences. You can do this by clicking on the Apple icon on the top left side of your screen and selecting System Preferences from the drop-down menu.

Step 2: Click on Users & Groups
Once you have opened System Preferences, click on the Users & Groups icon. This will give you access to all the user accounts on your Mac.

Step 3: Select the user you want to remove
In the left-hand column, you will see a list of all users on your Mac. Select the user you want to remove by clicking on their name.

Step 4: Click on the minus sign
After selecting the user you want to remove, click on the minus sign (-) at the bottom of the column. This will remove the user from your Mac.

Step 5: Confirm deletion
A pop-up window will appear asking you to confirm that you want to delete the user. Click on Delete User to confirm.

Repeat these steps for all the standard, admin, and guest users that you want to remove from your Mac.

Why is it important to remove standard, admin, and guest users?
Removing these users is important for your Mac's security. Standard users have limited access to your system, but they can still potentially access your private data. Admin users, on the other hand, have full access to your system and can make changes that can harm your Mac or compromise your data. Guest users are even more dangerous since they have the ability to create a new user account and potentially gain full access to your system. By removing all these users, you ensure that your Mac is safe and secure.

Conclusion
As you can see, removing standard, admin, and guest users from your Mac is incredibly easy. It only takes a few clicks, and it can make a huge difference in your Mac's security. So, take a few minutes to remove any users you don't need and keep your Mac safe from potential threats.

## Remove User from Mac Comfortably


With the above steps, you can conveniently delete users from Mac, and the process remains more or less similar on MacBooks out there.
The easiest option is to disable the guest user in System Preferences by unchecking the checkbox for Allow guests to login in to this computer. You will find this under Users & Groups section.
But there are some situations when this won't work. For example, if you have enabled "Find My Mac", this option to permanently disable guest login won't work. The reason Apple has made it this way is in case your Mac gets lost, someone has to login to the Mac in order to connect to the WiFi and send its latest location
A macOS app bundle (.app file) can technically reside anywhere. A user's Home directory is also deleted when they delete their account. Thus, all the apps installed by the user in the root /Applications directory remain unaffected.
Simply put, since user files are hidden between each other, if you were able to use an app installed by another user, you will be able to access it even after their account has been deleted.
