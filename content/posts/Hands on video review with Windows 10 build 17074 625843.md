Introduction

If you're a Windows 10 user, you're probably aware of the build release system that Microsoft operates. With each new build, features are added, bugs are fixed and the overall quality of the operating system is improved. Build 17074 is the latest to be released and we must say, it does not disappoint. In this article, we'll take a look at some of the new features and improvements in this build and what it means for Windows 10 users.

Windows Diagnostic Data Viewer

One of the things that Windows 10 has been criticized for is the amount of data it collects from users. This includes data related to your system usage, personal information, and browsing habits. With Build 17074, Microsoft has introduced a new app called Windows Diagnostic Data Viewer that allows you to view all the diagnostic data that is sent to Microsoft. This app gives you more control over your privacy and allows you to control the data that is being shared.

Near Share

If you've ever tried to share a file between two Windows 10 devices, you'll know that it's not always easy. Well, with Build 17074, Microsoft has introduced a new feature called Near Share. This feature allows you to share files with other Windows 10 devices using Bluetooth. This means you can quickly share a document or photo with someone sitting next to you without having to go through the trouble of emailing it.

Quiet Hours

If you've ever been in a meeting or at the cinema and your phone starts buzzing with notifications, you'll know how annoying it can be. With Build 17074, Microsoft has introduced a new feature called Quiet Hours. This feature lets you set a time when you don't want to be disturbed by notifications. During this time, notifications will be suppressed and will only be visible if you manually check them.

Cortana Improvements

Cortana is Microsoft's digital assistant that is built into Windows 10. With Build 17074, Microsoft has made some improvements to this feature. Cortana can now read your emails aloud, which is helpful if you're driving or unable to look at your screen. It also has a new set-up experience that makes it easier to configure and use.

Conclusion

Build 17074 is a great update for Windows 10 users. The new features and improvements show that Microsoft is listening to its users and is committed to improving the overall user experience. From improved privacy to new sharing options, this build has a lot to offer. If you haven't updated yet, we highly recommend that you do.
