# You won't believe how easy it is to kick someone off your Hulu account with these simple steps!

Have you ever shared your Hulu account with someone only to realize that they never log out? Or maybe, you've given access to a friend or family member, but now you want to revoke their access. Whatever the reason may be, it's important to know how to kick someone off your Hulu account. Fortunately, it's a quick and easy process that can be done in just a few simple steps. 

## Step 1: Log in to your Hulu account

The first step in removing someone from your Hulu account is to log in to your Hulu account on a web browser. You can't remove someone from the account using the Hulu app. 

Once you've logged in, look for your account name in the top right corner of the screen. Click on the account name to open the drop-down menu.

## Step 2: Click on "Account"

In the drop-down menu, you'll see several options. Click on "Account" to go to your account settings. 

## Step 3: Scroll down to "Your Account"

Once you're on the Account page, scroll down the page to the "Your Account" section. 

## Step 4: Click on "Manage Devices"

In the "Your Account" section, you'll see a button that says "Manage Devices." Click on that button to open up the devices that are currently logged into your Hulu account. 

## Step 5: Remove the device

Now that you're in the "Manage Devices" section, you can see all the devices that are currently logged into your account. To remove a device, simply click on "Remove" next to the device that you want to kick off your Hulu account. 

## Step 6: Confirm removal

Once you've clicked "Remove," a pop-up window will appear asking you to confirm the removal of the device. Click "Yes" to confirm the removal. 

And that's it! You've successfully kicked someone off your Hulu account. It's important to remember that this will only remove the device from your account. If the person you removed knows your login information, they can still log back in. To prevent this, make sure to change your account's password. 

In conclusion, kicking someone off your Hulu account is a simple and easy process. All you need to do is log in, go to your account settings, manage devices, and remove the device you want to kick off. Remember to change your password to prevent unauthorized access to your account. Now, you can enjoy your Hulu subscription without having to share it with anyone who's overstayed their welcome.

This article explains how to kick someone off Hulu, including instructions for removing one person, removing everyone, and removing a name from your Hulu account.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- To kick someone off Hulu: Open the Hulu website, navigate to Account > Manage Devices, locate their device, and select REMOVE. To kick everyone off Hulu: Navigate to Account > Protect Your Account > Log Out of All Devices. After you’ve kicked someone off Hulu, make sure to change your password: Account > Change Password.

 
##   Can You Kick Someone off Hulu?  
 

You have control over who accesses your Hulu account, and you can kick anyone off at any time by removing their devices from your account. When you do that, they won’t be able to use your account again unless they log back in or reactivate their device.

 

Doing this is helpful if you’ve given access to someone and want to revoke it or if you suspect that your password has been stolen.

 

Here’s how to kick someone off Hulu:

 
Hulu only lets you stream to two devices at once. If that isn’t enough for your family, the Hulu + Live TV service enables you to pay extra to remove the two-device limit.
 
- Open Hulu in a web browser, and move your mouse over the profile icon in the upper right corner.
 - Click Account and enter your password if prompted.
 - Click MANAGE DEVICES.
 - Locate the device you want to kick off, and click REMOVE.
 - If you see a device that you don’t recognize, your account may be compromised. After removing the unfamiliar device, make sure to change your password on the Hulu website by clicking your profile icon > Account > Change Password.

 
##   How to Kick Everyone Off Hulu  
 

If you have a lot of devices connected to your Hulu account that you don't recognize, or you don't know how to tell, you can remove all of the connected devices at once. When you do that, it removes every device that you have ever authorized to use your Hulu account immediately. That means you'll have to log back in on each one before you can use them again.

 

Open Hulu in a web browser, and move your mouse over the profile icon in the upper right corner.

 

Click Account and enter your password if prompted.

 

Click MANAGE DEVICES.

 

Locate the device you want to kick off, and click REMOVE.

 
 If you see a device that you don’t recognize, your account may be compromised. After removing the unfamiliar device, make sure to change your password on the Hulu website by clicking your profile icon > Account > Change Password.
 

It's a good option if you think your password may have been stolen. If that's the case, then it's crucial to create a new strong password immediately after you kick everyone off your Hulu account to prevent anyone from getting back on without your permission.

 

Here's how to kick everyone off your Hulu account at once:

 
- Open the Hulu website, and move your mouse over the profile icon in the upper right corner.
 - Click Account.
 - Click Protect Your Account in the Privacy and Settings section.
 - Click LOG OUT OF ALL DEVICES.
 - Make sure to change your password if you suspect your password may have been stolen.

 
##   What Happens When You Remove a Device From Hulu?  
 

When you remove a device from Hulu, that device can no longer stream using your Hulu account. If someone is streaming on that device, their stream will end, and Hulu will prompt them to log in or activate their device. If they have your password, they’ll be able to log back in. If they don’t have your password, they’ll have to contact you for assistance to reconnect their device to your account.

 

Open the Hulu website, and move your mouse over the profile icon in the upper right corner.

 

Click Account.

 

Click Protect Your Account in the Privacy and Settings section.

 

Click LOG OUT OF ALL DEVICES.

 
Make sure to change your password if you suspect your password may have been stolen.
 

The best way to stop sharing Hulu is to change your password and remove the devices from your Hulu account. If you suspect that your password has been stolen, then you can either change your password and remove any suspicious devices or log out of all connected devices to be safe. In either case, you should change your password. If you don’t, the owner of the removed devices will be able to reconnect them whenever they like.

 
##   How Do I Remove a Name From My Hulu Account?  
 

Hulu lets you set up six profiles. Each profile has a watch history and favorites, so most people set up a new profile whenever they share their account. If you don't want to share anymore, you can remove that name from your Hulu account to make room for new ones or clean up the profile selection interface.

 

Here’s how to remove a name from your Hulu account:

 
Removing a name from Hulu can’t be undone. Deleting a profile is permanent, and Hulu can’t recover the associated watch history and favorites.
