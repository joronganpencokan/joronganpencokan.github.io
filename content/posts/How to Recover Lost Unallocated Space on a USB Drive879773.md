As someone who relies heavily on their USB drive for storage and transfer of files, losing data can be a nightmare. Unfortunately, it happened to me a while ago. I plugged in my USB drive, only to be greeted with error messages that the drive needed to be formatted before it could be used. I had no choice but to format the drive, and in the process, I lost over 50GB of critical data. I was devastated.

That experience taught me the importance of data backups, but more importantly, it prompted me to learn how to recover lost data from a USB drive – specifically unallocated space. Unallocated space refers to the area on a hard drive or USB drive that has not been assigned a file system. This space is not accessible through regular means, and hence any data stored in the unallocated space cannot be accessed until you recover it.

In this article, I will share with you the steps I took to recover over 50GB of lost storage on my USB drive.

## Step 1: Stop the Usage of the USB drive

Once you notice data loss from your USB drive, the first thing you should do is stop using the drive. This is because any further data written to the drive could overwrite your lost data, making it impossible to recover.

## Step 2: Download and install a data recovery tool

To recover lost data from a USB drive, you need a reliable data recovery tool. After some research, I settled on EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard. This tool is user-friendly and has a high success rate in data recovery.

## Step 3: Connect the USB drive to your computer

Connect the USB drive to your computer and launch the data recovery tool that you downloaded in step 2.

## Step 4: Select the USB drive in the data recovery tool

Once the data recovery tool is launched, it will display all the drives connected to your computer. Choose the USB drive that you want to recover lost data from and click "Scan."

## Step 5: Scan for lost data

The data recovery tool will start scanning the USB drive for lost data. You can select different scanning modes depending on the level of data loss. The scanning process may take a while depending on the size of the USB drive.

## Step 6: Preview and Recover the lost data

After the scan is completed, the data recovery tool will display a list of all the recoverable data. Preview the data to confirm that it is indeed the data you had lost, then select it and click "Recover." The recovered data can be saved in any folder on your computer.

## Step 7: Format the USB drive

After recovering the lost data, it is always prudent to format the USB drive to ensure that the drive is functioning optimally.

In conclusion, losing data from a USB drive can be frustrating, but it is not the end of the world. With reliable data recovery tools such as EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard, you can recover lost data from unallocated space on your USB drive. Remember to always create backups of your critical data and avoid using your USB drive after data loss to avoid overwriting the lost data.
