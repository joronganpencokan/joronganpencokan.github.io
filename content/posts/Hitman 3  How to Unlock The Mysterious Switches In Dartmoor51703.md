# You Won't Believe What Secrets the Hidden Switches in Hitman 3's Dartmoor Hold! Unlock Them Now with Our Expert Guide

Hitman 3 has been a massive success since its release in January 2021. It's the final installment in the "World of Assassination" trilogy and has been widely praised by both fans and critics alike for its immersive gameplay and stunning graphics. One of the most interesting levels in the game is set in Dartmoor, a luxurious mansion in the English countryside. The Dartmoor level is full of secrets, including hidden switches that can unlock new areas of the mansion. In this guide, we'll show you how to find and unlock these switches to uncover the secrets of Dartmoor.

## Step 1: Explore the Mansion

The first step to finding the switches in Dartmoor is to explore the mansion thoroughly. The mansion is huge and has many rooms to explore, so take your time and make sure you visit every room. Use your instinct mode to scan the environment and look for any interactive objects. Keep an eye out for bookcases, paintings, and other objects that look out of place. These objects may hold the key to unlocking the hidden switches in Dartmoor.

## Step 2: Find the Secret Study

To find the first switch, you need to locate the secret study in the mansion. The study is hidden behind a bookcase in the library on the ground floor. To access the study, push the button on the wall located behind the bookcase. Once in the study, you'll find a suspicious painting on the wall. Use your instinct mode to reveal a switch behind the painting. Flip the switch to unlock a secret passage leading to the attic.

## Step 3: Unlock the Attic

To access the attic, you need to use the secret passage you unlocked in the previous step. The passage leads to a locked door, which requires a key to access. The key is located in the master bedroom on the second floor. Once you have the key, use it to unlock the door and access the attic. In the attic, you'll find a switch that unlocks a door on the third floor.

## Step 4: Access the Secret Room

The final switch is located in a secret room on the third floor of the mansion. To access the room, you need to use the switch you unlocked in the attic. The door to the secret room is located behind a painting in the hallway. Use your instinct mode to reveal the door, and then use the switch to unlock it. Once inside the secret room, you'll find a safe that requires a code to open. The code can be found on a piece of paper located on a table in the same room. Enter the code into the safe to unlock it and reveal the final secret of Dartmoor.

In conclusion, Hitman 3's Dartmoor level is full of secrets, and unlocking the hidden switches is an essential part of uncovering them all. By following this guide, you'll be able to find and unlock all the switches in Dartmoor, revealing new areas of the mansion and uncovering its secrets. Happy hunting, Agent 47!

## How to Unlock The Mysterious Switches In Dartmoor?
 
On the balcony of the room where the dead body is look for an agent. Kill him and disguise as an agent, not as the investigator or private security guard. If you are wearing the identity of a building guard you can move freely around. So get the suit and be ready with a lockpick.
 

 
Exit the room, turn right towards the window. Take the first entrance towards the right and continue straight to the door in your front. This is Emma & Gregory’s room.  If you are not having the picklock then you might have to break the door. Lock pick is safe and will not catch others’ interest, collect the Walking Cane from inside. It is a special device to use the mysterious switches in Hitman 3.
