Introduction:

Hitman 3, the third and final installment of the Hitman trilogy, has been a massive success among gamers worldwide. One of the most intriguing levels in the game is the Dartmoor level, where Agent 47, the protagonist, poses as a detective to investigate the sudden death of Alexa Carlisle, a wealthy British matriarch. The level requires the player to explore the vast mansion and its surroundings to gather clues and evidence to identify the killer.

Among the many rooms that Agent 47 needs to investigate in the Dartmoor level, Emma and Gregory's room is one of the most significant. This article will provide a comprehensive guide to all the hidden secrets in this room that you won't believe.

Section 1: The Layout of Emma and Gregory's Room

The room is located on the second floor of the mansion and has an elegant, sophisticated interior design. The room is divided into three main areas: the sleeping area, the dressing area, and the bathroom. Each area has unique clues and secrets that the player can discover by exploring the room.

Section 2: The Sleeping Area

In the sleeping area, the player can find a critical piece of evidence that proves Emma Carlisle's involvement in the murder of her grandfather, Alexa Carlisle. The evidence is hidden in the drawer of Emma's bedside table. To access the drawer, the player needs to find the key that is lying on the floor near the door. Inside the drawer, the player can find a letter from Emma to Alexa, where she confesses to conspiring with Gregory to kill Alexa.

Section 3: The Dressing Area

The dressing area has two main secrets that the player can discover. The first secret is hidden behind the portrait of Mr. Fernsby, the Carlisle family butler. The player needs to interact with the portrait to reveal a small compartment with a crowbar. The crowbar can be used to break open a locked drawer in the sleeping area that contains additional evidence related to the murder.

The second secret in the dressing area is hidden inside the closet. If the player examines the closet closely, they can find a hidden panel under the clothes. Inside the panel, they can find a remote control that opens a secret passageway to Alexa's private room.

Section 4: The Bathroom

The bathroom also has hidden secrets that the player can discover by exploring the room. The first secret is the medicine cabinet, which has a fake bottom. The fake bottom conceals a small compartment with a wrench that can be used to sabotage the gas valve outside the mansion.

The second secret in the bathroom is the mirror, which has a hidden message behind it. The message is written in glow-in-the-dark ink and can only be seen in the dark. The message reveals the code to open Alexa's safe in her private room.

In conclusion, Emma and Gregory's room in the Dartmoor level of Hitman 3 is full of hidden secrets and clues that are essential to solving the murder of Alexa Carlisle. By exploring the sleeping area, dressing area, and bathroom, the player can discover evidence that proves Emma and Gregory's involvement in the crime and access secret passageways and safes that contain additional evidence.
