Title: You won't BELIEVE what we discovered: The SHOCKING truth about how to know if your Instagram messages have been read!

Subtitle: Understanding the ins and outs of Instagram message notifications

Instagram is one of the largest social media platforms in the world with over a billion users. The platform is known for its photo and video sharing capabilities but it also has a messaging feature that enables users to communicate with one another. Instagram messages work like other messaging platforms with users sending messages to each other either for personal or business reasons.

However, not knowing if someone has read your Instagram message can be frustrating to many. Instagram does not provide a read receipt feature for messages like some other messaging platforms provide. This means that you never know whether someone has seen your message or not. But is it possible to know if someone has read your Instagram message? Keep reading to find out!

First, let's understand how Instagram notifications work regarding messages. Instagram notifications will pop up on your phone when someone sends you a message. These notifications are the easiest way to know when someone has sent you a message without actually having to open the app. However, Instagram notifications only notify you that someone has sent you a message and not whether they have seen your message or not.

So how can you know if someone has read your Instagram message? The answer to that question is surprisingly simple. Instagram has an 'Activity Status' feature that enables you to see when someone was last active online. This feature is the best way to know if someone has read your message since it tells you when they were last active online. If someone was last active on Instagram a few minutes ago, chances are they have seen your message.

Another way to know if someone has read your Instagram message is by sending a direct response. When someone reads your Instagram message, the message box will change from a delivered message to a seen message. If you are unsure if someone has read your message, try sending a response to it. If you see the message box switch to seen, then you know that the recipient has read your message.

In conclusion, knowing if someone has read your Instagram message can be challenging since Instagram does not provide a read receipt feature. However, the two methods above can help you determine if someone has read your message or not. The activity status feature and sending a direct response are the best ways to determine if someone has read your Instagram message. Now that you know the ins and outs of Instagram message notifications, you can enjoy communicating with your Instagram friends without worrying about whether your message has been opened or not.

No, on Instagram, you cannot disable read receipts, but you can read messages secretively by first switching to airplane mode.
