# Unleash The Winning Strategies: The Foolproof Way To Max Out Champions In Teamfight Tactics!

Teamfight Tactics is a game that requires a lot of skill and strategy. One of the most important aspects of the game is to maximize your champions’ potential. While it may seem like a simple task, several factors go into making a champion powerful.

Here are some of the foolproof ways to max out champions in Teamfight Tactics:

**1. Positioning**

The position of your champions can significantly affect their performance in battle. If they are in a bad spot, they can easily get focused and eliminated quickly. On the other hand, if they are placed in strategic locations, they can deal a lot of damage while staying protected.

Positioning is also important when trying to take down your opponents’ champions. By positioning your champions correctly, you can target their more vulnerable units and take them out quickly.

**2. Itemization**

The items that you equip on your champions are essential in maximizing their potential. Each item has a unique effect that can improve your champion’s abilities. For example, equipping a Rapid Firecannon can significantly improve your champion’s attack range, while equipping a Deathblade can increase their damage output.

Try to experiment with different combinations of items to see which ones work best for each of your champions. Also, keep in mind the synergies that certain items have with specific champion traits.

**3. Synergies**

Synergies are the interactions that occur between champions with specific traits. When you have multiple champions with the same trait on the board at the same time, they will receive a bonus that improves their ability and performance.

For example, if you have multiple Void champions on your team, they will receive a bonus that reduces their enemy’s armor. By building your team around specific synergies, you are making your champions much more powerful than they would be individually.

**4. Leveling up and Rolling**

Leveling up and rolling are two crucial aspects of Teamfight Tactics that can make or break your game. Leveling up allows you to place more champions on the board, which will give you more opportunities to create synergies and maximize your potential.

Rolling is a technique that involves spending gold at the shop to reroll the available champions in search of specific ones. Keeping your gold balance in check while maximizing your chances of obtaining the necessary champions is a vital strategy that can significantly improve your chances of winning.

In conclusion, maximizing your champions’ potential in Teamfight Tactics requires a lot of careful planning and strategy. By keeping the above factors in mind and experimenting with different combinations of items and champions, you can create a deadly team that can take down even the most formidable opponents. Good luck!

From the developers of the critically acclaimed League of Legends comes Teamfight Tactics. Riot Games has crafted this fantastic auto-battler game where the arena is none other than a chessboard. Your units consist of champions who battle it out against seven real-life opponents to protect the Little Legend. While every champion is blessed with special abilities, you would be wasting their potential if you don’t know how to level them up. Here is how to level up champions in Teamfight Tactics.
 
## How to Upgrade Champions in Teamfight Tactics
 
As you progress in the game, you will add several units to your game board. When this happens, you will run out of space to get new units. This is critical as a dynamic group of champions can improve your odds of victory during battles. This is the time when you should know how to level up Champions in Teamfight Tactics. Upgrading your individual units will give them additional bonuses in the form of higher HP, greater damage, and improved overall base stats.
 

 
At the very start, champions will have a base star rating of 1. Once you collect three of the same champion, it will automatically level up to a 2-star rating. In the same way, once you have three 2-star champions, they will automatically turn into a single 3-star champion.
 
To make things a little easier to grasp, we have summarized the whole concept:
 
- Three 1-Star champions = One 2-star champion
 - Three 2-star champions = One 3-star champion

 
Ensure that you have at least nine 1-star champions. Only then will you be able to complete the next two level-ups. Keep in mind that Level 3 is a champion’s third and final form. You won’t be able to upgrade them any further.
