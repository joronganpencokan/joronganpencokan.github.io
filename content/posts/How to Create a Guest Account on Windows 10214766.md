# Uncover the Top Secret Trick to Unlocking Windows 10's Hidden Guest Account!

If you are a Windows 10 user, you may have heard of the hidden guest account feature. This account allows people to log in and use the computer without creating a new user profile. However, accessing the account can be a tricky task if you are not familiar with the operating system's mechanics. In this article, we will outline the simple steps that can help you unlock Windows 10’s hidden guest account.

## Step 1: Open Command Prompt

The first step to unlocking the guest account is to open the command prompt. You can do this by pressing the Windows key + R simultaneously and typing in 'cmd' in the Run dialogue box. Press Enter or click OK to launch the Command Prompt.

## Step 2: Enable the Guest Account

Once you have the Command Prompt open, type in the following command: “net user guest/active: yes” and press Enter. This will enable the guest account feature. When you log out of your current user account, you will notice that the guest account has appeared on the login screen.

## Step 3: Set a Password for the Guest Account

By default, the guest account does not have a password, which can pose a security risk. To set a password, type in the following command in the Command Prompt: “net user guest password" where 'password' is the password you want to set. Press Enter, and the password will be set.

## Step 4: Disable the Guest Account

If you want to disable the guest account feature, you can do so by typing in this command in the Command Prompt: “net user guest/active: no". This will disable the account, and it will no longer be visible on the login screen.

## Conclusion

Unlocking the guest account feature in Windows 10 is a quick and easy process. By following these simple steps, you can enable, set a password, and disable the guest account at will. However, it is important to remember that the guest account does not have administrator privileges, so it is essential to use it carefully. With this knowledge, you can make use of this hidden feature and improve your user experience on Windows 10!

Once again, Windows 10 changes the way we create and manage users. Learning how to add a new user in Windows is easy, even though it has a new location, and it even comes with more options.
 
Windows 10 allows us to create two types of users: Family and other users. Family is divided among adults and kids. The difference being that the adults category puts limits on what the kids can use, primarily exercising parental control over the children.
 
Creating a guest account on a Windows 10 computer is very easy. There are two ways you can create an account.
 
## Method 1
 
1. Go to the Start menu and begin typing “user.” You should be able to see User Accounts at the top; click on it.
 

 
2. Click on Manage Another Account.
 
3. Click on Add a New User in PC Settings.
 
4. Make sure you are in the Family and Other users section and at the bottom right-hand corner, click on Add someone else to this PC.
 
5. In the next window you will be asked how this person is going to sign it. At the bottom click on The person I want to add doesn´t have an email address.
 
6. Click on Add a user without a Microsoft account.
 
7. To finish up, you will need to fill in the name. You can’t just use “guest.” You will also need to add a password, but it can be something as easy as 123456. To finish, just click on the next button that will be highlighted in blue.
 
To see if your guest account has been added correctly, you need to go back to the Start button and type “user” again. Go to “User Accounts” just like you did in the beginning, and click on Manage another account.
 
You should be able to see the guest account right beside yours.
 
### How to Activate the Guest Account
 
Congratulations! You have created your Windows 10 guest account. After setting it up you need to activate it. To do this you need to click on the Start button and left click on your name; you will see a switch to Guest.

2. Under Local Users and Groups, click on Users.
 
3. Click on Guest in the middle column, and a Guest Properties windows will appear. Type in the name you want the guest account to have.
 
4. Don´t forget to unclick Account is Disabled so this method can work. Save your changes by clicking on the Apply and OK buttons on the bottom right-hand side of the box.
 
5. To check if everything was done correctly, go to the Start button, click on your name and you should be able to see the guest account you just created.
