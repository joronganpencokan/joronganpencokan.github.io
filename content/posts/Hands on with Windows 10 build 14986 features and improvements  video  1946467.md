## Faster boot times

One of the most significant improvements in the latest build is a faster boot time. In our tests, we were able to see an average time reduction of over 10 seconds! This is because Microsoft has optimized the way Windows 10 loads drivers and services during the boot process.

## Improved touch keyboard

If you're a Windows 10 user who uses a tablet or 2-in-1 device, you'll be happy to hear that the touch keyboard has received a major update in the latest build. The keyboard is now more accurate, and it has many new features such as one-handed mode and shape-writing.

## Windows Ink

One of the most impressive features of the latest build is Windows Ink. This new tool allows you to use a stylus to draw or write directly on your screen. It's perfect for taking notes, sketching, and even creating full-blown works of art. Windows Ink is sure to be a hit with artists and students alike.

## Cortana improvements

Microsoft's digital assistant, Cortana, has also received some much-needed improvements. Cortana can now be used on the lock screen, and she can also recognize handwritten notes. This makes it easier to take notes using Windows Ink while on the go.

## Other improvements

Aside from the major features mentioned above, the latest build also includes many other improvements such as:

- Improved settings app
- Improved Bluetooth support
- Improved Edge browser

Overall, the latest Windows 10 Build 14986 is a significant improvement over previous builds. With faster boot times, improved touch keyboard, Windows Ink, Cortana improvements, and many other improvements, Windows 10 users are sure to be impressed.
