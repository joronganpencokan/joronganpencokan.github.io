# Life-Saving Trick: Learn How To Make Alexa Call 911 In Case Of Emergency!

In today's day and age, we rely on technology more than ever before, and devices like Alexa have become an integral part of our daily lives. Alexa is a voice-activated assistant designed by Amazon that can answer questions, control smart home devices, and even make calls for us. But did you know that Alexa can also be a lifesaver in case of an emergency?

Making a 911 call with Alexa is a quick and easy process, and with just a few simple steps, you can set it up on your device. Here’s how to do it:

## Step 1: Open the Alexa app

The first step is to open the Alexa app on your smartphone or tablet. If you don't have the app installed, you can download it for free from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

## Step 2: Go to Settings

Once you're in the Alexa app, go to the "Settings" menu in the bottom right corner of the screen. From there, select "Communication" and then "911".

## Step 3: Enable 911 support

To enable 911 support on Alexa, toggle the switch to the "on" position. You'll also need to provide your home address, which will be used to send emergency responders to your location.

## Step 4: Test the feature

Once you've enabled 911 support on Alexa, it's important to test it to make sure it works properly. To do this, simply say "Alexa, call 911" and the device will immediately place a call to emergency services. You can cancel the call at any time by saying "Cancel."

## Step 5: Use the feature in an emergency

In case of an emergency, simply say "Alexa, call 911" and Alexa will initiate a call to emergency services. It's important to note that Alexa can only call 911 in the US, and it's not available in other countries.

While Alexa can be a valuable tool to have in case of an emergency, it's still important to remember that it's not a substitute for a traditional 911 call. If possible, it's always best to call 911 directly and speak to an emergency operator. However, in situations where you're unable to do so, having Alexa at your disposal can be a life-saver.

In conclusion, learning how to make Alexa call 911 in case of an emergency is a simple yet crucial step that can potentially save lives. It's an easy feature to set up on your device, and it can give you peace of mind knowing that you have another option in case of an emergency. So take a few minutes to enable this feature and be prepared for any emergency that may arise.

### 
What to Know
 
##   Alexa Can Call 911 With Echo Connect  
 

Echo Connect is compatible with the following Alexa devices:

 
- Echo (1st and 2nd generation) Echo Dot (1st and 2nd generation) Echo PlusEcho Show Echo Spot

 

In addition to an Echo device and existing landline or VoIP home phone service, you will need to access the Alexa app on a smartphone or log in to alexa.amazon.com on a computer.

 

If you use the Echo Connect in addition to your Echo device, you'll be able to say, “Alexa, call 911,” and Alexa will connect you with local emergency services. 

 
##   Alexa Skills for Emergency Help  
 

If you prefer not to add another device or do not have a home telephone service, several skills could get you connected to someone who can help you in an emergency. Still, none of the following are 911 emergency services.

 
###   Ask My Buddy  
 

This skill is not a substitute for 911. However, if you add this skill and set up your contacts, you can tell Alexa, “Ask My Buddy to send help,” and the people you choose will be alerted by text/SMS or voice phone calls. 

 
###   My SOS Family Skill  
 

The people in your network don’t need an app when you use this skill (which does not call 911). Once you set up an account with My SOS Family, you can add unlimited contacts to get in touch with emergencies. Your contacts will receive text/SMS and voice phone calls.

 
###   SafeTrek Skill  
 

Although this skill is still not a replacement for calling 911 directly, it might be a good option if you don’t have contacts close enough to help you physically in an emergency. With this skill enabled, if you say "Alexa, tell SafeTrek to send help,” a Five Diamond Certified SafeTrek agent will send help to your home.

 
This is not a free service.
 

Technology is constantly advancing and evolving. You may be able to ask Alexa to call 911 very soon, and it will do so. Until then, these alternatives can help keep you and your family safe.
