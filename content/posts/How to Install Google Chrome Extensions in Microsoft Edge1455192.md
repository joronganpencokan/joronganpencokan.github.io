# Unlock Incredible Features on Microsoft Edge - Learn How to Install Google Chrome Extensions Now!

Microsoft Edge has come a long way since its release in 2015. Originally introduced as the default browser for Windows 10, it has since undergone numerous updates and improvements to become a solid competitor to the likes of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

One notable change that has helped improve Edge's popularity is the ability to install Google Chrome extensions. This feature was introduced in 2019, and it allows Edge users to browse the Chrome Web Store and download their favorite extensions just like they could on Chrome.

So, how do you go about installing Google Chrome extensions on Edge? It's actually a pretty simple process. Here's how to do it:

1. Install the latest version of Microsoft Edge

Before you can install Chrome extensions, you'll need to make sure you're running the latest version of Microsoft Edge. You can check for updates and download them from the Settings menu.

2. Enable Chrome extension support

Once you have the latest version of Edge installed, you'll need to enable support for Chrome extensions. To do this, open Edge and go to the "Extensions" menu. From there, toggle on "Allow extensions from other stores."

3. Browse the Chrome Web Store and install your favorite extensions

Now that you've enabled Chrome extension support, you can browse the Chrome Web Store and download your favorite extensions. Simply find an extension you'd like to install and click "Add to Chrome." Edge will automatically download and install the extension for you.

Some popular extensions you might want to try include AdBlock Plus, LastPass, and Grammarly. There are also numerous productivity and entertainment extensions available, so you're sure to find something that suits your needs.

By enabling support for Chrome extensions, you'll unlock a whole new world of features and functionality on Microsoft Edge. Whether you're looking to improve your productivity or enhance your browsing experience, there's an extension out there that can help you achieve your goals.

When it was first announced, Microsoft’s decision to adopt Chromium code was met with skepticism. The launch of Edge, the company’s Chromium-based browser, is the latest attempt to dethrone Google Chrome. Gone are the days of Microsoft running its own proprietary software. 
 
A new Microsoft Edge is attempting to dethrone Google by attacking from the inside. Claiming better performance across the board, Microsoft is combining the best of two worlds. One of the biggest advantages of Edge is the ability to run Google Chrome extensions. In other words, Microsoft Edge users can get all of the advantages of Chrome without actually using Chrome. Sound good? Here’s how to run those Chrome extensions.
 
## Download Edge
 
First, you need to start by downloading the latest version of the Edge browser. You can do that at microsoft.com, and your existing browser will determine the appropriate download package. Edge is currently available for Windows 10, macOS and mobile software for both Android and iOS. 
 
Building it on the same Chromium code base allows all desktop-based Edge users to tap into the incredibly large selection of Chrome extensions. Microsoft has its own selection of extensions as well, downloadable through the Microsoft Store. As of this writing, the native extension selection is rather limited. Honestly, that is okay, as there are so many Chrome extensions, Microsoft can take its sweet time to increase the native selection.
 
## Finding the Extensions Menu
 
After Edge is installed on your computer, adding Chrome extensions is relatively easy. Once you have the hang of it, you’ll be installing extensions at will in just a few seconds. Let’s get started.
 
- Find the three horizontal dots, or ellipses, in the upper-right corner of the browser to open up the menu.Now, drag your mouse down and click “Extensions” in the menu.After hitting extensions, a new tab will open in the browser. Follow the next steps to keep going.

 
## Enabling Third-Party Extensions
 
This is the most critical piece. Fortunately, it’s only one click. Toward the bottom-left of the extensions page is an option labeled “Allow extensions from other stores.” Toggle that option so it’s active. You’ll receive a pop-up warning that Microsoft hasn’t verified the extensions in the Chrome web store. That is okay. Just click “Allow” to move on.
 
## Adding Extensions
 
Head over to Google’s repository of Chrome extensions by clicking over to the Web Store. If for any reason that does not work, a simple Google or Bing search of “Google Chrome Extensions” will help navigate you to the right page.
 
Now just find any extension you want and install. Extensions that can be added will have a blue label toward the top right of the page labeled “Add to Chrome.” Just click on that and hit “Add extension” on the warning pop-up that follows. The confirmation dialog occurs with almost every install, so just continue to ignore its warnings. Hopefully, Microsoft will remove it after a while.
 
## Warning
 
Consider this your first warning: Google Chrome extensions have not been tested in the Edge environment. What this means is that you might see memory leaks or a variety of other breakages. If you experience problems, try and uninstall extensions one at a time until you find the cause.
 
## Uninstalling Chrome Extensions
 
As easy as it is to install, uninstalling Chrome extensions is equally simple. Head back to the “Extensions” tab. Installed extensions are broken down by Microsoft’s native selection and Chrome. To remove any extension, click “Remove,” and it will be gone.
 
## Conclusion
 
As Edge is likely to arrive as the default browser on Microsoft laptops in the future, there is a good chance it will see lots of market share. Knowing how to personalize and increase its functionality is important. Adding Chrome extensions makes an already good browser even better. Did the world need another Chromium browser? That’s a subject for another time, but in the interim, happy browsing!
