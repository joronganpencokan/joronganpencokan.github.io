Unlock the Secret to Conquering Every Boss in Hollow Knight with the Ultimate Boss Order Guide!

Hollow Knight is an immersive action game with mesmerizing visuals that can instantly engulf gamers into its world. The game's fascinating story follows a knight on the quest to explore and conquer the mysterious world of Hallownest. With breathtaking visuals and a memorable soundtrack, Hollow Knight has captured the attention of gamers worldwide. 

To progress through the game's story, players need to conquer a series of challenging bosses. If you're struggling to beat these bosses, fear not! We have a helpful guide to help you unlock the secret to conquering every boss in Hollow Knight.

1. Gruz Mother
Every journey begins with a single step, and in Hollow Knight, it starts with defeating the Gruz Mother. This boss is not too challenging, but it will teach you the basic mechanics of the game, such as dodging and attacking.

2. False Knight
The next boss on the list is the False Knight. This boss may look intimidating with its enormous size, but its moves are easily readable, and you can dodge them with ease. Just keep attacking its exposed head and avoid the rocks it throws your way.

3. Hornet
Hornet is a unique boss in that she won't try to kill you but instead will test your skills. After defeating her, you will gain an essential ability that will allow you to progress further in the game.

4. Gruz Mother (Rematch)
After obtaining the new ability, you can now go back and fight Gruz Mother again. This time around, she will have new moves and attacks, making the fight more challenging.

5. Soul Master
As you dive deeper into the game, enemies become more challenging, and so do the bosses. The Soul Master is no exception. This boss will require quick reflexes and precise movements to dodge its attacks.

6. Mantis Lords
The Mantis Lords are a thrilling boss fight that will test your combat skills. They have a good combination of speed and power, and you'll have to keep up with them to avoid being hit.

7. The Collector
The Collector is an optional boss, but defeating him will earn you an essential item that will make your journey much easier.

8. Dung Defender
The Dung Defender is a fun and robust boss that will test your movement and timing. His attacks may be funny, but don't let that fool you into thinking he's an easy boss.

9. Nosk
Nosk is a frightening boss that can shapeshift, making it challenging to predict its next move. Patience is key to avoiding its attacks and dealing damage.

10. Watcher Knights
The Watcher Knights are considered one of the game's most challenging bosses. This fight requires you to multitask and keep an eye on both knights simultaneously.

11. Traitor Lord
The Traitor Lord is a challenging boss that requires precise timing to dodge its attacks. You must be quick on your feet to avoid its relentless attacks to come out victorious.

12. Sisters of Battle
The Sisters of Battle are the final boss for the base game's main story. This fight will test all the skills you've learned throughout the game, so make sure to be fully prepared for this epic battle.

13. Hollow Knight
After defeating the Sisters of Battle, you can confront the Hollow Knight. This is the final boss of the game and has multiple forms, making it a challenging fight. You'll need all your skills to defeat it and complete your journey in Hallownest.

In conclusion, conquering all the bosses in Hollow Knight can be a daunting task, but with this boss order guide, you should be able to progress smoothly through the game. Remember to be patient and practice your timing and movement in each boss fight. Good luck, and may the best knight win!

Hollow Knight as a Metroidvania has no suggested linearity or path recommended by the devs to enjoy the game. But if you are looking to just complete a complete run efficiently, then there are lots of pathways suggested by fans from the player community. Today we will be looking at one of such suggested lists, which we here at GamerTweak used to get to one of the endings considered as a ‘good ending’ (5 years). And this list still works as I tried & tested it again for the purpose of this list. So with that said let’s look at our boss list for all Hollow Knight bosses in order.
 
## Hollow Knight Best Order For Bosses & List of Locations
 

 
We are not trying to do an any% speedrun with any glitches or cheats. So this path will still take time to enjoy most of the game has to offer in a single run. Still, we suggest you explore the rest of the areas in your next run. And to avoid spoilers (if this is your very first playthrough), we are not explaining what you achieve with each boss. Also if you are not exactly sure where to find these bosses, then use this Gamer Tweak article on Hollow Knight Interactive Map to find the exact location of these bosses using filers. With that said, here’s our Hollow Knight boss list with all bosses in order:
 
- Gruz Mother (Forgotten Crossroads)
 - False Knight (Forgotten Crossroads)
 - Vengefly King (Greenpath)
 - Hornet Protector (Greenpath)
 - Massive Moss Charger (Greenpath)
 - Mantis Lords (Mantis Village)

This list is based on the Zone order suggested by u/DiscordDraconequus in the game’s subreddit back in 2017. But this zone order still holds true and we have based our play order on it. You don’t have to beat all the bosses from each zone. We have selected only those bosses you need to beat to access a specific sub-area or to collect a new power to help you reach the final boss in the best way possible.
 
That’s all about our boss list for all Hollow Knight bosses in order. While you are here make sure to check out our Video Game Guides for tips & tricks on all the latest popular games tight here at GamerTweak.com.
