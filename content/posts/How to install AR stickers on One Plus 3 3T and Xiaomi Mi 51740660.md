AR Stickers were rolled out to Google Pixel devices a few days ago. With these stickers, a user could place 3D objects inside the camera’s viewfinder. They are fun to play with, but unfortunately, this update is exclusive to Google Pixel smartphones. However, that doesn’t mean it cannot be brought to other devices. With a little bit of tweaking, you can bring these stickers to rooted Nexus 6P. You can also enable it to run on other non-Google devices. Thanks to the Senior Member of XDA, Mrniva8G2 for this workaround. Here’s how to install AR stickers on OnePlus 3/3T and Xiaomi Mi 5.
 
## How to install AR stickers on One Plus 3/3T and Xiaomi Mi 5
 
Although I haven’t personally tested this yet, there is a video showing that it works perfectly on Xiaomi Mi 5. And, several users on XDA forums have reported that it works fine on One Plus 3 and 3T too. Follow the steps below to enable AR stickers on One Plus 3/3T and Xiaomi Mi 5;
 
- Download and install the ARCore and AR Stickers app. They will be marked incompatible in the Google Play Store.
 - Download calibration_cad.xml file here.
 - Install any root explorer from the Google Play Store. I recommend Solid Explorer as it is really easy and powerful to use.
 - Go to the folder where you’ve downloaded camibration_cad.xml file and move it to /system/etc.
 - Install BuildProp Editor from the Google Plays Store here.
 - Open the app and add the following line: ro.config.calibration_cad=/system/etc/calibration_cad.xml
 - Now, Install the modified Google Camera. Any will work fine.
 - Open the camera app and you’ll find AR Stickers on the menu.

 
Currently, only the Star Wars and Stranger Things AR sticker are available. Have fun playing with them. This method may work on other non-Google devices if you have the calibration_cad.xml file for that specific device. Search on the device’s XDA page to see if a developer has gotten it working on your device.
