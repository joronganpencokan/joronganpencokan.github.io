Unbelievable! Hitman 3's Florida Man Takes the Game by Storm – Here's How You Can Beat the Der Ami Challenge!

Hitman 3 has been taking the gaming world by storm. This latest installment of the Hitman series has been receiving rave reviews and is considered a must-play for fans of the franchise. One of the game's most exciting features is the introduction of the "Elusive Target" missions, which require players to take out a particular target within a designated time frame. The latest target, dubbed "Florida Man," has been causing a lot of buzz in the gaming world. Here is how you can beat the Der Ami challenge!

For those who may not know, the "Florida Man" moniker refers to a series of bizarre news stories that have been circulating for years. These stories often involve individuals from the state of Florida committing strange or outlandish acts, such as jumping into a swamp to avoid arrest, or assaulting someone with a live alligator.

In the Hitman 3 Elusive Target mission, players are tasked with taking out a character known only as "Der Ami," who fits the description of a typical "Florida Man." The twist? Unlike other Elusive Targets, Der Ami is aware that he is in danger, and is actively trying to evade the player. This means that players will need to use all of the skills they have acquired in the game to take him out.

To complete this mission, the player must enter a house that is occupied by Der Ami, blend in with the crowd of party-goers, and assassinate him without being detected. However, because Der Ami is aware of the player's presence, he will frequently change his location and behavior, making him much harder to track down.

There are several ways to overcome these challenges and successfully complete the mission. One method is to use distractions such as throwing objects to get Der Ami to investigate, and then using stealth to take him out. Another technique is to sneak into the house unnoticed and get a disguise that blends in with the other party-goers, allowing the player to get closer to Der Ami without being detected.

Players can also use the environment to their advantage. For example, there is a hot tub on the terrace that can be adjusted to a high temperature, and if Der Ami is lured into it, he will be killed instantly. Players can also use items such as propane tanks and gasoline to set traps for Der Ami, and then remotely ignite these traps to take him out.

Regardless of the method used, players need to exercise caution and be careful not to raise the alarm, as this will cause Der Ami to go into hiding, making it much harder to complete the mission. In addition, there are hidden challenges and achievements that can be unlocked by taking out Der Ami in creative and unique ways, so players are encouraged to experiment and think outside the box.

In conclusion, the "Florida Man" Elusive Target mission is one of the most challenging and exciting missions in Hitman 3. Players will need to use all of their skills and knowledge of the game to take out Der Ami and complete the mission. With some patience and creativity, anything is possible. Whether you're a fan of the Hitman series or a newcomer to the franchise, this mission is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. So what are you waiting for? Get out there and beat the Der Ami challenge!

The Florida man disguise has the same area access rights as the default starting suit in Berlin. But obtaining the disguise is essential to complete the discovery challenge Der Ami, and is part of 10 disguises in Chameleon Challenge Berlin. So let’s look at how to complete the Der Ami challenge by taking Hitman 3 Florida Man’s disguise.
 
## Who Is Florida Man in Hitman 3?
 
Nichola Velmorres aka “Florida Man” is first introduced in Hitman 2 as a food vendor from Miami. He has become a local celebrity by selling coconut balls at his very successful food stand. In Hitman 2, his disguise is an important part of The Munchies Mission Story. Using his disguise Agent 47 gets access to his food stand, which can be used to sever poisoned coconut balls to Robert Knox, your target Hitman 2’s second mission The Finish Line in Miami. So naturally, we were excited to see him return to Hitman 3, but this time in Berlin during the Apex Predator mission his disguise access privileges are pretty close to nothing.
 
## Where to Find Florida Man in Hitman 3?
 
Florida Man is inside the nightclub, and can be found near Projection Bar and mainly in Basement Bar of Level -2. But in Hitman 3 the Florida man disguise does not grant any special privileges, like extra access to any special areas like other disguises.
 
## How to Complete the Hitman 3 Der Ami Challenge?

 
To complete the Der Ami challenge, you have to put on the Florida Man disguise. You take on the Drug Dealer disguise, then approach Florida Man and talk to him.  Then he will follow you to any secluded area you want.

## How to Get Hitman 3 Florida Man Disguise?
 
You can easily recognize Florida Man. Like in Hitman 2, he wears very Zebra striped pants, a tank top with “NEU KLN” written on it, hoop earrings, gaudy sunglasses, and a fake ponytail attached to a skull cap. And yes he will be wearing his sunglasses inside the club too. You can easily find him using your instinct mode. Compared to normal NPCs He has a considerably wacky walk pattern and silhouette. He will be roaming around Basement Bar in Level -2 or else you can find him near Projection Bar.
 
To get Florida Man Disguise you need to bring him to a secluded area by making him follow you. You can use the Drug Dealer disguise and talk to Florida Man to make him follow you.
