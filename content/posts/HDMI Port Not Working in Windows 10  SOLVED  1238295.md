Fix HDMI Port Not Working in Windows 10: HDMI is a standard audio and video cabling interface used to transmit uncompressed video data as well as compressed and uncompressed audio data (digital) from HDMI supported source devices to a compatible computer monitor, televisions, and video projectors. Through these HDMI cables, users can connect various components such as a home theatre setup that includes TVs or projectors, disc players, media streamers, or even cable or satellite boxes. When there is an issue with the HDMI connection, then you can perform some troubleshooting by yourself to mend things, which will fix the issue in most of the cases.
 

 
Many computer users have reported problems regarding the HDMI port. Some common issues that users encountered most of the time are receiving no image, the sound coming out of the devices even when the cable is properly connected to the port, etc. Basically, the purpose of HDMI is to connect different components together easily through this generic HDMI connector where one cable is meant for both audio and video. Though, there is another additional HDMI function for implementing ‘copy protection’ (which is also termed as HDCP or HDCP 2.2 for 4K). This copy protection typically needs the HDMI connected components to be able to look for as well as communicate with each other. This feature of recognizing & then communicating is commonly termed as the HDMI handshake. In case the ‘handshake’ didn’t work well at any time, the HDCP encryption (embedded within the HDMI signal) becomes unrecognized by one, or more connected components. This often leads to when you cannot see anything on your TV screen.
