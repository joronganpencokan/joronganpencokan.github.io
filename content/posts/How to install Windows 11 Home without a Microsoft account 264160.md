You can install Windows 11 Home without a Microsoft account using a local account even though the official specifications say you can’t. You only need to know the workaround.
 
Typically, you want to use a Microsoft account to set up a clean installation of Windows 11 because it’s a more secure approach and offers integration with various cloud services and content syncing across devices. However, many people still prefer to use a local account despite all the benefits. Also, configuring a new installation without a Microsoft account allows you to create a more personalized profile folder name that won’t use part of the email address. In addition, if you plan to use remote access, starting with a local account will help avoid problems establishing the connection.
 
If you create a local account during the installation, you can always connect it later to a Microsoft account through the Accounts settings page.
 
This guide will teach you how to install Windows 11 Home with a local account for a more private and traditional experience. If you are setting up Windows 11 Pro, you can use these instructions instead.
 
## How to install Windows 11 Home with a local account
 
Windows 11 supports many ways of installation. These instructions will guide you to perform a clean installation using a bootable USB flash drive. However, since the option to create a local account is part of the out-of-box experience, the process will be the same.
 
If you choose this method, you also have to make sure the device can start from USB, which means you will have to change the BIOS or UEFI settings. Since these settings are different on most devices, refer to your manufacturer support website for more specific details.

 - Press any key to continue.
 - Click the Next button.
 - Click the Install now button.
 - Click the I don’t have a product key option if you are reinstalling. (If “Windows 11 Home” was activated after the installation, reactivation would happen automatically.)
 - Select the Windows 11 Home edition (if applicable).
 - Check the I accept the license terms option.
 - Click the Next button.
 - Select the Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) option.
 - Select each partition in the hard drive you want to install Windows 11 and click the Delete button. (Usually, the “Drive 0” is the drive that contains all the installation files.)
