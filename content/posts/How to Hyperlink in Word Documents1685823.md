In this article, we'll show you how to master the art of hyperlinking and take your Word document game to the next level.

To hyperlink in Word, you need to start by highlighting the text you want to link. This text can be a word, a phrase, or an entire sentence. Once you've highlighted your text, right-click on it, and select "Hyperlink" from the drop-down menu.

## Step 2: Choose where your hyperlink will lead

You can change the display text of the hyperlink (what users will see) and how it appears (for example, changing the color or underlining it). You can also add a screen tip that users will see when they hover over the hyperlink.

## Step 4: Test your hyperlink

Before finalizing your document, it's wise to test your hyperlinks to ensure they lead where you intended. Simply hover over the hyperlink and check that it leads to the correct destination.

When you choose this option, the hyperlink opens a website or file. For example, if you're writing an article about your camping trip to Rocky Mountain National Park, provide a hyperlink to the appropriate section of the National Park Service so readers can quickly find the information they need to plan a similar trip.

 

Another use might be if you wrote an article about the National Park Service and the document is available to your readers, link to the Word file you created. When the reader selects the hyperlink, that file opens.

 
##   Place in This Document Hyperlinks  
 

Another type of hyperlink jumps to a different place in the same document upon selection. Often called an anchor link, this type of link doesn't take the reader away from the document.

 

When a document is long and includes sections or chapters that are formatted as headings, create a table of contents at the beginning of the document. Include hyperlinks in the table of contents so that readers can jump to a particular heading.

 

You could also use this type of hyperlink at the end of each section to return to the top of the document.

After that, the hyperlink points to that document, exactly like the Existing File or Web Page option.

 

If you choose to make the document later, you're prompted to create the new document when you select the hyperlink after the hyperlink has been created. This type of hyperlink is useful if you want to link new content to the current document but don't want to create the new content yet. Instead, provide the hyperlink to it so you'll remember to work on the document later. When you do create the document, it will be linked in the main document.

 
##   Email Address Hyperlinks  
 

The last type of hyperlink you can make in Microsoft Word is one that points to an email address so that, when selected, the default email client opens and begins composing the message using the information from the hyperlink.

 

Choose a subject for the email and more than one email address that the message should be sent to. This information is pre-filled for readers when they select the hyperlink but they can change this information before they send the message.

 

This type of hyperlink is useful for situations when you want readers to contact you to set up a meeting or request additional information.
