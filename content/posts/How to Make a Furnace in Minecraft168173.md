# EASY STEPS to Build a Furnace in Minecraft – Become a MASTER SMITH in No Time!

Are you tired of being a clueless novice in Minecraft? Get ready to upgrade your skills and build a furnace! Furnaces are essential tools for mining, smelting, cooking and crafting in Minecraft.  In this article, we’ll show you how to build a furnace in just a few easy steps.

## Gather Resources

Before you can start building a furnace, you’ll need to gather some resources. Here’s what you’ll need:

- 8 cobblestone blocks
- 1 coal or charcoal

You can find cobblestone blocks by mining stone with a pickaxe in Minecraft. Coal can be found by mining coal ore or by killing some types of mobs.

## Crafting Your Furnace

Once you have gathered the resources, you can start crafting your furnace. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open your crafting table. (If you don’t have a crafting table, you can craft it by combining four wooden planks.)

2. Place your cobblestone blocks in a square formation in the crafting grid.

3. Put coal or charcoal in the top box.

4. Your furnace will appear on the right side of the screen.

Congratulations! You have just built a furnace in Minecraft. 

## Using Your Furnace 

To use your furnace, simply place it on the ground and right-click on it. A menu will appear with two slots:

1. The slot on the left is where you put the item you want to smelt or cook.

2. The slot on the right is where the finished product will appear.

To start the process, put your coal or charcoal in the bottom box and the item you want to smelt or cook in the top box. Then, wait for the process to complete. Depending on the item you want to smelt or cook, it may take between a few seconds to several minutes.

## Conclusion

Now that you have built your furnace in Minecraft, you can start reaping the benefits. With a furnace, you can smelt ores into ingots, cook food for sustenance, and craft items more efficiently. Follow these easy steps, and you will become a master smith in no time. Happy crafting!
