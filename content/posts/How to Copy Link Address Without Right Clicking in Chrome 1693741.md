# Unlock The Secret Shortcut: How To Copy Link Address With Just One Click In Chrome!

Are you tired of manually copying link addresses every time you find a page, image or video you want to share with someone else? If so, there is a simple and efficient way to copy link addresses with just one click in Google Chrome. 

In this article, we will show you the secret shortcut to copy link addresses in Chrome, along with a few useful tips to make the process even easier.

## The Secret Shortcut

The secret shortcut to copy link addresses in Chrome involves right-clicking on the link and selecting "Copy Link Address" from the drop-down menu. To do this, simply move your mouse over the link, right-click on it and select "Copy Link Address."

Alternatively, you can also use the keyboard combination of "Ctrl + Shift + C" to copy the link address. This is a faster and more convenient way to copy link addresses if you prefer using keyboard shortcuts.

## Customizing Your Chrome Experience

If you find yourself copying link addresses frequently, you can customize your Chrome experience by adding the "Copy Link Address" option to the toolbar menu. This will make it even easier to access this feature and save you time.

To do this, simply right-click on the toolbar, select "Customize Toolbar," and drag the "Copy Link Address" option to your desired location. This will add a button to your toolbar that you can click on to copy link addresses with just one click.

## Bonus Tips

Here are a few bonus tips to help streamline your link-copying process:

- Hold down the "Alt" key while right-clicking on a link to automatically copy the link address. This is a quick way to skip the drop-down menu and copy the link address directly.

- Use the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + Shift + T" to reopen a closed tab and automatically restore the link address you were on before it closed. This is useful if you accidentally close a tab and don't want to lose the link address.

- Install a Chrome extension like "Copy Link Text" or "Copy All Urls" to copy link addresses or multiple link addresses at once. This can save you even more time if you frequently share multiple links at once.

In conclusion, using the secret shortcut to copy link addresses in Chrome is a quick and efficient way to share links with others. With just one click or a simple keyboard shortcut, you can copy link addresses without any hassle or frustration. And by customizing your Chrome experience and using a few bonus tips, you can streamline this process even further.

Web surfing has become somewhat of a reflex for most Internet-savvy users, scanning through a lot of information on the web in a matter of minutes. There are dozens of apps and browser add-ons made every day to serve this purpose. Today there are thousands of tools that allow you to search, save and share information in the fastest way possible.
 
Adding to the long list of speed browsing tools is a Chrome extension called Copy Link Address. This extension makes copying and pasting website addresses quicker than usual. Rather than highlighting a URL and invoking the Copy command either from a keyboard shortcut or the context menu, Copy Link Address allows you to simply hover over a link and press “Ctrl + C” / “Cmd + C” to copy the address. You can then paste the link to the desired location as normal.
 
First, you’ll need to install the free extension from the Chrome Web Store.
 
Once installed, the extension is automatically activated. You may now copy and paste any link by hovering the mouse pointer and holding down “Ctrl + C” (Windows) or “Cmd + C” (Mac).
 
In the example below, I hovered the mouse pointer over the anchor text “What Is A Uniform Resource Locator,” then held down the hotkey “Ctrl + C”.
 
Opening a new tab, I pressed “Ctrl + V” to paste the link as shown in the screenshot below:
 
If you have a Mac, press “Cmd + v” again to paste the copied link address.
 
The extension is mostly limited to this function, so it’s lightweight and will not slow down your browser in any way. You can paste a copied URL to any text box, text editor or notepad file.
 
Once you’ve pasted the copied link, you cannot paste it to another location again. You would need to go back and copy from the source to be able to duplicate the process (unless you are using a clipboard manager).
 
There is no indicator to show if the copying action was successful or not, and although this makes the extension less distracting, it also leaves a user wondering whether the key stroke worked or not unless he executes the Paste command.
 
The extension might not let you copy all types of URLs, specifically those that link to files. To enable this feature, go to “Chrome Settings -> Extensions.” Under Copy Link Address, check the box beside “Allow access to file URLs.”
 
Copy Link Address’s function is highly focused on a faster way to copy and paste URLs, so it’s not an all-around solution for other browsing needs. There is nothing else this extension does, and this is a good thing if you’re looking for a simple, uncomplicated solution.
 
With this extension, you never have to access the context menu (right-click) again and should have the convenience of copying and pasting URLs all from keyboard shortcuts. Once you get the hang of it, you will see how a small thing like not clicking the right-click button makes such a big difference – in a good way. If you prefer using the keyboard, Copy Link Address is a small yet powerful extension that will make web browsing easier for you.
