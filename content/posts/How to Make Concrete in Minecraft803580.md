Step 5 - Collect Concrete Block
Congratulations! You have created concrete! Break the block with any pickaxe and collect it. You can now use it to add a pop of color to your builds. It's also excellent for creating outdoor structures such as fountains, pools, or gardens.

Knowing how to make Concrete in Minecraft can come in handy because it's one of the most durable and versatile blocks in the game. Concrete blocks come in different colors and cannot be set on fire.

 
##   How to Get Concrete in Minecraft  
 

Concrete doesn't occur naturally, so you must make it on your own. First, craft some Concrete Powder, then use it on a water block to create a Concrete block. Then, equip a pickaxe and mine the block to get your Concrete.

 
These instructions apply to Minecraft on all platforms.
 

To make multiple Concrete blocks, stack Concrete Powder blocks on top of one another. When you mine the Concrete with your pickaxe, the Concrete Power blocks will fall, and the bottom one will become Concrete. Keep mining the bottom block to collect as much Concrete as you need.

 
##   Required Materials for Concrete  
 

You need the following items to craft Concrete Power:

 
- 4 Gravel4 Sand1 Dye (any color)

 

To turn Concrete Power into Concrete, all you need is a water source and a pickaxe to mine it with.

To craft Concrete Powder, combine 4 Sand, 4 Gravel, and 1 Dye in a Crafting Table. It doesn't matter how you arrange the materials.
