Unleash Chaos in Dubai! Discover the Secret to Triggering an Evacuation and Score the Evacuation Key in Hitman 3!

Hitman 3 is a game filled with thrilling missions and the Dubai mission is no exception. The biggest skyscraper in the world awaits Agent 47 as he takes on a challenging mission in Dubai. With multiple targets and a grand location, the Dubai mission is undoubtedly one of the most daunting tasks you will come across in the game.

To tackle this mission, you need to be smart and strategic. One of the best ways to do this is by unleashing chaos in Dubai, and in this article, you will discover the secret to doing just that.

Triggering an Evacuation

As you make your way through the skyscraper, you will come across many people, including security personnel and guards. In order to unleash chaos, you need to find and interact with specific items, which will cause an evacuation.

The first item you need to find is the fire alarm. This will cause a panic among the people, and they will start rushing towards the exits. However, this is just the start. You need to create more chaos and panic to divert the attention of the guards and security personnel.

The second item you need to interact with is the gas valve. This will cause a gas leak, which will result in the air becoming toxic. This will cause an additional panic among the people, and they will start to move even faster towards the exits.

Once you have triggered the fire alarm and gas valve, it's time to find and activate the evacuation switch. This switch is located in the security room, which is guarded by multiple personnel. You can either take them out or distract them with a thrown object or a well-placed explosion.

Scoring the Evacuation Key

Once you have successfully triggered the evacuation, you will have the chance to get your hands on the evacuation key. This is a critical item as it allows you to access a locked room that contains valuable items and gives you an alternate exit.

To obtain the evacuation key, you need to make your way to the penthouse. Here, you will find a keycard that allows you to access the penthouse suite. Make your way through the suite and take out the guards until you find the safe that contains the evacuation key.

Once you have obtained the key, you will have access to the locked room. Here, you will find valuable items, including a high-tech drone that can help you complete your mission.

Conclusion

Unleashing chaos in Dubai is not an easy task, but it's one of the best ways to complete the mission with ease. By triggering an evacuation and scoring the evacuation key, you can create distractions that help you complete your mission without raising any suspicion. So, the next time you take on the Dubai mission in Hitman 3, don't be afraid to unleash chaos and score big!
