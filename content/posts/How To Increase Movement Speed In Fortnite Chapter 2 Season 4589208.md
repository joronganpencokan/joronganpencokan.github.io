In this article, we'll take a look at some tips and tricks that will help you master this new feature and dominate the competition.

### Tip #1: Collect Speed Boost Power-ups

The first way to get a speed boost in Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 4 is to collect power-ups. These power-ups come in different forms and can be found scattered across the map. Here are some of the most common ones:

- Hot Peppers: These spicy vegetables will give you a temporary speed boost and make you immune to storm damage.

- Hop Rocks: These glowing rocks will let you jump higher and move faster for a limited time.

- Rifts: These interdimensional portals will transport you instantly to another location, allowing you to cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time.

To make the most of these power-ups, you need to be strategic in your approach. Plan your route carefully, keep an eye out for hotspots, and try to gather as many power-ups as you can before engaging in combat.

### Tip #2: Build a Custom Loadout

Another way to unlock the ultimate speed boost in Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 4 is to build a custom loadout. This means choosing weapons and equipment that will support your speed-focused playstyle. Here are some items that you might want to consider:

- Launch Pads: These can be used to launch yourself into the air and glide across the map.

- Grappling Hook: This will let you zip across gaps and climb up walls quickly.

- Shadow Bombs: These will give you temporary invisibility and let you run faster than your opponents.

Choose your loadout carefully, based on your playstyle and the situation at hand. You don't want to be weighed down by unnecessary gear, but you also don't want to be caught off guard without the tools you need to move quickly.

### Tip #3: Master Building Techniques

Finally, to truly unlock the ultimate speed boost in Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 4, you need to master building techniques. Building is a crucial part of the game, and it can be used to gain an advantage in many ways. Here are some building techniques that will help you move quickly:

- Wall Running: Build a wall, run along it, and jump off to move quickly.

- Stair Boosting: Build a set of stairs, jump off them, and then use your glider to coast across the map.

These building techniques take practice to master, but once you do, you'll be able to move across the map quickly and efficiently, giving you a major advantage over your opponents.
