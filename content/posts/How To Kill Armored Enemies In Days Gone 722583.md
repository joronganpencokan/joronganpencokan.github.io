Unlock the Secret to Taking Down Armored Enemies like a Pro in Days Gone - You Won't Believe How Easy It Is!

Days Gone is an action-adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world infested with zombies, which can prove to be quite challenging at times. However, one of the most challenging aspects of the game is taking down armored enemies, which require a considerable amount of firepower to defeat. But fear not, as we uncover the secret to taking down armored enemies like a pro in Days Gone, which is surprisingly easy.

Before we begin, it is essential to note that it is not advisable to take on armored enemies until you are well-equipped and have enough resources to do so.

That being said, the secret to taking down armored enemies involves two factors: explosives and weak points. Armored enemies have weak spots that you can exploit to take them down more efficiently. These weak points include their heads, which can be revealed by hitting them with explosives. Explosives such as grenades or Molotov cocktails are the perfect tools to reveal these weak points.

After you've hit the armored enemy with an explosive, you should move closer and shoot them in the head. Shooting them in the head deals more damage and can be especially effective if you're using a sniper rifle. If you're low on ammo, you can use a melee weapon such as a baseball bat to hit them in their weak spot (usually the head), which will also deal considerable damage.

It's essential to note that not all enemies have the same weak spot. Some armored enemies have weak spots on their arms, legs, or even on their backs. Therefore, hitting them with an explosive may not always reveal their weak spot.

Another essential factor to take into account when taking down armored enemies is your position. It's important to position yourself in a place where you have a clear line of sight of the enemy's weak spot. This means you should always try to get behind the enemy or get them to turn around so that their weak spot is exposed.

In conclusion, taking down armored enemies in Days Gone can be challenging, but it doesn't have to be. By using explosives and hitting their weak spots, you can take them down more efficiently. Remember to position yourself correctly and take advantage of their weak points by hitting them in their heads or other vulnerable areas. With these tips, you'll be taking down armored enemies like a pro in no time.

When you encounter an armored enemy, you will need to shoot at a specific spot in order to destroy the piece of armor first and then damage your opponent. this usually means shooting at the head of enemies with your first couple of shots damaging and removing any headgear they have and then the next couple of shots to make sure the enemy is dead.
 
Explosives like grenades and molotovs do not inflict much damage onto enemies, explosives do not instantly kill armored enemies and you will have to re-attack them to make sure they are down.
 
Enemies with heavy armor cannot be killed with stealth attacks as the armor they have on prevents Deacon from launching into a sneak attack without raising alarm, instead, you will have to go all guns blazing at them.
