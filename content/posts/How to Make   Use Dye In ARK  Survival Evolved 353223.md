Unleash Your Inner Artist in Ark Survival Evolved with This Incredible Dye Tutorial - 10 Mind-Blowing Techniques Revealed!

Ark Survival Evolved is a popular survival game that has captivated gamers for years. From taming dinosaurs to building structures, there's no end to the entertainment that the game provides. However, what sets Ark Survival Evolved apart from other survival games is its unique crafting system that allows you to create your own dyes.

If you're tired of the boring default colors that the game provides, then this incredible dye tutorial will help unleash your inner artist. In this guide, we'll reveal 10 mind-blowing dye techniques that you can use to create stunning designs and patterns.

1. The Gradient Technique
The gradient technique involves applying one color over another, creating a smooth transition between the two colors. To achieve this effect, you'll need to apply the lighter color first and then add the darker color over it gradually.

2. The Ombre Technique
The Ombre technique is similar to the gradient technique, but instead of creating a smooth transition, it creates a distinct color change. To achieve the ombre effect, you'll need to apply a base color and then gradually add small amounts of a different color until the desired effect is achieved.

3. The Dip-Dye Technique
The Dip-Dye technique is a fun and easy method that involves dipping a small portion of an object into a dye bath. This technique is perfect for creating multiple colors on one object.

4. The Splatter Technique
The splatter technique involves flicking small amounts of dye onto an object using a brush or a spray bottle. This technique is perfect for creating a unique, abstract pattern.

5. The Stamp Technique
The stamp technique involves using a stamp to create a pattern on an object. You can use a variety of stamps, from pre-made stamps to custom-made ones that you carve yourself.

6. The Tie-Dye Technique
The tie-dye technique is a classic technique that involves twisting, folding, and tying an object before adding dye. This technique is perfect for creating interesting patterns and designs.

7. The Stencil Technique
The stencil technique involves using a stencil to create a pattern or design on an object. You can use pre-made stencils or create your own stencils using paper or cardboard.

8. The Brush Technique
The brush technique involves using a brush to apply the dye directly onto an object. You can use different brush strokes to create interesting patterns and designs.

9. The Sponge Technique
The sponge technique involves using a sponge to apply dye onto an object. This technique is perfect for creating a soft, mottled effect on your objects.

10. The Spray Technique
The spray technique involves using a spray bottle to apply dye onto an object. You can use different nozzles to create various effects, from a fine mist to a splatter effect.

In conclusion, there are many creative and exciting dye techniques that can be employed to bring your ark survival evolved experience to life. Using these techniques, your inner artist can truly shine, making your base and structures irresistible to other players. By including these techniques in your game plan, you'll take your game to the next level and provide yourself with hours upon hours of fun, crafting and designing your perfect Ark world.

The world in ARK: Survival Evolved can sometimes be a bit drab. Using dye, you can customize a ton of stuff in the game. This includes living creatures like yourself other than the items in the game. There are 25 different colored dyes that you can use in the game. These dyes allow you to make the ARK world a cooler place to be in.  If you are looking to make your own dye in ARK: Survival Evolved then this is the guide for you.
 
## How to Make Dye in ARK: Survival Evolved
 

 
You can only make dye by using a Cooking Pot or Industrial Cooker in the game. Apart from these, you will need the following:
 
- 1x water jar, waterskin or canteen.

 
All of these must be filled 25% or more. Otherwise, they must be connected to a water source within the Industrial Cooker.
 
- 2x charcoal, 1x gunpowder, or 1x sparkpowder

 
After you have collected these, you will need a specific number of berries based on the color that you want to create the dye with.
 
Once you do this, you can start cooking your dyes on a lit fire. Every batch makes five dyes that you can use.

After you make your dye, you will want to use the same on your items. Here is a list of items that you can use dye on:
 
- Armor
 - Saddles
 - Creatures
 - Weapons
 - Buildings
 - Structures
 - Miscellaneous Items

 
To color your items, you will need to use a paintbrush or spray painter. You can get the paintbrush when you reach level nine and can be used to color anything. While spray painting will require more to craft, but it is worth it as it’ll be quicker to paint with in the game. The only thing that you won’t be able to do with it is to use the spray painter as warpaint on your creatures and yourself.
 
Next, follow these steps:
 
- Drag the dye onto the item that you want to color
 - Now, use the attack button to begin painting the object

 
If you’re too rough with the object and it breaks then you can always use the repair button. This will drag another dye onto the item to fix it.
