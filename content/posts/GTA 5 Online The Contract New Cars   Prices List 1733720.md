Introduction

GTA 5 Online is a platform where players can explore the city, complete missions, and engage in races using virtually any vehicle possible. Cars are a hot commodity in the game, and players are always on the lookout for new and exciting rides. However, purchasing a car in this game can be costly. In this article, we'll provide an ultimate guide to The Contract's insane new car prices in GTA 5 Online.

Body

The Contract is one of the latest DLC updates that offer many new and exciting vehicles in the game. This update has brought a whole new set of cars that are both sophisticated and stylish. However, purchasing these vehicles may leave a hole in your virtual wallet. Here are some of the cars available in The Contract and the prices you can expect to pay for them.

1. Emperor Vectre ($2,095,000)

Presenting a sophisticated design, the Emperor Vectre may seem like an army tank that escaped from the military base. It's a combination of a sports car, SUV, and armored vehicle. If you're looking to cruise through the city while staying safe from any potential attacks, the Emperor Vectre is an excellent option.

2. Dinka Invasion ($2,305,000)

The Dinka Invasion is a futuristic vehicle that can accommodate up to six people. This car is designed for a whole team to ride in, and the design makes it appear like it's from another planet. If you're looking to travel in a car that's out of this world, literally or figuratively, the Dinka Invasion is the car for you.

3. HVY Barrage ($2,728,000)

The HVY Barrage is a military-style off-road vehicle that can take you into terrains that your average car would find impossible to navigate. While the car is not as fast as some of the sports cars, it makes up for this with its durability and strength. If you need to chase down other players or vehicles or make a quick escape through the rough terrain, you should consider getting this car.

4. Ocelot Ardent C160 ($1,955,000)

The Ocelot Ardent C160 is a vehicle that has been around since the game's inception. However, with The Contract update, it's received a facelift that's turned it into an even cooler ride. Its design has been modeled after a classic 60's car, and it is loaded with hidden weapons. It's not an ideal car for navigating difficult terrains, but with its armaments, it can help you take out someone else's car in a gunfight.

Conclusion

Playing GTA 5 Online is exhilarating, and purchasing new cars is one of the best ways to customize your character's progress. However, it's expensive, and not everyone can afford to buy all the new cars. In this article, we have discussed the ultimate guide to The Contract's insane new car prices in GTA 5 Online, showcasing some of the cars available for purchase and their respective cost. Now that you have all the information, you can make informed decisions on what to buy and how much to save to get your dream car.
