Unleash the Ultimate Sword in The Witcher 3: Discover How to Obtain Aerondight Now!

The Witcher 3 is one of the most celebrated RPGs of all time, thanks to its immersive storyline, incredible world-building, and challenging gameplay. One of the most sought-after weapons in the game is the legendary Aerondight, a sword that is said to be the ultimate weapon for any Witcher. In this article, we will take a closer look at Aerondight and guide you on how to obtain this powerful sword.

What is Aerondight?

Aerondight is a silver sword that is wielded by the legendary hero, Lancelot du Lac. According to legend, the sword was forged using the power of the Lady of the Lake, the same being who gave the legendary wizard Merlin his power. Aerondight is said to be indestructible and possesses the power to slay any enemy with a single blow.

In The Witcher 3, Aerondight is a powerful silver sword that deals massive damage to undead creatures, including wraiths and vampires. The sword also has a unique ability that allows it to gain power as you defeat more foes. The more enemies you slay with Aerondight, the stronger the sword becomes.

How to obtain Aerondight?

To obtain Aerondight, you need to complete a series of quests in the Blood and Wine expansion. The questline is called "There Can Be Only One" and is started by speaking to the Hermit in the Lake of Nine. The questline is divided into five parts, each of which has different requirements.

Part 1: The Hermit

Speak to the Hermit and complete his challenges. The challenges include solving puzzles and fighting monsters. Once you complete all the challenges, the Hermit will give you the sword.

Part 2: Five Chivalric Virtues

Aerondight is a sword that can only be wielded by those who are pure of heart. To prove your purity, you must complete a series of tasks that test your chivalry. These tasks include saving a damsel in distress, defeating a group of bandits without killing them, and helping a knight in shining armor. Once you complete all five tasks, return to the Hermit to get the next quest.

Part 3: The Ghosts of the Past

In this quest, you must defeat five ghostly knights. These knights are different from any enemy you have faced before, as they come with unique abilities and are immune to most damage. You must defeat them using your wits and skill.

Part 4: The Encounter

In this quest, you will encounter the Lady of the Lake. You will need to answer her questions and make a choice that will determine the fate of Aerondight.

Part 5: The Ultimate Sword

After completing all the previous quests, return to the Hermit to receive the ultimate version of Aerondight. The sword is now at its strongest and can deal massive damage to any undead enemies.

Conclusion

Aerondight is one of the most powerful swords in The Witcher 3. It requires skill, dedication, and a pure heart to obtain. But once you have it, you can unleash its power and slay any undead creatures that cross your path. So, sharpen your blades, prepare for battle, and embark on the quest to obtain Aerondight – the ultimate sword!
