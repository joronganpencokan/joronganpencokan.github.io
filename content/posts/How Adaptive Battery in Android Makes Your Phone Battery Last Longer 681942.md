# Discover the Secret Trick to Extending Your Android Phone Battery Life - Thanks to this Game-Changing Feature!

Are you tired of constantly charging your Android phone throughout the day? Do you wish you could use your device for longer periods without needing a recharge? Well, you're in luck because we have discovered a secret trick that can help extend your Android phone battery life significantly.

Thanks to a game-changing feature in the latest Android operating system update, you can now reduce your phone's battery consumption by up to 20%. This feature is called **Adaptive Battery**, and it works by learning how you use your phone daily and prioritizing power for the apps you use the most.

Here's how this game-changing feature works:

### What is Adaptive Battery?

Adaptive Battery is a feature that uses artificial intelligence to learn your daily phone usage patterns and prioritize power consumption accordingly. The more you use your phone, the more it learns about your habits and determines which apps you use the most. It then allocates battery power to those apps and restricts power usage for apps that you rarely use.

### How to Enable Adaptive Battery

To enable Adaptive Battery on your Android device, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings** on your Android device.
2. Scroll down and tap on **Battery**.
3. Tap on the **three dots** icon in the top right corner of the screen.
4. Select **Battery usage**.
5. Tap on **Adaptive Battery**.
6. Toggle the switch to turn it on.

Once you have enabled Adaptive Battery, your phone will begin to learn your usage habits and prioritize power consumption accordingly.

### More Tips to Save Battery Life

While Adaptive Battery is an effective way to extend your Android phone battery life, there are other things you can do to save battery power as well. Here are a few tips:

1. **Reduce Screen Brightness** - This may seem obvious, but lowering your screen brightness can significantly reduce battery consumption.

2. **Close Unused Apps** - Make sure to close any apps you're not actively using to conserve battery power.

3. **Turn on Battery Saver Mode** - Most Android phones have a built-in Battery Saver Mode that can help extend battery life even further. To enable this feature, go to Settings > Battery > Battery Saver.

4. **Disable Location Services** - Location services can be a major battery drain, especially if you have several apps using this feature. Consider disabling this feature to conserve battery power.

In conclusion, Adaptive Battery is a game-changing feature that can help you extend your Android phone battery life significantly. By learning your usage habits and prioritizing power consumption, this feature can reduce your battery consumption by up to 20%. If you're struggling with battery life on your Android phone, be sure to enable Adaptive Battery and follow these other tips to save power.

Adaptive Battery in Android Pie does something that Android users need: saves battery life. With a few adjustments, you’ll see your device’s battery last longer.
 
It will take some time for the feature to work at its best, but once it does, you’ll see that it was worth the wait. Let’s see how you can take full advantage of this battery-saving feature.
 
## What Is Adaptive Battery?
 
Adaptive Battery is a battery-saving feature introduced in Android 9 that uses Alphabet’s DeepMind AI technology. Adaptive Battery is the result of Android and DeepMind teaming up.
 
The feature aims to predict the app you’re going to use and only allow those frequently-used apps to run in the background. The apps you rarely or never use will have a strict level of restrictions to help you save battery life.
 
The Adaptive Battery feature improves over time, as it learns how often you use your apps. When the feature has picked up how often you use your apps, it will place them in App Standby Buckets. These buckets are Active, Working Set, Frequent, Rare, and Never.
 
## Adaptive Battery Buckets
 
When an app is in the Active Bucket, no restrictions apply. It can use the resources it needs to give you the best user experience. These are apps you open by tapping on a notification or open manually.
 
The Working_Set bucket is for apps you usually use but that you’re not using at that moment. The apps in this category only suffer mild restrictions. Apps you use indirectly can also fall into this category.
 
An app can be called Frequent if you (just like the name states) use it frequently but not daily. Apps in this category will have stronger restrictions when it comes to alarms and runs tasks.
 
The Rare Bucket speaks for itself. Here, you’ll find apps you only use every once in a while. Any app that is considered rare will have stern restrictions. For example, it will experience limitations when it comes to getting high-priority FCM messages, run tasks, and alarms.
 
If an app is in the Rare bucket, there is a good chance you forgot you even installed the app. These kinds of apps have rigorous restrictions.
 
Adaptive Battery could depend on an integrated app that also uses machine learning to decide how often you will use specific apps. If your device lacks this app, then it will monitor how often you use apps to determine what bucket they go into. But it will take some time for it to work at its best.
 
The bucket they are in will also determine how often the app can run tasks such as alarms and accept high-priority Firebase Cloud Messaging. When your device is charging, no restrictions are applied to the apps.
 
The apps that are placed in a bucket won’t be there forever. If how often you use an app changes, the bucket its placed in will also change.
 
## How to Turn on Adaptive Battery in Android Pie
 
The Adaptive Battery feature should be on by default, but if you want to check that it’s on, go to “Settings -> Battery -> Adaptive Battery.”
 
It’s also possible to see what apps have fallen into a specific bucket. To see this, you’ll need to unlock Developer Options in Android Pie. 
 
After seeing a note that you’re now a developer, go back a few times, and the Developer options should currently be listed. Open “Developer options -> select Standby apps,” and tap on the app you’re interested in.
 
## Conclusion
 
Adaptive Battery is a step in the right direction. Thanks to this feature, you’ll be saving a good amount of battery life. What are your thoughts on the feature?
 
Just a simple guy that can't enough of Technology in general and is always surrounded by at least one Android and iOS device. I'm a Pizza addict as well.
