Are you one of the millions of people who wear a Fitbit or other wearable device to track your activity and monitor your health? If so, you may be surprised to learn that these devices are not always accurate, and may even be lying to you about your health and fitness levels.

Recent studies have shown that many popular fitness trackers, including Fitbit, overestimate the number of calories burned during exercise and underestimate the amount of sleep you're getting. Some studies have even found that these devices can be off by as much as 20-30% in their calorie tracking.

So, what's behind these inaccuracies? There are several factors that come into play.

First, most fitness trackers use algorithms to estimate calorie burn based on your height, weight, and age, along with data from the device's sensors. However, these algorithms are not always accurate, and can be influenced by factors such as exercise intensity, body composition, and individual differences in metabolism.

Additionally, wearables like Fitbit rely heavily on sensors that track movement and heart rate. However, these sensors can be easily disrupted by factors like sweat, movement, and even tattoos. This can lead to inaccurate tracking of exercise intensity and calorie burn.

Finally, factors like sleep quality and duration can be difficult for wearables to accurately track. Many devices rely solely on movement tracking to determine sleep patterns, which can be affected by factors like sleeping position, environmental noise, and interruptions from pets or children.

So, what should you do if you're concerned about the accuracy of your Fitbit or other wearable device? First, keep in mind that these devices can still be helpful in providing general guidance on health and fitness. They may not be completely accurate, but they can still give you a general idea of your activity levels and help you stay motivated.

However, it's important to be aware of the limitations of these devices, and to use them in combination with other methods of tracking your health and fitness. Consider consulting with a personal trainer or nutritionist to help you set realistic goals and develop a well-rounded approach to your health and fitness.

Ultimately, it's up to you to decide how much weight to give to the information provided by your Fitbit or other wearable device. While they can be helpful tools in monitoring your health and fitness, they are not infallible. By understanding the limitations and potential inaccuracies of these devices, you can make informed decisions about how to use them in your overall health and fitness journey.

Fitbit is the world's most popular activity tracker, calculating your daily activity while motivating you to move throughout the day. But how accurate is a Fitbit? Learn how Fitbit calculates your steps and how well it keeps tabs on steps taken, calories burned, and sleep.

 
##   How Does Fitbit Work to Track Your Steps?  
 

Fitbit uses an accelerometer with three axes that can detect movements in any direction. When worn on the body, a proprietary algorithm that looks for specific movement patterns analyzes the data captured by the Fitbit's accelerometer.

 

Together, the data from the accelerometer and the counting algorithm determine the number of steps taken, the distance covered, the energy spent, the intensity of exercise, and sleep.

 
##   How Accurate Is Fitbit?  
 

Experts consider Fitbits surprisingly accurate, but they're not perfect. Because movement is subject to different factors, they're known to undercount or overcount steps at times. Walking on a plush carpet or pushing a shopping cart or stroller may cause Fitbit to undercount steps. Driving down a bumpy road or riding a bike may cause it to overcount steps.

 

According to a study on Fitbit accuracy published by the NCBI, researchers found that Fitbit devices were “acceptably accurate” for step counting about 50% of the time. Additionally, they found that accuracy increased depending on where the device is worn:

 
- For jogging, wrist placement was the most accurate.For normal-paced walking, wearing the Fitbit on the torso provides the most accurate measurements.For slow or very slow walking, placing it on the ankle provided the best accuracy.

 

Meanwhile, Fitbits aren't great at calculating energy expenditure (i.e., calories burned and workout intensity). They tend to overestimate higher-intensity activities while underestimating distance traveled with fast walking. But for sleep tracking, Fitbit devices were on par with research-grade accelerometers—in other words, accurate.

 
##   How to Increase the Accuracy of Your Fitbit  
 

If you're concerned your Fitbit isn't tracking your activity correctly, or you want to ensure the most accurate results, here are the steps you can take to help increase the accuracy of your Fitbit.

 
Based on a 2017 study, the Fitbit Surge was significantly more accurate in counting calories than the Apple Watch, Basis Peak, Microsoft Band, Mio Alpha 2, PulseOn, and Samsung Gear S2.
 
###   Wear Your Device Correctly  
 

Where and how you wear your Fitbit can impact accuracy. In general, the device should remain in close contact with your body when you're exercising (and not dangling from a necklace, backpack, or loose clothing).

 

Here's what Fitbit recommends:

 
- For wrist-based Fitbits: Wear your Fitbit watch on top of your wrist, not too tight or too loose. For devices that track heart rate, make sure it's touching your skin, and wear it a bit tighter on your wrist when working out.For clip-based Fitbits: Wear the Fitbit close to your body with the screen facing outward. Secure the clip tightly to any part of your clothing. Experiment with different locations to see what works best for you (more secure is better).

 
###   Change Your App Settings  
 

Fitbit relies on the information you provide in the app to calculate your steps and daily activity accurately.

 

Make sure the following settings are set up correctly in the app. These options are on the dashboard, either under Device Settings or Personal Information.

 
- Wrist orientation: By default, Fitbit is set to your left hand, i.e., most people's non-dominant hand. If you're wearing it on your right hand, update this setting to Right.
 - Height: Fitbit uses height to estimate your walking and running stride lengths. Enter your correct height in inches or centimeters to ensure the most accurate step count.
 - Stride Length: Fitbit uses a default stride setting based on your height. For greater accuracy, change this and manually enter your stride length. See How Does Fitbit Track Steps to learn how to do this.
 - Exercise App: To better measure workout intensity, use Fitbit's exercise app (particular models only) to track your workouts, especially for activities like spinning or yoga. The app has Android, iOS, and Windows versions.
 - Use the GPS: If you're not swinging your arms when walking (for example, when pushing a stroller), you can use Fitbit's GPS feature to calculate your daily activity better (specific models only).

 
###   Change Where You Wear Your Fitbit  
 

Based on the research, you can potentially increase your Fitbit's accuracy by changing the location of where you wear your Fitbit during certain activities.

 
- When walking at an average pace, wear the Fitbit on your torso (clip models).When walking slowly, wear the Fitbit on your ankle (clip models).When jogging, wear the Fitbit on your wrist (wrist models).When sleeping, Fitbit suggests wearing a classic wristband (wrist models).

 

Generally speaking, you shouldn't sweat your Fitbit's accuracy too much. A Fitbit is accurate enough for non-medical uses. so being off a few steps or calories won't noticeably affect your device's use and enjoyment.
