Rocket Arena is an action-packed game that offers an exciting gaming experience. The game involves players engaging in explosive battles, utilizing a range of fun and unpredictable weapons. However, one of the key areas that can set players ahead of the competition is through the proper use of artifacts. Artifacts are powerful items you can use in the game that can give you an edge over your opponents. In this expert guide, we will discuss how you can unleash the power of artifacts in Rocket Arena and find them easily.

### What are Artifacts?

Firstly, let's start by defining artifacts. Artifacts are powerful items that players can use in the game, which grant special abilities to players when equipped. There are seven different artifacts available in Rocket Arena, each offering different abilities.

1. Ghost Hat - makes the player invisible for a few seconds.

2. Time Bomb - throws a bomb that detonates after a short delay.

3. Frostbite - creates an ice shield around the player that harms enemies within its radius.

4. Rocket Magnet - attracts rockets towards the player to deter enemy shots.

5. Gravity Orb - creates a gravity field that pulls in enemy players within its radius.

6. Lifesteal - restores some of the player's health with every hit.

7. Mega Rocket - increases the size of a player's rocket.

These artifacts can be found throughout the game and can add a significant advantage to your gameplay when used strategically.

### How to Find Artifacts in Rocket Arena

The maps in Rocket Arena have several areas that spawn artifacts. There are some key places you need to look if you want to find these power-ups. Here are some tips to find them easily:

1. Check Corner Areas: Artifacts are usually found in corners of the map where there is a dead end or an area that seems out of place. These areas will typically have an artifact spawn on them periodically.

2. Keep an eye out for your opponent: When an opponent uses an artifact, they will typically leave some residual effects behind them. Follow these effects back to their source to find where the artifact is located.

3. Watch for Timers: Artifacts spawn on a timer. Keep a close eye on the timer to know when and where they will spawn.

4. Use Your Rocket: Launching yourself to higher elevations on the map will provide a better vantage point and allow you to spot artifacts from a distance.

### Unleashing the Power of Artifacts

Using artifacts wisely can be the difference between victory and defeat in Rocket Arena. Here are some tips on using the artifacts properly:

1. Know Your Artifact: The first step to unleashing the power of artifacts is to understand how they work. Every artifact has different strengths and weaknesses, and knowing them can help you use them to your advantage.

2. Timing is everything: Use the artifact wisely and strategically. For example, using a Ghost Hat right before you are about to engage in a firefight can be a game-changer, as it will allow you to quickly change your position and get an advantage over your opponent.

3. Take Advantage of the Element of Surprise: Using an artifact without warning can give you an instant advantage over your opponents. For example, using a Time Bomb can take out opponents who are not prepared for the explosion.

4. Stay Alert: While the artifact is active, don't let your guard down. Your opponents will try to take advantage of your momentary power and will try their best to take you out.

In conclusion, using artifacts in Rocket Arena can be a game-changer, especially if you know how to locate and use them to your advantage. By keeping an eye out for their location, understanding how they work, and using them at the perfect time, you will unleash their true power and wreak havoc on the battlefield!
