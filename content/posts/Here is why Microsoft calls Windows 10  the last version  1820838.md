Title: You Won't Believe Why Microsoft is Ditching Future Versions of Windows...Find Out Now!

Introduction:
The tech giant Microsoft is known for its innovative products and software that have revolutionized the world of technology. Windows, their operating system, has become synonymous with personal computing since its inception in the 80s. However, in a surprising move, Microsoft announced in 2015 that Windows 10 would be the last version of Windows they would release. This decision raised many eyebrows in the tech world, leaving everyone wondering - Why is Microsoft ditching future versions of Windows? Find out now!

Body:

1. Windows 10 is constantly updated:
One of the primary reasons cited by Microsoft for discontinuing future Windows versions is that Windows 10 will be constantly updated. Unlike the previous versions of Windows, Windows 10 will receive regular feature updates and security patches, ensuring it remains fresh and secure. This approach also allows Microsoft to gather feedback from users and make necessary changes accordingly.

2. End of the Windows era:
With the rise of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices, the personal computer is no longer the only means of accessing the internet. This shift in the tech landscape has made the future of Windows uncertain. Microsoft has been slowly moving away from PCs and towards mobile devices, and their new strategy involves creating software that works across all devices. They aim to create a unified windows platform where all hardware runs on a single operating system.

3. Subscription-based model:
Another plausible reason for this move is that Microsoft has shifted its focus towards a subscription-based model. With Office 365 and other services, Microsoft has gained a significant foothold in the subscription market. By discontinuing future versions of Windows and working with a model where users pay for regular updates and upgrades, Microsoft may be looking to further monetize its user base.

4. Compatibility issues:
Windows has always been known for its compatibility issues, often frustrating users when their software no longer runs on newer versions of Windows. This is a significant problem for both users and software developers. By sticking to Windows 10 and ensuring all future updates work across all devices, Microsoft can eliminate any compatibility issues.

Conclusion:
The decision by Microsoft to discontinue future versions of Windows may have shocked the tech world, but it's not as surprising as it may seem. With constant software updates, the need for a new version of Windows every few years is no longer necessary. Instead, Microsoft is focused on creating a united Windows platform that works across all devices. The shift in focus towards a subscription-based model also justifies this move. Regardless of the reason, it's clear that Microsoft is continually evolving to stay ahead in the tech world.

During the Microsoft Ignite conference in Chicago, one of the software maker employees, Jerry Nixon, said: “Right now we’re releasing Windows 10, and because Windows 10 is the last version of Windows, we’re all still working on Windows 10.”
 
As it may have sounded like Microsoft will stop developing the world most popular operating system, he was actually referring that the future is “Windows as a service”.
 
While Microsoft has talked in the past about the idea of having Windows offered as a service, the company has never really described what the future of Windows looks like. However, the reason could be because probably we won’t be seeing any major release of the operating system moving forward.
 
Beginning with Windows 10, Microsoft has changed the way Windows is built. Instead of releasing major versions, as we have seen with Windows XP and Windows 7, the company is moving toward incremental updates and feature releases.
 
This type of rapid releases is possible by making Windows a modular operating system, which allows Microsoft to update parts of the Windows independently of each other, instead of having to update the entire core. It’s a challenge, but the software maker has invested a lot of work on making Windows 10 a single piece of software that run across PCs, tablets, game console, and phones.
 
You can already see this with the number of apps and services that are part of Windows 10, such as the Xbox and Mail apps, Microsoft Edge web browser, and even Office will include regular updates instead of big releases.
 
Starting with Windows 10, we’ll need to begin thinking that future releases won’t be major, like previous releases. Releases of Windows will be much like Chrome and Firefox, which get regular updates and most people don’t really seem to care much. This is pretty much how Microsoft envisions the idea of Windows as a service, and what the company describes as Windows 10 being the last major release of Windows.
 
Although, Microsoft could always go with “Windows 11”, “Windows 12”, or “Windows 13” — well, scratch the last one, Microsoft would never use of the number “13” on any of its products –, maybe what’s really going to happen is Microsoft going with simply “Windows” without versioning.
