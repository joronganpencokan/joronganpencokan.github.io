Title: Unlock the Secret to Running Multiple Linux Distros Simultaneously with this Genius Hack!

Are you a Linux enthusiast who finds running multiple Linux distributions tempting but tedious? Does your computer run slow and sluggish when you have more than two or three distributions installed? Well, have no fear! We have found a genius hack that will allow you to run multiple Linux distros simultaneously without any lag or confusion.

First, let us explore why running multiple Linux distributions simultaneously is an excellent idea. Each Linux distro offers its unique features and benefits. Some are geared towards privacy, while others are for gaming or programming. By running multiple Linux distributions simultaneously, you can take advantage of these unique features without having to switch between them.

Now, let us dive into the method you can use to run multiple Linux distros concurrently. The answer is VirtualBox, a free and open-source virtualization software. It enables you to create virtual machines running different operating systems and run them simultaneously without affecting your operating system.

The first step is to download VirtualBox and install it on your operating system. Once installed, you can create virtual machines for each Linux distro you want to run. Installing Linux distributions as virtual machines is similar to installing them on your primary system. You can download the ISO file and upload it to VirtualBox, and the installation process follows. Once you have completed the installation process, you can launch each virtual machine and run multiple Linux distros simultaneously.

VirtualBox is a handy tool that allows you to create virtual machines while using your computer's resources efficiently. You can allocate resources like RAM and storage to each virtual machine so that none of them compete for resources or overload your computer. Furthermore, VirtualBox also allows you to take snapshots of virtual machines, which enables you to restore them to the previous state if something goes wrong.

In conclusion, running multiple Linux distributions simultaneously is a brilliant idea, but it can slow down your computer if you install them as your primary operating system. VirtualBox is a genius hack that allows you to create virtual machines and run multiple Linux distributions simultaneously without any lag or confusion. Download VirtualBox and start exploring the world of Linux today!

## How to Run Multiple Distros Using Linux Containers


The method is quite simple and easy and you just need to follow the simple guide to turning your android into the wireless flash drive for your mac. So follow the below guide to proceed.

 
### Steps To Run multiple Distros Using Linux Containers:
 
#### #1 Install and Configure the Linux Containers


This method can be used for Linux Mint 18 64-bit or the Ubuntu 16.04 or above.
1. First of install up to the Linux Containers on your Linux device using up the command “sudo apt install lxc lxc-te” through the terminal. This will automatically install up to the Linux Containers on your Linux system, you just need to check that there is the Live internet connection always there.
2. Now you will need to configure up your profile for the Linux Containers and for that you need to run up the below commands in the terminal:
3. To set up the user permissions you again have to execute the below commands:

 
#### #2 Set up the Container


After the above step when you have installed up the LXc container then you have to follow up some steps to set up the container and the steps are given below:
1. We will be setting up the Ubuntu Container named <code>ubu1</code> and for that, you have to execute the command “lxc-create –template downl”
2. After that, you will see the list of all supported Distro images in your terminal app. Just enter up the specifics or the details of the Distro that you wish to install. This could also be done through the command “lxc-create -t download -n u“.
3. This will then download the image file for that Linux Distro you have selected and then install it on your host system. This might take up some time because the distro file isn’t too small, you need to download it up before.
4. After the installation process completes you will then be ready to play up that distro inside the containers on your Linux OS.

 
### #3 Using up the Multiple Distros with LXC containers:


1. Start up the container using up the command “lxc-start -n ubul -d” where the <code>-n</code> specifies the name of the container which you wish to start up and the <code>-d</code> type makes it run on your device.
2. You can easily verify the container being started or not by the command “lxc-ls -f” in the terminal app.
# To stop up your container you can execute the command “lxc-stop -n ubu1” while if you wish to auto start your containers at the boot then you could execute the command “lxc.start.auto = 1″, “lxc.start.delay = 5” run these command simultaneously without the break and you are done.
So this was the method through which you could easily run any of your selected Linux Distro on your single Hosted Linux OS device. You have now got up that you would not require going through so many complex settings and options so as to made up the distro run virtually on your Linux OS. Just apply up to the method and therefore run up the multiple Linux Distros even on your single OS hosted Linux device!
