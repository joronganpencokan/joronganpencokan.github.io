# Netflix Users Beware: Discover the Trick to Removing Download Devices and Freeing Up Essential Space!

As a Netflix user, have you ever noticed that your device's storage space becomes full frequently? Well, the reason for this could be the downloaded movies and series on your Netflix app. While downloading content is an excellent feature of the app, it can also take up a lot of space, especially if you forget to remove the download devices. But not to worry, we’ve got you covered. In this article, we will discuss how to remove download devices and free up essential space on your device.

## Step 1: Check the Downloaded Devices

The first step to freeing up space on your Netflix app is to check the devices where you have downloaded content. To do this, open the Netflix app on your mobile device and tap on the menu icon at the upper left corner of the screen. Next, select "My Downloads" and tap on the icon that shows your user profile in the upper right corner of the screen. From this menu, select "App Settings" and tap on "Download Quality" to view the devices where content has been downloaded.

## Step 2: Remove Downloads From Devices

After you see the download devices, select the device you want to remove content from and tap on "Delete All Downloads." This will remove all the downloaded content from that device, freeing up valuable space on your device. Repeat this for every device that you no longer need to have downloaded content on. 

## Step 3: Manage Download Quality

Another way you can free up space on your device is by adjusting the "Download Quality" settings. To do this, navigate to "App Settings," and select "Download Quality." From here, you can choose to adjust the quality to either "Standard" or "Higher." Select "Standard" if you have storage issues on your device, and select "Higher" if you have ample storage.

## Step 4: Delete Old Content

Lastly, if you have downloaded movies and series that you no longer need, delete them from your device. To do this, go to "My Downloads" on the main menu and select the movie or series you want to delete. Tap on the "Edit" icon on the upper right corner of the screen and select the content you want to remove. Tap on "Delete" to remove the content, freeing up your device's valuable storage space.

In conclusion, by following these steps, you can easily remove download devices and free up essential space on your device. This will give you more room to download more content and enjoy your Netflix experience. Follow these tips and enjoy your favorite movies and series seamlessly!

The download option is available within the Netflix app on mobile and Windows PC. Although the offline playback feature is useful, Netflix limits the number of devices you can use to download videos for offline viewing.
For example, if you are subscribed to the Basic plan, you can only download videos on a single device. Similarly, the Standard plan allows you to download on two devices. So, when you try to download videos on a new device, and if your download device limit is reached, you will see a Download Error message like this.
