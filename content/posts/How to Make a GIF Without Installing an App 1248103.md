GIFs can be a fun way to share your emotions or thoughts with others online. And while most social apps come with their own GIF library, did you know that you can make your own? You don’t even have to install an app in order to do so. In this tutorial, we show how you can quickly make a GIF on your desktop or mobile without adding another app to your lineup.
 
Tip: if you prefer working with stickers instead, learn how to add and use stickers on WhatsApp. 
 
## 1. GIPHY
 
GIPHY is a website that offers free access to a large collection of GIFs. You can easily share them simply by copying their link, but if you can’t find a GIF you like on the site, you can always create your own. You can access GIPHY in your browser, whether you’re on a PC or mobile device.
 
- Go to the GIPHY website in your browser.
 - Click on the “Create” button in the upper-right corner.

 
Note: you’ll need to create an account with GIPHY if you want to create a GIF but don’t need an account simply to share GIFs from the platform.
 
- Click on the “Choose files” button underneath the GIF option. You can upload various types of image and video files to create your GIF, including JPG, PNG, and MP4.

 
- If you wish to create a GIF out of images, upload the first one to open the editing screen.
 - Click on “Add more images” underneath the image.

 
- Select how long you want each image to play by dragging the slider on the right side of the display.

 
- Click the “Browse Files” button to add the rest.
 - Once you’ve added all the pictures, you’ll see a preview of your GIF. If you’re okay with everything, click on “Continue to decorate” to add extra customizations to your creation.

 
- From the editing screen, you can add a caption and stickers and apply a filter. If you’re feeling even more creative, start drawing on the GIF. Switch between these options by pressing the buttons in the upper right. These additions will be applied to the entire GIF.

 
- Once everything looks good to you, press the “Continue to Upload” button.
 - Add the source of your images and some tags for your GIF, if you’d like. You can also opt whether your GIF will be public or private. If you don’t feel like sharing your creation with others, it can be simply be saved to your account.

 
- Press “Upload to GIPHY” to create your GIF.
 - With your GIF uploaded, you can easily share it with others or embed it in your blog.

 
- If you uploaded a video, you’ll need to go through all the steps outlined above plus one more: you’ll have to select the specific part of the video you want to turn into a GIF. When you’re done, press “Continue to Decorate.”

 
GIPHY is also available in the form of a mobile app (Android | iOS), so if you have enough free space for another app, you can download it. It comes with a few additional options, like camera filters and the ability to snap your images or shoot videos directly from the app. 
 
## 2. Imgur
 
Imgur is a well-known meme site that also has a GIF creation tool. Unlike the previous option, you can only use videos to create a GIF on Imgur. Access the tool via your browser on your computer or mobile device.
 
- Open Imgur in your browser.
 - Click on the “New post” button at the top.

 
- Select the “Video to GIF” option on the right side of the screen.

 
- Paste a link to a video. Unfortunately, uploading personal videos directly from your PC is not an option. You can, however, upload the video to your personal YouTube channel and use the link on Imgur.

 
- On the next screen, select the part of the video you want to transform into a GIF. Use the handles to choose the specific part.

 
- Press “Create GIF.”
 - You can easily share the GIF you’ve created by pressing on the “Share” button.

 
- If you wish to download the GIF for safekeeping, press on the three dots in the upper-right corner and select “Download.”
 - A free alternative to Imgur is Adobe’s Express video to GIF converter. You’ll need to sign up with an account.

 - In the upper-left corner, tap on “Live” to bring up a list of options.

 
- Select either “Bounce” or “Loop” to turn your picture into a GIF.

If you don’t have the Shortcuts app on your iPhone, you’ll need to download it from the App Store.
 
- Open the Shortcuts app on your iPhone.
 - Tap on the “Make GIF” shortcut (which installs with the app).

 
- Upload a Live image or video to start the process.
 - Press “Done” to finalize the process.

 
- You’ll find the GIF in the “Animated” section under Albums in the Photos app.

 
- Alternatively, you can get the Video to GIF shortcut and convert your videos into GIFs.

 
- You can also convert Burst photos to GIF. You’ll just need to install the relevant shortcut.

 
- Once you have the shortcut onboard, tap on it and select the Burst photo in question.
 - The shortcut will convert it. Press “Done” to finish the process.

 
- The shortcut will ask what you wish to do with it: share it immediately or save it to your gallery.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are some of the best third-party tools to create GIFs?
 
If the methods we’ve outlined here haven’t yielded the results you hoped for, you can always turn to third-party apps. You may need to clear some space on your device first, though. Some worthy GIF-making apps you can try (apart from GIPHY – which is mentioned above) are:
 
- GIF Maker and Editor (Android)

 
- GIF Me! (Android | iOS)

 
- Coub (Android | iOS)

 
### Can I convert my GIFs back into video if I deleted the original material?
 
Yes. There are various converters and apps online for that. For instance, Canva has a dedicated tool that allows you to quickly transform a GIF into an MP4. If you’ve created your GIF out of images you then deleted, unfortunately, you don’t have the option to separate them using an online tool. What you can do, however, is take screenshots of the individual images, then crop them.
 
### Why is the quality of my GIF poor?
 
Some of the GIFs you’ve created might look pixelated and less colorful than the original video due to the fact that the file format has been around since 1987 and uses only 256 colors. GIFs were designed to be efficient, small files, best suited for short clips with similar frames.
