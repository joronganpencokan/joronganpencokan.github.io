When it comes to smartphones, Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is one of the most popular devices out there. Its powerful features and large display make it a favorite among tech enthusiasts and business professionals alike. But did you know that there is a simple hack that can unlock the full potential of this device? Read on to learn more.

First things first, let's talk about what this hack is all about. It involves rooting your Samsung Galaxy Note 3. For those who are not familiar with the term, rooting is essentially the process of gaining root-level access to your device's operating system. This allows you to make changes and modifications to your device that would not otherwise be possible.

Now, before we go any further, it's important to note that rooting your device can void your warranty and potentially harm your device if not done correctly. That said, if you're willing to take the risk, rooting your Samsung Galaxy Note 3 can be a game-changer.

So, what does rooting allow you to do on your Samsung Galaxy Note 3? Here are a few ways it can help you unlock your device's full potential:

1. Remove Bloatware

One of the most significant benefits of rooting your Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the ability to uninstall bloatware. Bloatware refers to pre-installed apps that come with your device and cannot be uninstalled. These apps take up valuable space on your device and may even slow it down. Rooting allows you to get rid of these apps and free up space on your device.

2. Improved Performance

Rooting your Samsung Galaxy Note 3 can significantly improve the device's performance. By gaining root access, you can customize your device's kernel and tweak CPU settings for optimal performance. You can also download apps that require root access to improve performance, such as Greenify, which helps save battery life by hibernating apps.

3. Customization

Another significant benefit of rooting your Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is customization. Rooting allows you to install custom ROMs (modified versions of Android) and customize your device's theme, icons, and fonts. You can also install apps like Xposed Installer, which allows you to customize your device further by accessing modules that are not available on non-rooted devices.

4. Boost Battery Life

Rooting your Samsung Galaxy Note 3 can also help improve battery life. You can install apps like Greenify, which hibernates apps in the background, preventing them from draining your device's battery. You can also tweak CPU settings and kernel values to improve battery life further.

In conclusion, rooting your Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is a simple hack that can unlock the device's full potential. While it does come with some risks, the benefits are significant. From removing bloatware to improving performance and customizing your device, rooting allows you to make the most of your Samsung Galaxy Note 3. So, are you ready to unlock your device's full potential?

Samsung devices have generally shipped with an unlocked bootloader, making it very easy to root them. The recently released Galaxy Note 3 is no exception, even though it comes pre-loaded with Samsung’s Knox security feature out-of-the-box. 
The only issue is that once the device has been rooted, Knox status will change, voiding the warranty of the device. As of now, there is no way to reset the Knox status back to its original value, so keep this in mind before you decide to root your Note 3.
The steps below should work for all variants of the Galaxy Note 3 that come with an unlocked bootloader.
Step 1: Head over to this thread on XDA forums and download the CWM recovery meant for your variant of the Note 3. Make sure you are downloading the correct version, otherwise you will end up bricking your handset. Also, download ODIN from here and the SuperSu ZIP package from here. Transfer the SuperSU ZIP file to the root of your Note 3’s internal storage.
Step 2: Extract the contents of the ODIN ZIP file on your desktop. Do not extract the CWM recovery file. The file must end with a .tar extension.
Step 3: Download and install the required USB drivers for your Samsung device. You can skip this step if you have KIES installed on your PC.
Step 4: Put your Galaxy Note 3 into Download mode by switching it off, re-inserting the battery, and then simultaneously pressing the Volume Down + Home + Power button. Skip the custom OS warning by pressing the Volume Up button.

Step 5: Fire up ODIN and click on the PDA button, and then select the CWM recovery tar file. Now, connect your Note 3 to your PC and wait for the drivers to be installed.
Step 6: Once the drivers have been installed, ODIN will detect your Note 3 and automatically display a random number inside the COM Box. Now, press the Start button and wait for ODIN to flash the custom recovery.
Step 7: After the recovery has been flashed, your device will automatically reboot. Now put your Note 3 into Recovery mode by switching the device off, re-inserting the battery, and then simultaneously pressing the Volume Up + Home + Power button.
Step 8: Once the device has booted into CWM Recovery, select the ‘install zip from sdcard’ option. Then select the SuperSU zip file and install it. After the zip file has been flashed, select the ‘reboot system now’ option to go back into Android OS.
You have now successfully managed to gain root access on your Note 3 and void its warranty in the process. Keep in mind that you cannot accept any future OTA updates now. You will have to manually get hold of the OTA package and install the update via CWM recovery.
