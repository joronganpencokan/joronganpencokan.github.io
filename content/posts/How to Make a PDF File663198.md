##   How to Make a PDF File in Windows  
 

If you're using Windows, you have an option to create a PDF file using the print function of your computer and it works in any program that you're using that has printing capabilities. It's called Microsoft Print to PDF.

 

Open the Word document you want to convert to PDF and then select File.

 

In the File menu, select Save As.

 

In the Save As dialog, select the File Type dropdown menu and then choose PDF.

 

Change the title of the document or change the location where you want the file saved and then click Save and your PDF file will be saved to the specified location.

 

The options you'll see will depend on the program you're printing from but they should generally follow this structure:

 
- To use Microsoft Print to PDF, in the document, image, or another file you want to use as the basis for a PDF, select Print.
 - In the Print dialog box, change the printer (it may be called Destination or Destination Printer or simply Printer) to Save as PDF or Microsoft Print to PDF.
 - The Google Chrome browser also has a similar PDF conversion feature that works for any web-based file on any device using the Chrome browser. All you need to do is access the Print option and choose Print to PDF.
 - The preview will adjust to show you what the PDF will look like. If you're satisfied, select Print or Save.

 
##   How to Create a PDF File in Google Docs  
 

When you're creating documents, spreadsheets, or presentations using Google Drive you have the option to convert those documents to PDF, too. You can use the print menu as above, but from both a Windows or Mac computer, you can also choose File > Download > PDF Document (.pdf). The PDF file will be placed into your Downloads file.

 

To use Microsoft Print to PDF, in the document, image, or another file you want to use as the basis for a PDF, select Print.

 

In the Print dialog box, change the printer (it may be called Destination or Destination Printer or simply Printer) to Save as PDF or Microsoft Print to PDF.

##   How to Create a PDF on Mac in Pages  
 

If you're using a Mac computer, you have nearly as many options for creating PDF files as Windows does. Aside from the methods mentioned above, you can also create a PDF file from the Pages app, much like you would from Word in Windows.

 
- Open the document you want to use to create a PDF in Pages.
 - Select the File menu at the top of the page and then select Print.
 - In the menu that appears, use the dropdown menu in the lower-left corner to choose Save as PDF.
 - The Save As dialog box opens. Give your document a name, choose a location to save it, and add any additional details and then click Save.

 
If the Mac app you are using allows for printing, there's nearly a 100% chance the same steps below will make a PDF in that app, too.
 

Open the document you want to use to create a PDF in Pages.

 

Select the File menu at the top of the page and then select Print.

 

In the menu that appears, use the dropdown menu in the lower-left corner to choose Save as PDF.
