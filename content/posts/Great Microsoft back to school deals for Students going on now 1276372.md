It’s that time of the year again. It’s time to shop for back to school supplies (at least in the U.S.), and if you’re in the hunt to tech gear and you want to save some cash, Microsoft products may just be what you need. Below there is a list of current deals going on now and until mid-September, some offers include free copies of Office 365 University and gift cards. All from different U.S. electronic retailers such as Best Buy, Staples, Office, Microsoft Store, etc.

## Staples
 
From June 23th to September 7th, 2013, customers can get a free copy of Office 365 university with the purchase of certain Windows 8 touch laptops.
 
## Best Buy
 
The same as in the Microsoft Store, Best Buy is also offering the new $100 discount on the purchase of a Surface Pro. But the good deal here is that students who register using their .edu email address to register on bestbuy.com/studentsdeals will also receive 10% discount on eligiable All-in-One touch-enable PCs, and a free Microsoft Office 365 University and 16GB USB drive when you buy a selected Windows 8 PC, plus free shipping.
