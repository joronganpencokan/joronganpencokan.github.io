Unleash Your Inner Lawyer: Learn How to Maximize Your Card Level in Tears of Themis in Just 5 Easy Steps!

Tears of Themis is a popular mobile game that features a thrilling blend of visual novel storytelling and card-based gameplay. In the game, players take on the role of a young lawyer who must solve intricate cases by investigating clues, questioning witnesses, and presenting evidence.

One of the key elements of Tears of Themis is building and leveling up your deck of cards, which represent different skills and abilities that can help you in your investigations. However, just like in real life, building a strong deck requires strategy and planning.

If you're looking to maximize your card level in Tears of Themis and become a top-notch lawyer, then you've come to the right place. In this article, we'll walk you through 5 easy steps to help you unleash your inner lawyer and dominate the game.

1. Know Your Cards

The first step to building a strong deck is to know your cards. Tears of Themis features over 100 different cards with unique abilities, ranging from basic investigation skills to powerful attacks that can knock out enemy cards in battle.

Before you start leveling up your cards, take some time to study their abilities and understand how they can work together to create a winning strategy. Read the card descriptions carefully, and experiment with different combinations to see what works best for you.

2. Focus on Core Skills

In the early stages of the game, it's important to focus on leveling up your core investigation skills, such as Insight, Logic, and Deduction. These skills will help you to uncover clues and gather evidence more efficiently, which is essential for solving cases and earning rewards.

As you progress through the game, you can start to diversify your deck and add more specialized cards for specific tasks, such as combat or interrogation. But in the beginning, keep it simple and focus on building a strong foundation of core skills.

3. Prioritize Your Upgrades

Once you have a solid deck of cards, it's time to start leveling them up. Each card can be upgraded using experience points (XP) and materials, which can be earned by completing cases and other activities in the game.

When deciding which cards to upgrade, prioritize those that have the most impact on your core skills and gameplay. For example, if you rely heavily on Insight to find clues, then focus on upgrading cards that boost your Insight level or provide additional Insight bonuses.

4. Use the Refine Feature

In addition to upgrading your cards, you can also refine them to unlock additional abilities and bonuses. Refining can be done using special items called Crystal Shards, which can be obtained through various activities in the game.

Refining your cards can greatly enhance their effectiveness and give you a strategic advantage in battles and investigations. Make sure to check the refine options for each card and invest in the ones that will benefit your gameplay the most.

5. Join a Club

Finally, joining a Club in Tears of Themis can provide significant benefits for your deck and overall gameplay experience. Clubs allow you to team up with other players to complete special missions, earn rewards, and share cards and resources.

Being part of a Club can also give you access to exclusive cards and bonuses that can't be found anywhere else in the game. So if you're serious about maximizing your card level and becoming a top lawyer in Tears of Themis, then finding and joining a Club is a must.

Conclusion

Building a strong deck of cards is a critical aspect of the gameplay in Tears of Themis, and it requires careful planning and strategy. By following these 5 easy steps, you can unleash your inner lawyer and become a master of the game in no time.

Remember to study your cards, focus on core skills, prioritize your upgrades, use the refine feature, and join a Club for maximum benefits. With a little bit of practice and patience, you'll be solving cases like a pro and climbing the ranks in Tears of Themis. Good luck!
