MySQL is the database that holds important information like user credentials, website content, or options like size and color for your favorite products. It's part of a "stack" of software called LAMP, which stands for Linux, the Apache web server, MySQL, and the PHP programming language.

 

Here's why you might want to install MySQL on Windows 10 and how to do so.

 
##   Why Install MySQL on Windows 10?  
 

MySQL is free, open-source software, and you can even download the source code if you like. For many, this is one reason it was trusted to be part of the world's most popular web platform. In more practical terms, it means you can freely download and use MySQL for yourself.

 

Why would you want to do this? Well, if you're curious about technology, you can play around with it to see how it works. You can create your own databases, either for educational purposes or keep track of important items at home. You could also install it to learn SQL, the programming language used to manage and interact with most databases.

 
##   How to Download MySQL's Free Community Edition  
 

Before installing the MySQL Free Community edition, download it on your PC:

 
- Go to the MySQL website and select Downloads.
 - Select MySQL Community (GPL) Downloads. The Community Edition is the free, open-source version of MySQL.
 - The main difference between the paid Standard edition and the free Community edition is Oracle Premier Support, which gives you access to a support line, consulting service, and a knowledge base. The main functionality of MySQL is largely intact for both versions.
 - On the following page, select MySQL Community Server.
 - Scroll down to the bottom of the page and select the Go to Download Page next to Windows (x86, 32 & 64-bit), MySQL Installer MSI.
 - The next page will ask you to choose between two installer files:
 - If you have an active Internet connection, select the top download.If you have to be offline when you install, select the bottom download.
 - The first option will download data while you install, while the second option has it all in one package.
 - Filename will vary depending on the MySQL version.
