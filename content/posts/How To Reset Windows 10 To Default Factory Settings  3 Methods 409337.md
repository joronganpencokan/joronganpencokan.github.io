# You won't believe how easy it is to reset Windows 10 with these 3 methods!

Have you ever encountered a problem with your Windows 10 computer that left you frustrated and helpless? Perhaps a virus has infected your system, or you've installed too many programs that bogged down your memory. Whatever the issue may be, sometimes the best solution is to reset your computer to its factory settings.

But don't worry – it's not as daunting as it sounds. With these three simple methods, you'll be able to reset your Windows 10 computer in no time at all.

## Method 1: Using the Windows 10 reset option

The easiest and most straightforward way to reset your Windows 10 computer is to utilize the inbuilt reset option. Here's how:

1. Click the Windows button on the taskbar, then click the gear icon in the Start menu to open Settings.
2. In the Settings menu, click on Update & Security.
3. Click on Recovery, then select the option to Reset this PC.
4. You'll now be presented with two options: either keep your personal files or remove everything. Choose the option that best suits your needs.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to reset your computer.

That's it – your Windows 10 computer has been reset to its factory settings.

## Method 2: Using the Windows installation media

If you don't have access to the built-in reset option, you can use the Windows installation media instead. Here's how:

1. Insert the Windows installation media (DVD, USB drive, etc.) into your computer and restart it.
2. When prompted to boot from the installation media, press any key to continue.
3. After selecting your language and other preferences, click on Install Now.
4. Accept the license terms and click Next.
5. Select the option to Custom install Windows only (advanced).
6. Choose the drive where you want to install Windows.
7. Click on the Drive Options link, then select the option to Format.
8. Click on the Next button to begin the installation process.

It may take some time for Windows 10 to install, but once it's done, your computer will be reset to its factory settings.

## Method 3: Using a third-party tool

If neither of the above methods works for you, there are several third-party tools available that can help you reset your Windows 10 computer. One popular option is the "Windows Password Reset" tool, which not only resets your password, but also restores your computer to its factory settings.

To use the tool, simply download and install it on another computer, and then create a bootable USB drive or CD/DVD. Insert the drive or disk into your Windows 10 computer and restart it. Follow the on-screen instructions to reset your computer.

In Conclusion

We hope that these three methods have shown you just how easy it is to reset your Windows 10 computer. Whether you use the built-in reset option, the Windows installation media, or a third-party tool, resetting your computer doesn't have to be a daunting task. So the next time you encounter a problem with your Windows 10 computer, don't panic – just reset it!
