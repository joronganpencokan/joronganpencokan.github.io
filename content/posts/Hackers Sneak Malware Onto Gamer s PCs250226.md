Gamers Beware! Hackers are Sneaking Insidious Malware into Your PCs - Here's What You Need to Do!

Gamers are a prime target for hackers who are constantly on the lookout for vulnerabilities to exploit, especially when it comes to online gaming. With the increase in the popularity of online gaming, hackers have found a new vector to deploy their malicious payloads. From ransomware to keyloggers, hackers have been sneaking insidious malware into gamers' PCs undetected. Therefore, it is essential that you take the right precautions to keep your gaming rig safe from malware.

Here are some of the steps that you can take to protect your PC from malware:

1. Keep your system up to date: Make sure that your operating system, software applications, and gaming platforms are always up to date. Keeping your software up to date is crucial as it helps to patch security vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

2. Use an antivirus software: Make sure that your gaming rig is protected by a reputable antivirus software that provides real-time protection. This way, your antivirus can quickly detect and remove any malware that tries to infect your system.

3. Be careful of what you download: Only download games, mods, and other gaming-related files from trusted sources. Always scan any files that you download with an antivirus software before opening or installing them.

4. Use a VPN: When gaming online, using a VPN can help to protect your identity and prevent hackers from tracking your online activities. A VPN can also help to protect you from DDoS attacks and prevent hackers from intercepting your traffic.

5. Be careful of phishing scams: Always be careful of phishing scams that are designed to trick you into revealing your login credentials. If you receive an email or message asking for your login details, always verify the sender's identity before responding.

6. Invest in a hardware firewall: A hardware firewall can provide an additional layer of protection for your gaming rig. A hardware firewall can help to block malicious traffic and prevent hackers from accessing your system remotely.

In conclusion, hackers are always on the lookout for vulnerabilities to exploit, and gamers are a prime target. Therefore, it is essential to take the necessary measures to protect your gaming rig from malware. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can help to ensure that your gaming sessions are safe and secure. Stay aware and stay safe!

Since at least 2018, hackers have been sneaking malware dubbed "Crackonosh" into torrent downloads of popular video games in order to use gamers' PCs to farm Moreno cryptocurrency.

 

Security firm Avast has reported that torrent downloads of popular PC games such as NBA 2K19, GTA V, and Far Cry 5 are being used to install "mining malware" on gamers' PCs. The malware, which Avast refers to as "Crackonosh," takes advantage of Windows Safe mode to skirt around antivirus software. It then disables system security features in order to make itself more difficult to detect or remove.

 

One major red flag to look out for is your PC unexpectedly restarting in Safe Mode, which Avast notes could take several restarts after installing the infected downloads. Most security programs don't activate when the system boots up in Safe Mode, which allows the malware to finish installing itself.

 

Part of this process includes searching for and deleting antivirus programs such as Adaware, Norton, and McAfee.

 

If you believe Crackonosh may have been installed on your computer, you can take a look at Avast's Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) document to see if anything matches up. You also can find detailed instructions on removing the malware from your system in Avast's report.

 

Avast cautions against downloading and installing cracked software, stating, "The key take-away from this is that you really canâ€™t get something for nothing and when you try to steal software, odds are someone is trying to steal from you."

 

It is theorized that Crackonosh has been in circulation since at least 2018, using over 222,000 infected PCs to mine over $2 million in Moreno cryptocurrency worldwide.
