# Revolutionize Your Productivity: Discover the Secret to Repeating Tasks and Tracking Accomplishments with Todoist!

In today’s fast-paced world, it is easy to get overwhelmed with the demands of work and personal responsibilities. With only 24 hours in a day, it’s difficult to accomplish all that needs to be done, and this can adversely impact our productivity.

But what if there was a tool that could help you manage your tasks, boost your productivity, and take the stress out of daily to-do lists? Enter Todoist, a versatile productivity app, which can help you stay organized, focused, and on top of your tasks.

Here are some tips on how Todoist can revolutionize your productivity and help you stay on track:

## Repeat tasks quickly and conveniently

If you have tasks that you need to repeat daily, weekly, or monthly, Todoist’s repeating task feature can help you stay on track. With Todoist, you can set a task to repeat at intervals that work for you.

For instance, if you need to pay rent every month, you can create a task with a reminder to pay rent on the first of every month. Todoist will automatically create a new task for you at the set interval, reminding you to pay your rent.

## Keep track of your accomplishments

One of the most motivating things that you can do is to keep track of your accomplishments. But with so much going on, it can be difficult to remember what you have done, and celebrate your successes.

Todoist comes with a built-in feature that allows you to keep track of your completed tasks. As you complete a task, it will automatically move to your completed list. You can then review your completed list to gain insight into your achievements and track your progress over time.

## Use labels and filters to organize and prioritize tasks

Todoist’s label and filter features help you categorize and prioritize your tasks. Labels enable you to quickly tag your tasks with keywords, such as “urgent” or “important.” This makes it easy to sort and filter your tasks based on specific criteria.

For instance, if you need to focus on urgent tasks first thing in the morning, you can filter your task list to display urgent items only. This helps you prioritize your tasks and stay focused on what needs to be done first.

## Collaborate with others

Todoist also allows you to collaborate with others on tasks. You can share tasks with other people, assign tasks to team members, and receive notifications when tasks are completed.

This feature is particularly useful for teams working on a project. Todoist enables teams to stay organized and aligned, ensuring that everyone is aware of what needs to be done, and when.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Todoist is an excellent tool for anyone looking to boost their productivity and stay on top of their tasks. With its repeating task feature, task completion tracking, label and filter system, and collaboration features, Todoist can help users focus on what’s important, prioritize tasks, and achieve their goals.

If you’re looking for a versatile, user-friendly, and effective productivity tool, Todoist is definitely worth a try!

By the way, there's always been some question in my mind whether to-do is "todo," "to-do," or "to do." Most folks don't need to worry about this, but these things keep me up at night. I once did an entire article about how to format the word "cyberattack" properly. Once you become an editor, something just snaps on in your brain, and you can't unsee the formatting inconsistencies.
In any case, what about to-do? As it turns out, it's to-do (with a dash). How do I know that? Well, as much as there really is some discussion on The Internet about this picky little subject,  both the Merriam-Webster dictionary and Grammarhow declare the dash to be the deal. So it's to-do and to-do list. 
That said, the name of the product we're looking at today is conspicuously dashless. Such is the chaotic state of the world today.

##  How to see tasks you've completed 


As it turns out, it's pretty easy to see the tasks you've completed. If you look at the upper-left side of the Todoist screen, you'll see what looks like a little pie chart. 
Note the numbers next to the circle: 
Todoist lets you define a certain number of cleared tasks as a daily goal. In my case, I want to clear five tasks a day. So far, I've knocked off three. When I complete this article, that will move to four. 
If you click that pie chart, you'll see a drop-down information pane: 
That pane shows you information about how many tasks you've cleared today and this week. It also has a link you can click to see your actual completed tasks. 
These are mine so far today: 
Notice that one of the tasks I completed is called "Banks and Bills." I wrote a whole article on that practice, explaining that it's the single best way to protect yourself against credit card fraud. It's worth a read.
If you want to print that task list to turn it in to your boss, click on your profile icon and hit print. That's all there is to it. You can also save the print as a PDF and email that to your manager. 

 
##  How to repeat tasks 


There are two ways to repeat tasks. The first is just to duplicate a task and assign it to another day. The other is to set up a task as repeating so that it reappears in your to-do list at the right time. Let's look at both. 
To duplicate a task, move your cursor over to the far right of the task until three dots appear. Click those dots to show the menu, then select Duplicate. 
A copy of the task will appear. Once you duplicate a task, you can edit it however you like. 
Duplicating a task allows you to check off the task today, so it shows up in your completed items, take the other copy and assign it to a future date or different project. 
A far more powerful tool is the one that allows you to schedule a repeating task. This is an area where Todoist truly shines. Let's say I want to write a new article every Thursday. All I need to do is type in my to-do item "Write an article" and then follow it with the repeating pattern of "every Thursday". Todoist will recognize the words, turn them red, and schedule them, all just based on typing out "Every Thursday".  
There are a whole bunch of scheduling words you can use. You can do it every day, every week, every month, every third Tuesday, and more. Here's a great cheat sheet on the Todoist site that will walk you through all the options. 
I'll end with two more related quick tips: 

 
To turn off the repeat function for a given to-do item, just hit the delete key.If the auto-repeat function isn't working, go to Settings->General and make sure the Smart Date Recognition toggle is turned on. 


That's it. Enjoy your Todoist and get some great things done.
