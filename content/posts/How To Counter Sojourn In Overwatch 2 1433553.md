## Best Heroes to Counter Sojourn in Overwatch 2
 
### Lucio
 
Lucio is an extremely fast-moving character in the game. His ability to run on walls is unparalleled. Since Sojourn’s primary fire does not have hitscan, it can be extremely difficult for her to hit Lucio. And that’s not it, Lucio also has Crossfade ability which gives his allies a boost in speed and health. This is extremely helpful when you come up against Sojourn who is known to have poor mobility in Overwatch 2.
 

 
### Zarya
 
Zarya is one such character who can significantly benefit from Sojourn’s rapid attacks. The reason being she has Particle Barrier which can absorb all the incoming hits. She can not only withstand Sojourn’s attacks but also increase the damage output of her Particle Cannon in the process. Furthermore, Zarya can also protect her teammates against Sojourn’s attacks by using the Projected Barrier. Thereby, making her a good counter for Sojourn.
 
### Widowmaker
 
For players who prefer long-range fights, you can’t go wrong with Widowmaker. As explained earlier, Sojourn thrives in mid-range battles due to her relentless fire rate. However, Widowmaker can make quick work of Sojourn provided you keep some distance. Bring your sniping skills to the fore and aim for Sojourn as she’ll be busy handling other enemies or your allies up close.
