Secrets Revealed: Unlock Powerful Features of Your Nexus 9 with These Simple Rooting Steps!

If you are a proud owner of a Nexus 9 tablet, then hats off to you! Your gadget is one of the most powerful Android-based machines out there because it was made by Google, the company that created and owns Android, the world's most popular mobile operating system. But there is a catch. Despite all its capabilities, your Nexus 9 is limited by the rules and regulations imposed by Google and the manufacturers of its components. That means you may not be able to use some features, install certain apps and tweaks, or customize the appearance and behavior of your device as you please.

Well, fret not. There is a way to break free from those chains and unleash the full potential of your Nexus 9. It's called rooting, a process that grants you superuser access to the root or core of your device's operating system, allowing you to modify it to your heart's content. Rooting is legal but may void your warranty, so proceed with caution, and at your own risk. Also, rooting may expose your device to security risks or stability issues, so make sure you do it properly and only if you really need it.

Assuming you still want to root your Nexus 9, here are the steps you need to follow. Before you start, make sure you have backed up all your data, as rooting may erase it, and have charged your tablet's battery or plugged it in. You also need to enable developer options and USB debugging on your Nexus 9 by going to Settings > About tablet and tapping the Build number seven times until you see the message "You are now a developer." Then, go to Settings > Developer options and turn on USB debugging.

Now, download and install the necessary software to root your Nexus 9. The most popular tool is called Nexus Root Toolkit, which supports many Nexus devices and simplifies the rooting process with its user-friendly interface. You can download it from the developer's website at https://www.wugfresh.com/nrt/. Make sure you extract the ZIP file and run the installer as an administrator. Follow the instructions and choose the right options for your Nexus 9, such as the Android version, the build number, and the mode (simple or advanced) of rooting. You can also choose to install a custom recovery, such as TWRP or ClockworkMod, which allows you to flash custom ROMs, kernels, and other mods.

Once you have set up the Nexus Root Toolkit and connected your Nexus 9 to your computer via USB, you should see its name and status on the main screen. If not, click the "Full Driver Installation Guide" button and follow the steps to install the Nexus 9 drivers manually. Then, click the "Backup" button to create a full backup of your Nexus 9's system and data, in case something goes wrong. You can also perform a factory reset at this stage, to ensure a clean and stable rooting process.

Now, it's time to root your Nexus 9. Click the "Root" button and wait for the tool to download the necessary files, unlock the bootloader, and install the superuser app, such as SuperSU or Magisk. Then, your Nexus 9 should reboot automatically, and you should see the superuser icon and message on the screen. Congratulations! You have successfully rooted your Nexus 9 and gained complete control over it.

What can you do now with your rooted Nexus 9? A lot. Here are some examples:

- Remove unwanted pre-installed apps, such as bloatware or carrier apps.
- Install custom ROMs, which are third-party versions of Android with different features, tweaks, and optimizations. Check out XDA Developers, the largest community of Android enthusiasts, for the latest and greatest ROMs for your Nexus 9.
- Flash custom kernels, which are modifications of the Linux kernel that control the hardware and performance of your device. Some kernels offer better battery life, faster speeds, or more features than the stock kernel.
- Customize the appearance and behavior of your Nexus 9 with various themes, fonts, icons, launchers, and mods. You can tweak almost every aspect of your device, from the status bar to the navigation buttons.
- Boost the performance of your Nexus 9 with apps that optimize the CPU, RAM, and storage usage, or with mods that disable unnecessary services or animations. Your device can run smoother, faster, and cooler than ever before.

Of course, with great power comes great responsibility. While rooting your Nexus 9 can be a liberating and exciting experience, it also entails some risks and drawbacks. Here are some of them:

- Security risks: When you root your Nexus 9, you grant access to its root to any app or process, which means that malware or hackers can potentially exploit it to steal your data or control your device. Make sure you only install apps from trusted sources and use antivirus and firewall software to protect your rooted Nexus 9.
- Stability issues: When you modify the core of your Nexus 9's operating system, you may encounter bugs, glitches, or crashes that can affect its performance or usability. Make sure you only use stable and tested mods, kernels, and ROMs, and always have a backup of your original system and data, in case you need to restore them.
- Compatibility issues: When you install custom ROMs, kernels, or mods, you may encounter compatibility issues with certain apps or features that rely on specific hardware or software configurations. Make sure you read the instructions and reviews carefully before installing anything, and make sure you have a way to revert to the stock configuration if necessary.

In conclusion, rooting your Nexus 9 can be a rewarding and empowering way to unlock its full potential and customize it to your liking. However, it also requires some technical skills, cautiousness, and preparation, and may void your warranty or expose your device to security or stability risks. Make sure you weigh the pros and cons carefully and choose the best rooting method for your needs and preferences. Good luck and happy rooting!

The Nexus 9 hit the retail stores and made it to the hands of the public earlier this week. Being a Nexus device, gaining root forward on it was always going to be pretty straightforward. However, thanks to a new version of Android and the Nexus 9 being the first 64-bit Android tablet to hit the retail market, SuperSU developer Chainfire hit a few roadblocks while trying to root his Nexus 9
As they say though, one man’s pain is another man’s gain (Okay, pleasure). He has released a special version of SuperSU v2.18 meant specifically for the Nexus 9 and a patched boot image to make gaining root access on the tablet easier.
Before you proceed with the steps below though, keep in mind that rooting the Nexus 9 requires its bootloader to be unlocked, which means all your data including the installed apps and their data will be lost. Secondly, since Android 5.0 Lollipop is less than a week old, chances are your usual root apps will behave weirdly under it. Either way, if you want to root your Nexus 9 for one reason or another, simply follow the steps below:
Step 1: Create a new folder on your desktop and name it “nexus”. Proceed to download all the files linked below and extract their contents inside this folder.

 

ADB/Fastboot: Windows | Mac
Patched Boot image



Step 2: On your Nexus 9, head over to Settings -> About Device and tap on ‘Build Number’ 7 seven times to enable Developer Options. Then, head back to Settings -> Developer Options and enable the “Enable OEM Unlock” and “ADB Debugging” options.
Step 3: On your Windows or Mac based PC, open up the Command Prompt or Terminal window and navigate to the “nexus” folder on your desktop using the ‘cd’ command (i.e. cd/desktop/nexus).
Connect the Nexus 9 to your PC and make sure to tap on ‘OK’ to authorize your PC for USB Debugging. Then, enter the following command:
If the drivers were properly installed, your Nexus 9 will be detected by your PC and you will get a bunch of random numbers and alphabets. If not, you need to restart your PC and re-install the drivers and try again. Then, enter the following command:
Step 4: Once your Nexus 9 reboots into Bootloader mode, use the Volume keys to navigate and highlight the “FASTBOOT” mode and confirm your selection by pressing the Power button.
Step 5: Enter the below command in Terminal or command prompt to unlock the bootloader of your Nexus 9:
Confirm the prompt on your device by pressing the Volume up button. Your Nexus 9 will reboot now, which is going to take its own sweet time. Once done, you will be back into the Bootloader menu.
Step 5: Copy paste the following command after which your Nexus 9 will reboot back into Bootloader mode. This command will temporary boot a patched boot image that will inject SuperSU into the system partition.
Step 6: Finally, enter the below command to install a patched kernel with a modified ramdisk on your Nexus 9.
Once installed, reboot your Nexus 9 back into Lollipop by executing the below command:
Congrats! You have successfully managed to root your Nexus 9. Though chances are you will not be able to enjoy it much since most root apps are not going to play along nicely with Android 5.0 Lollipop for now.
