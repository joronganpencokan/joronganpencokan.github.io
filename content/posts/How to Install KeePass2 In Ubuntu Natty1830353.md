Stop worrying about passwords forever: Learn how to install Keepass2 in Ubuntu Natty easily!

Digital security is becoming increasingly important as we rely more on online services in our daily lives. The importance of having strong passwords cannot be overstated. Unfortunately, many people use the same weak password for multiple accounts, making themselves easy targets for hackers. The solution to this problem is password managers, software that creates strong passwords for you and stores them securely. Keepass2 is one such password manager that is compatible with Ubuntu Natty, and in this article, we will show you how to install it easily.

Before you start, you should make sure that you have Ubuntu Natty installed on your computer. Keepass2 can be installed from the Ubuntu Software Center, but the latest version may not always be available there. Instead, we will install Keepass2 using a terminal command.

First, open the terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T or by searching for “Terminal” in the Activities menu. Once the terminal is open, you will need to add the Keepass2 repository to Ubuntu’s list of software sources. To do this, enter the following command:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:keepass2-plugins/keepass2-plugin-stable

You will be prompted to enter your password. Type your password and hit Enter.

Next, you will need to update your packages list by running the following command:

sudo apt update

This command updates the list of available packages from the newly added Keepass2 repository.

Finally, install Keepass2 by running this command:

sudo apt install keepass2

The installation process should be quick, and you will be asked to confirm that you want to install the software. Once the installation is complete, you can open Keepass2 from the Applications menu.

Now that you have Keepass2 installed, it’s time to start using it. Keepass2 works by creating a database where you can store your passwords. You can create separate databases for different purposes, such as personal and work accounts. Keepass2 also allows you to generate strong passwords for new accounts, so you don’t have to worry about remembering them.

To create a new database, click on File > New. You will be prompted to create a master password that will be used to encrypt your database. Make sure to choose a strong password that you can remember.

Once you have created your database, you can start adding your accounts to it. Click on the “+” sign to create a new entry. You will be prompted to enter the website, username, and password for the account. You can also add notes or tags to help you organize your accounts.

To use your accounts, simply open Keepass2 and enter your master password to unlock your database. You can then copy and paste the username and password for the account you want to use.

In conclusion, Keepass2 is a great tool that can help you secure your online accounts by creating and storing strong passwords for you. Installing Keepass2 in Ubuntu Natty is easy with the terminal command we have provided. Once you have Keepass2 installed, you can start adding your accounts and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with using strong, unique passwords.

In the past, the best way to get KeePass running on Linux is to install KeePassX, which is a port over version of KeePass 1.x. To get KeePass 2.x to run in Linux, you will need to install a whole bunch of mono libraries and manually install the source file. Worst still, it might not work in the end. Luckily, that kind of days is over. Julian Taylor has released a PPA that allows you to install KeePass 2 easily (only work in Ubuntu or other debian based distro). 
 
Note: The PPA will install a whole bunch of mono libraries in your system. If you are not comfortable with it, this is not for you.

 
## Install KeePass 2 in Ubuntu
 
Open a terminal and type:
 
That’s all you need to get KeePass 2 working in Ubuntu. 
 

 
## Importing KeePassX database to KeePass 2
 
If you have been using KeePassX, your password database will be in .kdb form which is incompatible with KeePass2 .kdbx. Furthermore, when you try to import in your .kdb database to KeePass 2, it will show an error stating that the importing is only supported in Windows.
 
A way to get around this is to first export your .kdb database to KeePassX XML file.
 
Next, in your KeePass2, go to FIle -> Import. Select KeePassX XML as the format and choose the XML file that you have earlier exported.
 
Done.
