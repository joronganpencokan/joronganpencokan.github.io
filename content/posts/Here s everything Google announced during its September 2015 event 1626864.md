Google is introducing a brand new Chromecast. The hardware and design has been completely revamped. Now the device has circular body with better wireless receptions and a flexible HDMI cable. Additionally, the new Chromecast will also support Showtime and Sling TV, and just like its predecessor the price will remain at $35.
 
The search giant also introduced the Chromecast Audio, which looks pretty much identical to the Chromecast, but it’s a device that let you convert any kind of speakers into smart speakers. Just plug the Chromecast Audio into your speaker’s audio jack port and that’s all. Then you can connect to the device via Wi-Fi to make it all work, so you don’t have to deal with Bluetooth connectivity.
 
You can control audio playback wirelessly using your mobile phone or Android Wear devices. There is also a guest mode to share the controls with other people in the same network, and you can synchronize audio throughout the house as well.
 
You can purchase a Chromecast Audio today for the same $35 on the Google Play Store in 17 different countries, and more regions available soon.

## Google’s Pixel C
 
Finally, we have a big surprise, as the search giant announced the new Pixel C tablet running the Chrome operating system. If you care the “C” is for “convertible”.
 
Perhaps the most interesting part about the Pixel C tablet is that shares the same design vision as the Microsoft’s Surface tablet. It’s not as powerful as the Surface Pro 3 or even the Surface Pro 4, but it offers the same tablet or laptop functionality. There isn’t a kickstand, but there is a keyboard cover that connect via Bluetooth and physically using magnets to the device – it even makes a similar clicking sound, just like Surface –. The company claims that you don’t have to charge the keyboard as it will charge automatically by wireless charging when connected to the tablet – single charge will last for months Google says.

Of course, Google’s Pixel C tablet will come pre-loaded with Android Marshmallow version 6.0, and it’s expected to get regular updates every few months.
 
The Pixel C Surface-like tablet starts at $499 for the 32GB, the keyboard will be offered as an additional accessory for $149. The company did announce a release date, but it will be available before the holidays.
