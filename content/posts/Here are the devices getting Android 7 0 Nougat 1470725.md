Android 7.0 Nougat, the next major update of Google’s mobile operating system is officially rolling out to devices, but there are still two questions to be answered: Which phones and tablets are getting Nougat? And when your device will receive the update?
 
Unfortunately, these questions don’t have a simple answer, as it all depends on what device you own and on a number of other variables. Google is slowly rolling out Android Nougat in stages and it will take days and even weeks before you see the update on your device.
 
As always, Google begins by updating its Nexus devices, then it’s up to manufacturers and cellular carriers to push the update. Currently, we also know that Sony and HTC are the only two companies already committed to update some of its phones and tablets to Android 7.0 Nougat. While HTC is saying that its devices will be getting the update this year, Sony has only mentioned that is working to roll out Nougat as soon as possible.
 
Here’s the list of Android phones and tablets currently scheduled to get the Nougat update now and in the near future:
 
## Google
 
- Nexus 6
 - Nexus 9
 - Nexus 5X
 - Nexus 6P
 - Nexus Player
 - Pixel C
 - General Mobile 4G (Android One)

 
## Sony
 
- Xperia Z3+
 - Xperia Z5
 - Xperia Z4 Tablet
 - Xperia Z5 Compact
 - Xperia Z5 Premium
 - Xperia X
 - Xperia XA
 - Xperia XA Ultra
 - Xperia X Performance

 
## HTC
 
- HTC 10
 - HTC One A9
 - HTC One M9

 
## Samsung
 
- Galaxy Note 7
 - Galaxy S7
 - Galaxy S7 Edge
 - Galaxy S6
 - Galaxy S6 edge
 - Galaxy S6 edge+
 - Galaxy Note 5

 
Of course, these aren’t the only companies planning to upgrade their devices to the new version of the operating system. If you don’t own an HTC, Sony, or Nexus device, but you own one of the latest LG or Motorola smartphones, you’re probably are going to get the Nougat update. We’re yet to hear from other companies, such as Huawei, OnePlus, and BlackBerry to confirm which devices will be getting the update.
 
In addition, we already know that the LG V20 smartphone, which arrives in September, will be the first phone coming with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box.
 
Samsung is another big player on mobile that pushes new updates to its devices. While it’s been confirmed that the Galaxy Note 7 will be getting the Nougat update within the next three months, the company hasn’t confirmed exactly which other devices will be next in line to get the update. However, Samsung will be reportedly updating a number of devices as you can see in the list above.
 
Remember that once Google releases a new version of the operating system, manufacturers and mobile carriers have to test the new release and customize it before releasing it as over-the-air (OTA) update, which sometimes can take months.
