Title: Unlock The Secret To Customization: Learn How To Root Your Google Nexus 6P Now!

Subhead: Step-by-Step Guide To Unlock The Power Of Customization

The Google Nexus 6P is an impressive smartphone with one of the best cameras, a sleek design, and a powerful processor. However, despite its impressive features and the ability to install custom ROMs, tweaks, and mods, it’s limited by its stock firmware. That's where “rooting” comes into play.

Rooting is a way to access the deepest levels of Android’s system files, enabling users to install apps that require higher permission levels, such as ad-blockers, backup software and more. This in turn allows Nexus 6P owners to tweak and customize their device in ways that aren't possible on a regular phone.

If you're looking to take your Nexus 6P to the next level of customization or want to install custom ROMs or tweaks, the first step is to unlock the bootloader. This essential process lets you flash custom recoveries like TWRP so that you can install ROMs and mods that offer a variety of features and perform tweaks to your device.

Here's how to root your Nexus 6P:

Step 1: Back up your phone

Before you begin the rooting process, make sure to back up your phone to a safe location. This way, you can restore your data and files if anything goes wrong with the root process.

Step 2: Unlock the bootloader

To unlock the bootloader, you need to enable developer options on your Nexus 6P. To do this, head over to Settings > About Phone and tap Build Number multiple times until you see a prompt that says “You are now a developer!” Then return to the main settings screen, scroll down to Developer options, and enable USB Debugging.

Once you've enabled USB Debugging on your device, connect your Nexus 6P to your computer and launch the bootloader unlocking command. This can be done via the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) tools provided by Google. By entering a series of commands, you'll be able to unlock the bootloader.

Step 3: Install TWRP custom recovery

After unlocking the bootloader, you'll be ready to install a custom recovery like TWRP. To do this, download the TWRP image for your Nexus 6P from the official website, remove the .img file, and save it in an easy to access location on your computer.

Next, connect your Nexus 6P to your PC and launch the ADB tools once again. Once you're in Fastboot mode, type “fastboot flash recovery” followed by the location of the TWRP image. This should install the custom recovery on your Nexus 6P.

Step 4: Install SuperSU for root access

With TWRP customized recovery installed, you're now ready to flash SuperSU, which gives you full root access.

Download the SuperSU .zip file to your phone's internal storage and reboot your device to TWRP recovery. Once you are in TWRP recovery, tap on “Install,” then navigate to the SuperSU .zip file from your internal storage and confirm that you want to install it. Once done, tap “Reboot System.”

After your Nexus 6P has rebooted, you should have full root access, allowing you to install custom ROMs, tweaks, and mods that take your device's features and customization options to the next level.

Conclusion

By unlocking your Nexus 6P, you can unleash its full potential for customization. Custom ROMs, mods, and tweaks are just a few ways to take your device to the next level. With TWRP installed and SuperSU giving you full root access, the options are practically endless.

However, be aware that rooting your device will void its warranty and can have some security risks if you're not careful with what you install or do on your phone afterward. Always proceed with caution and read up on the latest guides and tutorials related to rooting your Nexus 6P before getting started.

Being a Nexus device, it is pretty easy to root the Huawei-made Nexus 6P. However, the process involves unlocking the bootloader of the handset that leads to a complete data loss, which can be cumbersome to many.
Nonetheless, if a complete data loss if not a big deal for you and are interested in rooting the Nexus 6P, check out the steps below.
Note: Since rooting the Nexus 6P will delete all your data, including your installed apps and their data, it is recommended that you create a backup of all your important data before proceeding with the steps below.
The below steps are only applicable for Nexus 6P running Android 6.0.1 or higher.
Step 1: You will first need to unlock the bootloader of your Nexus 6P. This can be done by following the steps here. Do not close the command prompt or the terminal window that you had opened during this process since it will be required in the later steps.
Step 2: Download TWRP recovery image file and SuperSU zip file for the Nexus 6P from below. Transfer them to the same “nexus” folder that you had created while unlocking the bootloader of the handset. Also, for simplicity’s sake, rename the TWRP image file name to “nexus.img”.

Step 3: If your Nexus 6P is in bootloader/fastboot mode, boot it back into Android. You can go through the initial set up and log in to your Google accounts if you wish to. Once that is done, connect the device to your PC and transfer the SuperSU zip file to its internal storage.
Step 4: Again switch off the handset and boot it into bootloader mode by pressing and holding the Volume down and Power key simultaneously. Once the 6P boots into bootloader mode, connect it to your PC.
Step 5: Verify that the handset is being detected on your PC by running the following command:

Step 8: Once TWRP boots up on your Nexus 6P, tap on ‘Install’ and then navigate and select the SuperSU zip file. The installation procedure will take less than a few seconds.

If TWRP prompts you to grant it permission to modify some system settings so that the recovery is not replaced at the next boot, make sure to swipe on yes.
Step 9: Proceed to reboot your device back into recovery by selecting the ‘Reboot system’ option. When prompted by TWRP to install SuperSU, make sure to select no.
Once your device boots back into Android, you should have the SuperSU app in your app drawer. To confirm whether you have root access on your Nexus 6P or not, you can use applications like Root Checker from Google Play.

Do note that since you have installed a custom recovery on your Nexus 6P, you will not be receiving direct OTA updates from Google. Instead, you will have to manually sideload them.
