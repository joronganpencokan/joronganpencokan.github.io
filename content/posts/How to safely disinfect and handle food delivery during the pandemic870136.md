# Protect Yourself from Deadly Germs! Learn How to Properly Disinfect and Handle Food Delivery Amidst the Pandemic!

The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about a new awareness of the importance of cleanliness and hygiene. Staying safe from the virus means taking extra precautions, especially when it comes to handling food delivery. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself from deadly germs while handling food during the pandemic.

## Check the Packaging

When receiving food delivery, the first thing you should do is check the packaging. If it’s damaged or torn, the food probably wasn’t delivered in a hygienic manner. Make sure the package is sealed and intact before handling it.

## Wash Your Hands

Before handling any food delivery, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. This will help to kill any germs that may be on your hands.

## Disinfect the Packaging

After washing your hands, it’s a good idea to disinfect the packaging. Use disinfectant wipes or spray to clean the exterior of the package. This will help to kill any germs that might have been transferred during transit.

## Remove the Food

Once you’ve disinfected the packaging, carefully remove the food from the container. Avoid touching any surfaces that may have been contaminated during transit. If possible, use a utensil to remove the food from the package.

## Heat the Food

Heating your food before eating it is an effective way to kill any germs that may be present. If you’re unsure about the temperature of the food, it’s always better to err on the side of caution and heat it up before eating it.

## Dispose of Packaging

After you’ve finished eating, be sure to dispose of the packaging properly. Place it in a plastic bag and tie it tightly before throwing it away. This way, you can prevent any germs from spreading.

In conclusion, protecting yourself from deadly germs during the pandemic is all about taking extra precautions and being vigilant about hygiene. Following these simple steps can help you stay safe while handling food delivery. Remember to always wash your hands, disinfect the packaging, heat your food, and dispose of the packaging properly. Stay safe and stay healthy!

It’s one thing to clean and disinfect an ordinary package, but what about perishable goods or those fresh food kits you order? Believe it or not, there are still ways to keep your food clean and enjoy it without stressing about germs.

 
## Clean hands, clean packaging, clean food?


Food delivery is on the rise thanks to the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. With social distancing and “flattening the curve” being nationwide priorities, people are dining in restaurants and gathering in groups less than ever.
But people still need to eat, which is why stocks for delivery companies like HelloFresh and Blue Apron are skyrocketing as the rest of the market falters. 
It’s a sign of the times and a good reason to look at some of the delivery options you can choose from. After all, ordering food kit deliveries can help you avoid unnecessary contact with others who may be asymptomatic.
Here are some of the most popular delivery options you can choose from right now, and what you’ll get when you decide to call in.
As good as these options are, it’s worth noting every kit is still being prepared and delivered by human hands. And since asymptomatic transmission is a major factor in the spread of COVID-19, even fresh deliveries should be properly cleaned and disinfected.

 
## How do I clean and disinfect my food kit deliveries?


A common question people have is whether COVID-19 can be transmitted via food. According to the CDC, there is no evidence food can infect you, but health officials still urge people to carefully clean packaging and to wash fruits and vegetables as a general precaution.
This is because we now understand the virus can live on surfaces for several days — up to 17 in some cases. Though frozen or refrigerated packaging does seem to harm the virus, you still want to sanitize everything.
You can’t be too careful when health is on the line, so here’s what you should do for any food delivery kits you receive to make sure they’re as clean as possible:

 
When you receive your package, wear gloves and wipe the box down with disinfecting wipes. Make sure you’re using chemicals that are known to kill the coronavirus. Tap or click here to see the list.Open the package and throw the box away. If it’s a shelf-stable item, wipe it down with a disinfectant and put it in a safe area separate from the rest of your food. Let it sit for 1-3 days.If your item is perishable, wipe down the container with disinfectant and put it in the refrigerator immediately. Try to isolate it from other items in your fridge. Wait 1-3 days, then wipe it down again before opening. Any fresh ingredients like fruits or vegetables should be carefully washed with soap immediately before storage.If the item is a fresh meal or something you need to eat right away, sanitize the container it came in and use clean kitchen utensils to transfer the food to a clean plate or bowl. Discard the containers.


As a precaution, you should handle any freshly delivered food with utensils instead of your hands. And health officials discourage putting your hands near your face, as it’s one of the most common vectors for infection.

 
## Touch-free goes mainstream


In the face of a pandemic like the one we’re experiencing, it’s likely more businesses will adapt and evolve to answer consumer needs. 
One company is taking the idea even further by introducing germ-free “airlocks” for food pickup. This ensures no human contact occurs during mealtime. 
Creator, a San Francisco-based restaurant, developed the pressurized “transfer chamber” for curbside pickup orders. To help other businesses, it’s made the design open source, so anyone with the know-how can build and make use of these germ-fighting devices. The plans can be downloaded for free from the company’s website.
All of these efforts go a long way toward flattening the curve and keeping our hospitals from overflowing. Before too long, we might even see delivery as the norm among some of the biggest retailers in the nation. Tap or click here to see Walmart’s plans for grocery delivery.
