# Unlock the Secret to Managing Your Own Git Repositories on Your Website And Boost Your Productivity!

If you're a web developer, you're probably familiar with Git, the most popular version control system in the world. Git is an essential tool for managing code repositories and tracking changes made to your website's source code. However, managing your own Git repositories can be a daunting task.

In this article, we will take a closer look at how to manage your own Git repositories on your website and boost your overall productivity.

## Why Use Git?

Before we can dive into managing Git repositories, let's first understand why using Git is so essential.

Git allows developers to keep track of all changes made to their code. This ensures that if something goes wrong, you can quickly revert to a previous working version of your code. Additionally, Git allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same code, which streamlines development and reduces errors.

## Managing Your Own Git Repositories

Now that we've established why Git is so essential let's explore how to manage Git repositories on your website.

1. **Choose a Hosting Provider**: The first step in managing your Git repositories is to choose a hosting provider. There are many options available, including GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.

2. **Create Your Repository**: Once you've chosen a hosting provider, the next step is to create your Git repository. The process will vary depending on which hosting provider you choose.

3. **Setup Git on Your Local Machine**: Before you start using Git, you'll need to set it up on your local machine. There are plenty of resources available online to guide you through this process.

4. **Connect Your Local Repository to Your Hosting Provider**: Once you've set up Git, you'll need to connect your local Git repository to your hosting provider. This will allow you to push changes made on your local machine to your remote repository.

5. **Push Changes to Your Remote Repository**: Once you've made changes to your local repository, you'll need to push those changes to your remote repository. This is done using Git commands such as "git push."

6. **Manage Access Control**: Finally, you'll need to manage access control to your Git repository by setting permissions for each collaborator.

## Boosting Your Productivity

Now that you know how to manage your own Git repositories let's explore some ways to boost your productivity.

1. **Automate Deployment**: Automating your deployment process with tools such as Jenkins or CircleCI can save time and reduce errors.

2. **Use Git Hooks**: Git Hooks are scripts that are run automatically whenever certain events occur in your Git repository. For example, you could use a Git Hook to automatically run tests whenever code is pushed to your remote repository.

3. **Use Branches**: Using branches in Git allows you to experiment with new features without disrupting the main branch. This can be a great way to test out new ideas while keeping the main branch stable.

4. **Collaborate Effectively**: Finally, make sure to collaborate effectively with your team. Use Git's built-in features such as pull requests and merge requests to streamline communication and reduce errors.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, managing your own Git repositories on your website is an essential task for any web developer. Git allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and streamline your development process. With the tips outlined in this article, you can boost your productivity and take your development skills to the next level. So what are you waiting for? Start managing your Git repositories today!

If you’re familiar with the Git revision control system, you’ve most likely heard of social software sites that use Git, such as GitHub, Gitorious, and Sourceforge. Those sites are great for collaboration, but what if you want to host a private Git repository on your own personal website?

GitList is a PHP frontend for Git that beautifies and simplifies browsing your Git repositories, and you can host it anywhere you want. Say goodbye to exorbitant fees for hosting your private repository; GitList is absolutely free, and due to its minimal dependencies, you can even run it on (some) shared Web hosting plans.
 

 
The interface surely looks familiar to you GitHub users out there! It’s quite slick and modern-looking compared to the clunkier interface of Gitweb, Git’s default Web frontend, and it comes packed with user-friendly features. Some of these include:
 
- Support for browsing multiple repositories
 - Multiple branch and tag support
 - RSS feeds
 - Syntax highlighting
 - Statistics on your repositories
 - Ease of installation compared to other Web-based Git frontends

 
## Requirements
 
As we mentioned earlier, you can install GitList on some shared Web hosting plans. You do need a couple of things on your remote server that not all shared hosting plans offer:
 
- Git
 - SSH access

 
Note that SSH access is not required to install GitList itself, but you will need it to create and manage your remote Git repositories from the command line.
 
In addition to those two items, you’ll need:
 
- Apache with mod_rewrite enabled or Nginx on your remote server
 - PHP 5.3.3 on your remote server
 - Git on your local machine

 
## Installation
 
Grab a tarball of the GitList code from the main page on GitList.org. You can choose between the latest stable release, which at the time of this writing is 0.3, or the development build. I chose the development build, but you can follow the same installation instructions in either case.
 
Extract the tarball into the directory on your site to which you want to install GitList – not to be confused with the directory your actual Git repositories are installed in, which we’ll get to in a little bit.
 
From now on, the instructions in this article will assume that you are logged in to your site via SSH. Enter your GitList directory and set 777 permissions to the “cache” subdirectory (create it if it doesn’t already exist):
 
Now move the file config.ini-example to config.ini:
 
Open config.ini for editing in one of the text editors available on your remote server. For example:
 
For this part, you must already have one or more Git repositories stored somewhere on your server. If you don’t, read the next section and then come back here.
 
Fill out the repositories section in the code with the full path of your Git project directory. If you don’t know the full path, you can cd into that directory and enter pwd; the output is the full path. In this case, my Git projects directory was called “gitprojects,” and it lived under the “git” subdirectory of my main site, so I typed in my path accordingly (folder structure may vary across Web hosts, so be cautious):
 
## Getting a Git Repository onto Your Server
 
Go ahead and skip this section if you have already set up your remote repositories. If not, here’s one way to do it.
 
First prepare a Git repository on your local machine. You can make a repository from any directory. For example, let’s say you have a folder called “turtles” with a few files in it:
 
Now SSH into your remote server to create and initialize a bare repository:
 
Return to your local machine and add a remote branch. It is customary to call it “origin,” but you can use whatever name you wish (using other names comes in handy if you are sharing the same files with multiple remote repositories). Follow the format of this example but change your file paths appropriately:
 
Now push your files to the remote server:
 
Ta-da! You now have a remote copy of your Git repository that you can browse with GitList. Don’t forget to put the parent directory’s path into your config.ini first.
 
## Securing Your Repository
 
If you’re concerned about keeping your repository away from prying eyes, I regret to tell you that GitList provides no built-in user authentication method. However, in most cases you can password-protect a directory straight from your website’s control panel. In cPanel, it’s right here in the “Security” section:
 
Alternatively, you can manually configure the Apache server to restrict access to particular users.
 
## Conclusion
 
Hosting your own repositories can be both empowering and budget-saving. Whether you’ve been using Git for a while or you’re in the beginning stages of curiosity about how you can benefit from version control, I urge you to give self-hosting and GitList a try – unless, of course, you’re totally content leaving the control of your content up to third parties.
