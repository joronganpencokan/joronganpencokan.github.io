# Unleash the Power of the Muckshake in Valheim with This Mind-Blowing Cauldron Upgrade!

Are you tired of running low on stamina while fighting beasts and mining resources in Valheim? Are you looking for a way to give yourself an edge in combat? Look no further than the muckshake – a powerful concoction that will give you the energy you need to thrive in the harsh world of Valheim.

The muckshake is a popular drink among Valheim players because it provides a temporary boost to your stamina, allowing you to swing your weapons and perform other actions for a longer period of time. To make a muckshake, you need to combine three different ingredients in a cauldron – raspberries, blueberries, and honey.

While the muckshake is already powerful on its own, it can be even more effective with the right cauldron upgrade. By upgrading your cauldron with the Fermenter, you can turn your muckshake into a potent brew that has even more impressive effects.

The Fermenter is a new addition to Valheim that was introduced in the Hearth and Home update. When you use the Fermenter on a cauldron filled with muckshake ingredients, it creates a new beverage called Blood Pudding. This beverage not only provides a boost to your stamina like muckshake, but it also increases your health and damage resistance.

To make Blood Pudding, you'll need to add two more ingredients to your muckshake mixture – thistle and bloodbag. Thistle can be found growing in the Black Forest biome, while bloodbags are harvested from the bodies of the creatures you defeat in Valheim.

While the Fermenter and Blood Pudding may require a bit more effort than simply crafting a muckshake, the benefits are well worth it. With Blood Pudding in your inventory, you'll be able to take on tougher enemies, survive longer in battles, and gather resources more effectively.

In conclusion, if you want to unleash the full power of the muckshake in Valheim, you need to upgrade your cauldron with the Fermenter. By doing so, you'll have access to the potent Blood Pudding beverage, which will provide you with the energy and durability you need to face even the toughest challenges. So get out there, gather your ingredients, and start brewing – the power of the muckshake awaits!


The Muckshake is a new food item that you can use in Valheim to give your stamina and health a boost after the Hearth and Home update. Not sure how to make it? Do you have to upgrade your Cauldron to get your hands on it? This quick guide will show you the way.
 
## How to Make a Muckshake in Valheim?
 

 
To make a Muckshake, you require a Cauldron which has to be at level 2 minimum. If you don’t have a Cauldron, don’t worry. You will need the Hammer to craft it and you also require a fire (like a hearth or campfire) to use it. The crafting materials required for a Cauldron are 10 Tin pieces and a Forge. Once you have placed it, you can prepare mead bases as well as some food items with it.
 
## How to Upgrade your Cauldron in Valheim?
 
To upgrade your Cauldron, you require three things:
 
- Spice Rack – 3 Dandelions, 2 Carrots, 5 Mushrooms, 3 Thistles, 3 Turnips
 - Butcher’s Table – 2 Ancient Bark, 4 Core Wood, 4 Fine Wood, 2 Silver
 - Pots and Pans – 5 Copper Bars, 5 Iron Bars, 5 Black Metal Bars, 10 Fine Wood

 
Craft these structures, place them near your Cauldron and upgrade it easily to unlock more food items and recipes.
 
If you already have one, then you need to look for the following ingredients for the Muckshake cooking recipe:
 
- 1 Ooze
 - 2 Raspberries
 - 2 Blueberries

 
### Where to Find these Materials?
 
- Ooze: To obtain Ooze, you must enter the Swamp biome and defeat the slimy enemies you encounter. Here’s our swamp survival guide to help you in your endeavors.
 - Raspberries: You can find Raspberries from random bushes when you visit the Meadows biome.
 - Blueberries: For Blueberries, you have to visit the Black Forest biome and find them in bushes over there.

 
So what you have to do is explore a lot and collect the necessary materials. Once you have all the resources, head to your Cauldron and start crafting. That’s pretty much all there is to it – make your Muckshake and drink it to get extra healing and stamina which will help you in your journey as a Viking.
