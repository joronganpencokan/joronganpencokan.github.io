# Game-Changing Device? We Tried Apple's Airtags, Here's What You NEED to Know!

Apple's latest release, the Airtags, has been the talk of the town for quite some time now. It is a tracking device that uses Apple's Find My network to help you locate your lost or stolen items. With several other tracking devices already on the market, the question that comes to our minds is, are these Airtags any different? We tested out the device, and here's what you need to know.

## First Impressions

The Airtags come in a small oval-shaped design, somewhat similar to a key fob. The Airtags are waterproof and have a replaceable battery, which can last up to a year. The device has an easy-to-use setup process, which is done through the Find My app. However, for those who do not own any Apple devices, this might be an issue as it is a prerequisite to have an iOS device to get started.

## Navigation

The Airtags are simple to navigate, with the Find My app allowing users to see the approximate location of their lost item on a map, as well as the distance between the user and the lost item. The app also provides a 'precision finding' feature that guides the user within a few feet of the lost item through haptic, audio, and visual feedback. This feature works flawlessly, and we found it to be incredibly useful.

## Limitations

One of the setbacks concerning the device is its compatibility with the Find My network. According to Apple, the tag can be detected within a range of 100 meters. However, the device's effectiveness varies depending upon the location, which means it might not be as useful in crowded areas, for example, a shopping mall or an airport.

Furthermore, the Airtags can only be used via the Find My app, which means that it cannot be integrated with other third-party apps. Apple also does not offer any anti-stalking measures, which means that someone might use the device to track your movements without your knowledge.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, the Airtags are an excellent addition to Apple's line of products. The device's design and functionality are user-friendly, and the precision finding feature is undoubtedly a game-changer. However, the device's limitations do raise concerns, especially regarding personal privacy and the Find My network's coverage range.

If you are an avid Apple user, then the Airtags might be a useful device to have. However, for those who do not rely solely on Apple products, the device's compatibility might be an issue. Regardless, it is still an impressive device, and we expect other companies to follow suit and come up with their versions of the tracking device.

Apple’s new AirTag is one of the coolest products the company has produced in a long time, and the surprising thing is it only costs $29. 

 
### 
Key Takeaways
 
- I’ve tested out Apple’s new AirTag, and I’m impressed with how well it works. The AirTag costs $29, or $99 for a pack of four, and is a great value considering the high price of other Apple products. AirTags work on Apple’s Find My network, so they can communicate with other Apple devices to alert you to their location.

 

Of course, I bought a pack of four for $99, but at least you have the option to go the less expensive route. That’s a change of pace for Apple, which is known as much for its high prices as its quality. But the AirTag is far more than just a cheap accessory, as it’s meant to help you keep track of your prized possessions.

 

The idea behind the AirTag is hardly novel. Products like Tile trackers and the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag have been out for a while, and offer the ability to find your stuff using Bluetooth. But as is often the case with Apple, the AirTags are more than just their specifications. 

 

For starters, the AirTags are incredibly easy to use if you’re already an Apple user. I tore open the package and had my AirTag paired with my iPhone 12 Pro Max within seconds. I pulled a plastic tab off the battery compartment and held the tag next to my phone. The AirTag was discovered instantly, and all I had to do was choose from a list of names that described where I was likely to use it.

 
For now, I’m pretty sure I won’t lose my car key.
 
##   I Once Was Lost  
 

I might be the perfect customer for the AirTag as I lose things constantly. One of my chief anxieties in life is losing the key to my Toyota Highlander. As I discovered recently, if you lose the electronic key fob necessary to get your car moving, replacing it can cost nearly $1,000 and take up to a week. 

 

So, my first mission was to attach the AirTag to my car key, made possible by the Apple AirTag Leather Key Ring. I ordered this ring at the same time as my AirTags in a lovely shade of “Baltic Blue.” It’s a nice piece of kit, but I’ve never spent $35 on a key ring before. 

 

AirTags are small and portable, making them very easy to keep on a keychain or wallet. At 1.25 inches wide and 0.31 inches thick, they look like tiny flying saucers engraved with an awesome Apple logo. 

 

Once paired, it was time to play hide and seek with the key and AirTag around my apartment. I stashed the key in a drawer and pretended I had forgotten where I left it.

 
##   But Now I’m Found  
 

AirTags work on Apple’s Find My network so they can communicate with other Apple devices, even those that aren’t yours, to alert you to their location. If there’s an iPhone, even if it's not your own, within the Bluetooth range of your AirTag, you'll be able to see where it is. Apple claims that even if a random iPhone detects your AirTag, the owner won’t know about it even when the information is passed back to you. 

 

During my recent test, I wasn’t going far from my AirTag, so it didn’t have to tap into strange iPhones. I was only about 40 feet away when I tried the Find My app, and my key was found almost instantly on the map.

 

Once I moved within about 30 feet of my keys, I was within Bluetooth range, and that’s when  precision tracking kicked in. This feature uses a U1 chip in your iPhone and AirTag to get a precise location. The nice part is the iPhone shows you directions to where your item is located. In practice, I found the tracking was accurate to less than a foot. Pretty good!

 

However, there were a couple of times when my iPhone couldn’t seem to find the AirTag as I got closer. That’s when I triggered the alarm sound, which was loud and high pitched enough to penetrate through layers of clothing and Ikea furniture. 

 
At 1.25 inches wide and 0.31 inches thick, they look like tiny flying saucers.
 

Overall, the AirTag has been a delight to use. I’ve only had it a short time, but I’m looking forward to giving it a long-term test. For now, I’m pretty sure I won’t lose my car key.
