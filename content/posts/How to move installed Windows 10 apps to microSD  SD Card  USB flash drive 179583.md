Introduction:

Are you running out of space on your Windows 10 PC? One of the reasons could be the bloated apps and games that take up a lot of storage. The good news is that you can easily move them to an external device like MicroSD, SD card or USB flash drive.

In this article, we will guide you on how to do it using the Hugo writing format, step-by-step.

Step 1: Insert your External Device

The first step in moving an app or game to an external device is to insert it. If you're using a MicroSD, SD card, or USB flash drive, plug it into your device. If you're using a USB, make sure it has enough storage space to accommodate the apps you want to move.

Step 2: Open Settings App

Click the "Start" button and select the "Settings" option (gear icon).

Step 3: Open System and Storage Settings

In the Settings app, click on the "System" option, and then click on "Storage."

Step 4: Choose Apps and Features

In the Storage, click on "Apps and Features." Here you will see installed apps and games on your device.

Step 5: Select the App You Want to Move

Choose the app you want to move to the external device. It will display the space it is currently taking up on your device.

Step 6: Click on Move

After selecting the app you want to move, click on the "Move" option. It will display "Move to a different drive."

Step 7: Choose the External Device

Click on the external device you inserted earlier from the dropdown. If you have multiple external devices, select the correct one.

Step 8: Click on Move

After selecting the external device, click on the "Move" button.

Step 9: Wait for the Transfer

Now, wait for a few minutes to complete the transfer. It will take some time depending on the size of the app or game and the transfer speed.

Step 10: Restart the App or Game

After the transfer is complete, you will see that the app or game is now moved to the external device. You can now remove the external device and restart the app or game from there whenever you want to use it.

Conclusion:

Moving apps and games to external devices like MicroSD, SD card or USB flash drive is easy and will free up space on your device. By following these simple steps, you can easily move apps and games that are taking up too much space on your Windows 10 device. You won't believe how easy and fast it is to do, so try it out now!

Although there are a vast of Windows 10 apps that are reasonable small, many can take up hundreds of megabytes, or even gigabytes, when we count game installments.
 
Nowadays storage is cheap and in many cases isn’t a problem for many computers. However, there are devices, such as affordable laptops and tablets that typically come with limited storage capacity. Simply installing a few apps and a couple of games can quickly fill up the entire hard drive.
 
On Windows 10, Microsoft has improved the operating system to handle apps and games storage. Now it’s possible to easily move those apps installed on your computer to another SD Card, microSD, USB flash drive, or external hard drive.
 
In this guide, you’ll learn the steps to quickly move Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps to another location to free up space in your laptop or tablet will limited space.
 
## How to move apps to another drive
 
- Use the Windows key + I keyboard shortcut to open the Settings app.
 - Click System.
 - Click Apps & features.
 - Select the app or game you want to move to another drive, and click the Move button.
 - Pick the drive to move the app from the drop-down menu and click Move to confirm the move.

 
When moving apps to another location, it’s a good idea to use a dedicated drive that you’ll not disconnect. In addition, Windows 10 won’t fail when disconnecting the drive, but apps won’t run until you reconnect it. (If you disconnect the drive when launching an app, then the app will get corrupted, and reinstall will be required.)
 
Use the Windows key + I keyboard shortcut to open the Settings app.
 
Click System.
 
Click Apps & features.
 
Select the app or game you want to move to another drive, and click the Move button.
 
Pick the drive to move the app from the drop-down menu and click Move to confirm the move.
 

 
In the case you want to move an app that doesn’t support this feature, you could alternatively change the default install location. Then uninstall the app you want to move, and reinstall it again from the Store. This way the app will now install automatically in the new location, but depending on the app, you may lose app data.
 
## Wrapping things up
 
You will find this feature particularly useful when you have a laptop or tablet with limited disk space, and you have available a microSD or SD Card slot to add more storage. Or when you have a gaming PC, and you want to install all your games you bought from the Windows Store to a different location other than your main drive.
 
It’s important to note that this process also works with Windows 10 Mobile, but the settings are in a different location: Settings > System > Storage > This PC > Apps & games.
 
Finally, keep in mind that not all Windows 10 apps support this feature. For example, built-in apps, traditional desktop applications, and certain other apps cannot be moved.
