Are you unable to watch your favorite Netflix TV show on a rainy Sunday afternoon? Irritating huh? If you are facing issues like too many people are using your account while streaming then definitely you need to see who all are using your Netflix account. There is a limit to the number of users who can stream at the same time depending on your plan.
 
If you see that users have logged in to your Netflix account from devices that you never used or from locations where you were never present, then it is time to sign out of all devices which will kick someone off Netflix account if not everyone. And after that even change your Netflix password so that no one can log in again.
 
Here are the detailed steps you should follow. First, you will learn how to kick someone off Netflix, then, how to change your password. And finally, I will show how to see who’s using your Netflix account. 
 
## How To Kick Someone Off Netflix Account
 
Using this method you can sign out of all devices and change the Netflix password to keep your account safe.
 
1. Log in to your Netflix account and again go to the Account screen by hovering over the account avatar at the top right and select Account.
 
2. Click on Sign out of all devices under Settings.
 
3. Finally, click on Sign out to confirm. It may take up to 8 hours to log out from all devices. Please note that it will log out for the whole account so all the screens will be affected too if you have a multi-screen subscription.
 
After doing this, you got your Netflix account removed from other devices. 
 
Now, it is time to change the Netflix password. This is to make sure no one can log in again (in case they have your login password).

## How To Check If Someone Is Using Your Netflix Account
 
### My Problem With Sharing Netflix
 
Like most of you, I also gave my Netflix credentials to a few friends and family members. However, after a month it turned out to be a mess with all those irrelevant TV shows and Movies in Continue Watching list and other recommendations. You can always delete items from the Continue Watching queue whenever desired but it is irritating to have to remove them all the time.
 
Moreover, while trying to watch a series I started getting error messages like:
 
- Sorry, too many people are using your account right now.Your Netflix account is in use on too many devices.

 
This was because there is a limit of 2-4 devices which can access the account at the same time. Now, if you are facing similar issues then you can get to know who is using your Netflix account.
 
### When And Where Was Your Netflix Account Used?
 
1. Log in to your Netflix account and select the desired screen if you have a multi-screen subscription.
 
2. Hover over on your account thumbnail at the top right corner and select Account.
 
3. At the bottom click on Viewing Activity under My Profile.
 
4. Under My Activity, if you see there are TV shows or movies listed which you never watched or opened then definitely someone else has used it.
 
Even if all shows that are shown are opened by you, it is better to check from where your account was accessed and the device used for the same. For that, go back to the Account screen and click on Recent device streaming activity in the Settings section.
 
There you go! You will get a detailed list showing Date & Time, Location, device and even the IP address from which your account was accessed.
 
With this, you can easily make out if your account is compromised or not. If there are shows and devices that you recognize then all is good. But if you come across through any suspected device, it’s better to remove them from your Netflix account. Here’s how.
