After several teasers and narrative trailers, Halo Infinite finally gets ready to show its campaign gameplay at the Xbox Series X event scheduled for this July 23.
 
According to its official blog, the developer 343 Industries makes it known that the latest addition to the Halo series, Halo Infinite, will be shown during the Xbox Game Showcase on July 23rd through a presentation of the single-player campaign.
 
We must, therefore, expect a gameplay reveal that will finally manage to make us touch the first title of the saga belonging to the next generation, as well as perhaps a new trailer. The news takes on particular interest if we think that for some time it has been rumored that the single and multiplayer sectors of Halo Infinite could have two distinct releases, which would confirm the different approach to the work adopted by 343 Industries and announced during E3 2018.
 
You’ll be able to catch the show on Xbox.com and pretty much everywhere else you may expect, including Xbox’s Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.
 
We’ll see you in two weeks.
 
Probably some game elements from the world of the new Halo Infinite will be shown, whereby of course the new environments and characters will also play an important role.
 
Halo fans are eagerly awaiting the reunion with Atriox and how this can be linked to the story. The teaser message has already generated a lot of interest, and one or the other teaser trailer will surely be released in the coming days.
 
The show will start on July 23, 2020, so mark this date in your calendar.
