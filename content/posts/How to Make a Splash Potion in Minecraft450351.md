- If you want to create a poison potion, add a Spider Eye.

- If you want to create a potion of fire resistance, add a Magma Cream.

- If you want to create a potion of strength, add Blaze Powder.

4. After adding your desired ingredients, you must add Gunpowder to the mix. This will turn your potion into a splash potion.

5. Voila! You have created the ultimate splash potion in Minecraft!
