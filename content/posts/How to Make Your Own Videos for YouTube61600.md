# Unleash Your Inner Filmmaker: Learn the Secrets to Creating Viral YouTube Videos!

Are you dreaming of making it big on YouTube? Do you want to know how to make videos that go viral and get millions of views? If so, then you're in the right place! In this article, we'll show you the secrets to creating viral YouTube videos that will help you grow your channel and keep your audience coming back for more.

## Develop a Concept

The first step to creating a viral video is to have a great concept. What is your video going to be about? Will it be funny, informative, or inspirational? You need to nail down your concept before you start filming so that you can make sure your video has a clear purpose and message.

## Write a Script

Next, write a script for your video. Even if you're making a vlog-style video, having a rough script will help keep you on track and ensure that you get all of your points across. Keep in mind that the average viewer has a short attention span, so make sure your script is engaging and holds their interest.

## Plan Your Shots

Once you have your script, it's time to plan your shots. Make a shot list that outlines every shot you need for your video. This will help you stay organized and make sure you get all of the footage you need. Your shot list should include the type of shot you need (i.e. wide shot, close-up, etc.), the location, and any specific actions that need to be captured.

## Invest in Good Equipment

If you want your videos to look professional, then you need to invest in good equipment. A DSLR or mirrorless camera, a tripod, and a good microphone can do wonders for the quality of your videos. Don't forget about lighting either! Even if you're filming outside, good lighting can make a big difference.

## Edit Your Footage

After you've filmed your footage, it's time to edit it all together. Use a good editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro to piece everything together. Make sure your video flows well and that your music and sound effects are well balanced with your dialogue.

## Promote Your Video

Finally, it's time to promote your video! Share your video on social media and make sure you include relevant hashtags. If you have a mailing list, send out an email blast promoting your new video. You can also reach out to other YouTubers and ask if they would be willing to promote your video to their audience.

In conclusion, creating viral YouTube videos takes time and effort, but it can be done! Follow these tips and you'll be on your way to growing your channel and creating engaging content that your audience will love. Happy filming!

This article explains how to make, edit, and post videos on YouTube.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- First, create and edit video content, then set up a YouTube account.Upload video: On YouTube, select the Camcorder icon. Next, add details, such as title or description.Share video: Email link or embed link on your website or blog. Create playlists, if desired.

 
##   Get Footage for Your YouTube Video  
 

The first requirement in making a YouTube video is to have footage. Your content can be something original that you shoot with your phone, camera, or webcam. It might be aÂ commercial, an old home movie, or a montage of photos you've taken.

 

It's a good idea to connect an external microphone to your recording device before recording. Using a good mic is one of the top audio tips to help you avoid poor sound quality.

 
##   Edit Your Video  
 

Editing is optional, but a good idea if you want to make your video more compelling or easier to follow. You'll probably want to keep most of your video, but there will be other sections (maybe even just a few seconds) that you want to delete from the footage.

 
Make sure that the video content is yours and not owned by someone else. YouTube has a Content ID process that notifies them when you upload content that may violate known copyrights.
 

Instead of reshooting the whole video, you can use some free editing software to remove the sections you don't want.

 
##   Set Up a YouTube Account  
 

You need to have a free user account with Google before you can create a YouTube account/channel and upload videos to YouTube. If you already use Gmail, Google Photos, or any of Google's other services, you can use this information to create your YouTube channel.

 
##   Make Sure Your Video Is the Correct Size and Format for YouTube  
 

YouTube accepts a wide variety of video formats and resolution sizes, so you don't have to be too concerned with upload settings. A larger, higher quality file will look better on YouTube, but a smaller file will upload faster.

 

The supported YouTube file formats include MP4, AVI, FLV, WMV, MOV, WebM, and others. If your video isn't in one of these formats, you can always use a free video file converter to save it to one that YouTube supports.

 

Since YouTube's videos display at a 16:9 aspect ratio, any other video size will have black boxes on either side to make up for that incorrect ratio. Encode your video in one of these resolutions to make it work best.

 

The maximum file size you for a YouTube video is 128 GB, which is huge and should not be a problem for most uploads.

 
##   Verify Your YouTube Account  
 

You have to verify your YouTube account to upload content that's longer than 15 minutes.

 
##   Upload Your Video to YouTube and Add Details  
 

You're now ready to upload your video! Log in to your YouTube account and click the camcorder icon at the top of the screen to start the upload process.

 

Depending on the size of your video file, the process may be quick or slow. While you're waiting, you can enter information about your video such as the title, description, thumbnail, and more. The more information you include, the easier it will be for people to find your video.

 

You can also add promotional elements directly from YouTube to your video.

 
##   Share Your YouTube Video  
 

Once your video is uploaded to YouTube, you can share it by emailing the video link to email recipients or embedding it on your website or blog. If you want to keep your video private, you can do that, too.

 

You can also put your videos into playlists for an easy way to categorize them and even share multiple productions at the same time.
