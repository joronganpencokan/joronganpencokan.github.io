Unleash Your Inner Warrior: Master the Secrets of Leveling Up Fast in Fire Emblem Engage!

Are you tired of being stuck at the same level for hours on end while playing Fire Emblem Engage? Do you want to know the secrets to leveling up fast and unlocking new abilities and powers for your characters? Well, look no further! In this article, we will reveal some of the best tips and tricks to help you unleash your inner warrior and rise to the top of the game.

1. Focus on leveling up your core team members first

When starting a new game of Fire Emblem Engage, it's important to focus on leveling up your core team members first. This includes the characters that you'll be using the most during battles. By leveling up your core team members, you'll be able to tackle tougher enemies and complete missions more efficiently. You can also rotate out lesser-used characters to give them experience, but be sure to prioritize your main team.

2. Utilize the weapon triangle system

The weapon triangle system in Fire Emblem Engage is a critical aspect of the game that you shouldn't overlook. It's essential to understand how this system works and to use it to your advantage. The weapon triangle consists of swords (beats axes), axes (beats lances), and lances (beats swords). This system can give you a significant advantage in battles and help you level up faster.

3. Take advantage of the support system

The support system in Fire Emblem Engage is an excellent way to level up your characters faster. Characters can support each other by standing near each other during battles, and over time, their support levels will increase. Once a character's support level reaches a certain point, they'll gain access to support conversations that grant significant bonuses to their stats.

4. Stay aware of enemy weaknesses

Just as you should be aware of the weapon triangle system, you should also pay attention to the enemy's weaknesses. For example, if you're facing an enemy with a bow, you'll want to avoid sending in a character with low defense. Instead, you should use a character with a high defense and resistance to take down the enemy quickly.

5. Take advantage of class changes

As you level up your characters, you'll be able to change their classes to unlock new abilities and powers. This can significantly increase your chances of winning battles and leveling up faster. Be sure to research which classes are best suited for your characters, and plan your strategy around these class changes.

In conclusion, Fire Emblem Engage is an exciting and challenging game that requires strategy and tactical prowess. By following these tips, you can unleash your inner warrior and level up fast, unlocking new abilities and powers for your characters. So, what are you waiting for? It's time to take on the world of Fire Emblem Engage and emerge victorious!

## How to Level Up Fast in Fire Emblem Engage
 

 
Here are some ways to upgrade or level up fast in FE Engage:
 
### Standard Training Between Battles
 
You can take on different standard training at the Arena in Somniel. Over here, you can train with random units or your allies for Mock Battles. While it costs nothing to take on Standard training, it can increase your Skill Points (SP) and Experience points (EXP). If you grind at the training regularly, it can effectively give a boost to your EXP. But you can take on this training only three times a day. You can complete the standard training between battles to increase your EXP and for practicing out.
 
### Marth’s Mercurius Weapon
 
You will find several Emblems that will join your units as you progress in FE Engage. Marth is an Emblem that will join your party early in the game. One of his weapons has the passive effect of doubling your EXP. For that, you need to increase the Bond level to a maximum of level 10. We suggest prioritizing leveling up the bond with him as soon as you unlock him for this boost. Once you unlock the Mercurius weapon, try to use it in most battles to farm EXP.
