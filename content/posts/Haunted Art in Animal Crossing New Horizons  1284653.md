# You Won't Believe the Spooky Secret Lurking in Animal Crossing New Horizons' Art Collection!

If you're a fan of the Animal Crossing New Horizons game, you've probably come across Redd's Treasure Trawler, a mysterious boat selling unique art pieces. While some players might appreciate the opportunity to decorate their homes with rare paintings and sculptures, others have started to notice something strange about the art collection. 

According to some gamers, some of the artwork in Animal Crossing New Horizons contains hidden messages or dark secrets that only reveal themselves after closer inspection. It's said that these clues are almost invisible to the naked eye and require a keen attention to detail to uncover. But what are these secrets, and why are they so spooky?

One of the most notorious pieces in the Animal Crossing New Horizons art collection is the "Twinkling Painting," which depicts a night sky with stars and a crescent moon. While it might seem like a lovely addition to your island's museum, some players have noticed that the painting contains a hidden message. When viewed at the right angle, the stars form the letters "I-C-U." This message is both eerie and cryptic and has left many players wondering about its meaning. 

Another creepy artwork in the collection is the "Wistful Painting," which shows a woman in a flowing dress holding a fan. The majority of players wouldn't give this piece a second thought, but those with a keen eye have noticed that the woman's face is slightly distorted. It's as if her face is melting, with one eye larger than the other, and her chin slightly drooping. This slight distortion is enough to give players the chills, and some believe that it's a deliberate design choice to create an unsettling atmosphere. 

Last but not least is the "Quaint Painting," which features a friendly-looking frog sitting on a small mushroom. While it might seem harmless, some players have discovered that the mushroom is in the shape of an Amanita Muscaria, a type of mushroom that is highly poisonous. This small detail might seem insignificant, but it's enough to make players wonder about the intent behind the artwork. 

In conclusion, the Animal Crossing New Horizons art collection hides more secrets than meets the eye. While some players might appreciate the added mystique, others might find the spooky subtext unsettling. It's up to each player to decide whether they want to stick to the safer decor options or take a closer look at the hidden messages in the art collection. Either way, the Animal Crossing New Horizons game continues to provide surprises and twists that keep players on their toes.

If you have bought some fake art or fake paintings from Jolly Redd, the Fox who came to your island in his Treasure Trawler, chances are that some of it is haunted. It’s true. If you were initially worrying about Redd unknowingly buying fake art, now you have to worry about it being haunted too.
 
Yikes.
 
Some of the fake paintings and art brought in by Redd have shown signs of ghostly behavior. How? The people in the paintings are blinking, smiling and, well, creeping us out.
 
## ACNH Haunted Paintings
 
Some players are noticing that quite a few of the artworks change when you look at them and then they revert to their original state later in the day. Twitter user @absoluteowten posted a video about this as proof, check it out:

Very spooky and kind of terrifying. Where did you get these from, Jolly Redd?!
 
That’s not all. Apart from haunted art, there is also a haunted statue that we know of. It starts floating in the air when you interact with the statue. Watch it levitate below.

If this wasn’t scary enough, some of it even glows!
 
i’m not sure if the real informative statue does this but my fake one glows at night ? pic.twitter.com/jBlEjDSLJF

All of these freaky encounters have actually encouraged players to buy some fake art from Jolly Redd intentionally, just to see just how haunted it is! Honestly, it sounds like a great idea and we might do the same thing.
 
Currently, the Nature Day event is underway in Animal Crossing New Horizons.More events like the May Day Tour (starting today, May 1), International Museum Day and Wedding Season will take place soon. There’s also Leif the Sloth who has brought shrubs to your island, so make sure that you are unlocking hedges and shrubs in ACNH.
