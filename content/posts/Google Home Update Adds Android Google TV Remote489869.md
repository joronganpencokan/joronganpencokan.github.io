Things just got even better for Android TV users as Google Home's latest update revolutionizes the way we interact with our living room setups. With this update, users can now seamlessly control their Android TV using voice commands using Google Home. Whether you want to adjust the volume, playback your favorite movie or TV show, or even switch to a different channel, it's all possible with the latest update.

This new feature is a major game-changer for those who value convenience, simplicity, and technology. Google Home's voice-recognition capabilities allow users to easily find and play their favorite content without ever needing to leave the couch. That's a revolutionary change for the way we interact with our living room setups.

It doesn't matter whether you are an Android TV aficionado or someone who is just trying to get into smart home living. Google Home's latest update allows users to easily control their Android TV with simple voice commands, even if they don't have any technical experience.

The best part is that this update is available to anyone who has a compatible Android TV and a Google Home device. There are no additional subscriptions or services that users need to purchase, just the Google Home device itself.

So, how can you get started with this new feature? First, ensure that your Android TV is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your Google Home device. Then, just download the Google Home app from the Play Store if you haven't already, and set up your devices. Once both devices are connected, you're good to go.

Using voice commands with Google Home is simple. Simply say, "Okay Google" followed by the command you want. For example, you can say, "Okay Google, Play Stranger Things on Netflix" or just "Okay Google, pause" when you need to make a quick pause.

Overall, this latest update from Google Home is a game-changer, as it allows users to easily control their Android TV with simple voice commands. The ability to control your living room setup without even needing to pick up a remote control is an experience that will change the way you watch TV. Now let's make a bowl of popcorn and enjoy your favorite movie.

The days of relying on clunky physical remote controls are slowly crawling to an end.

 

Google just rolled out a dedicated Android/Google TV remote control app as part of its Google Home 2.46 update, according to 9to5Google. Those who own an Android/Google TV or Chromecast device will no longer need to use a packed-in remote, which is always nice.

 

The dedicated remote control does everything you expect, including navigating via swipe and offering quick mute and volume adjustment capabilities. You can also use a keyboard to type in lengthy passwords and search bar terms. 

 

The Google TV app already includes a remote control option, but having it as part of the overall Google Home ecosystem should be more convenient for many users. Google TV also received a minor update this week that alerts users when their favorite content is available to watch for free. 

 

Other than the remote, Google Home 2.46 is a relatively bare-bones update, with fixes for several bugs and some general performance improvements, as listed at APKMirror.

 

The remote control was released today for Android users via the Play Store. However, Apple users will have to wait a bit since the iOS version of Google Home 2.46 does not include the remote feature. It will be included in a future update.
