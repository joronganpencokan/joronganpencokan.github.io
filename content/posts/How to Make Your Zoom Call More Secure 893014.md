In the era of remote work and virtual meetings, Zoom has become a popular platform for conducting business meetings, webinars, and online classes. However, the rise in virtual meetings has also led to a surge in virtual crime, including Zoom hacking. Cybercriminals can hack into Zoom calls for various reasons, such as stealing confidential information, recording calls, or interrupting the meeting with malicious intent. In this article, we will explore some essential tips to boost your security and keep your Zoom calls safe from hackers.

Use Strong Passwords

The first and most crucial step to secure your Zoom call is to set a strong password. When scheduling the meeting, enable the password protection feature and ensure that it is a complex password containing a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. This will make it difficult for attackers to guess or brute-force your password and infiltrate your Zoom call.

Avoid Sharing Meeting Links Publicly

Avoid publishing Zoom meeting links publicly, as it can make it easy for hackers to gain access to the call. When sending invitations, use a secure communication channel such as email or encrypted messaging platforms. Also, do not share meeting links on social media platforms or any other public forums.

Enable Waiting Room

Enabling the waiting room feature adds an extra layer of security by allowing the host to control who enters the meeting. When a participant attempts to join the call, they will first need to wait in the virtual waiting room until the host grants permission to enter the meeting. This feature can help prevent unauthorized users from accessing the meeting.

Disable Screen Sharing for Participants

One of the most common Zoom hacking techniques is screen-sharing. Cybercriminals can gain control of the meeting by sharing inappropriate content or disruptive videos on-screen. To prevent this, the host should disable screen sharing for participants and only allow the host to share the screen during the meeting.

Utilize the Latest Version of Zoom

Zoom releases security patches and updates regularly to fix potential security flaws and vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is essential to keep Zoom updated to the latest version to ensure the most secure virtual meeting experience.

Conclusion

In conclusion, securing your Zoom meeting is paramount to avoid falling victim to cyberattacks and virtual crimes. By using strong passwords, avoiding sharing meeting links publicly, enabling the waiting room, disabling screen sharing for participants, and utilizing the latest version of Zoom, you can ensure your virtual meetings remain safe and secure. Remember, taking these necessary precautions can help protect your sensitive information and prevent unwanted hackers from accessing your Zoom call.

Zoom has gotten a lot of press lately due to privacy and security concerns. If you are one of those who were affected by the Zoombombing issue, the following are are some ways you can make your Zoom call more secure.
 
## Register your users
 
One way to dissuade hackers and make Zoom more secure is to require the participants to register for the meeting upon entering. They will need to make a password as well.
 
To enable this feature, tick the box next to Registration. If the meeting you are scheduling is recurring, you can choose whether the participants need to register each time or enter based on a one-time registration.
 
## Require a Password
 
Having your meeting password protected is your best and easiest way to protect your meeting.
 
Once you’ve made a password, you may not want to embed the password in your invitation because anyone who gets their hands on the invitation will also have the password. Send the password separately to your participants.
 
## Don’t let others join before you do
 
The “Join before host” feature allows a participant to join the meeting before you officially start it. It’s disabled by default, but check the tick box just in case.
 
## Use the Waiting Room
 
Using a “Waiting room” is a backup in case someone has obtained the link and password to your meeting. The waiting room keeps participants in this holding area until you approve their participation.
 
## Use Unique Meeting ID
 
Each Zoom user has a default meeting ID they can use, and if someone gets ahold of that number, they could use it to enter any meeting you have. Choose to use a random Meeting ID instead.
 
## Added security during meetings
 
Once your meeting is underway, there are a few other options you can enable or disable for more security to make Zoom more secure.
 
### Lock the meeting
 
When your meeting is underway and you are sure all the participants are there, you can lock the session. Click the Security button at the bottom of the Zoom video window and select the “Lock meeting” option at the top of the box.
 
### Remove Participant options
 
Also, there are options for the participants to share their screens or chat in the security box. You can remove these privileges as you see fit. Removing the opportunity to share screens will make it almost impossible for a guest to share an inappropriate video or image. Eliminating chat will take away the chance for one guest to bully or be improper with a particular participant.
 
## What to do if unwanted guests appear?
 
No matter how much security you put into place, it is always possible for someone determined to get into your meeting to do so. Be vigilant, and if you notice someone misbehaving, use one (or all) of these measures to take care of the problem.
 
### Mute them
 
If someone is just causing a disruption, or if their background noise is causing a distraction, you can find their name on the participant list and click the microphone to mute them. They’ll still be in the meeting, but they cannot be heard. You can mute their video, too, if what they are doing is distracting.
 
### Send to the waiting room
 
You can also take someone from the meeting and place them back in the waiting room, giving them a virtual Time Out. Click “Manage participants” at the bottom of the screen, then hover your mouse over the person’s name and click more. Select “Put in waiting room.”
 
### Remove them
 
You can remove someone from the meeting entirely, too. Use the same menu you use to send people to the waiting room but choose Remove. After, lock down the meeting if it wasn’t already so they cannot return.
 
Unfortunately, we know that if someone wants to get into your meeting and has the skills to do it, they can. However, if you take as many precautions as possible, you can make Zoom more secure, and you can enjoy Zoom calls to keep in touch with family, friends, and colleagues.
 
Zoom also comes with plenty of features you should try. You can also use Skype for your video conferencing if you are concerned about Zoom’s security issue.
