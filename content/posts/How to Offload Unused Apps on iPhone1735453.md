The Shocking Truth About iPhone Apps Taking Up Precious Space – And How To Instantly Offload Them!

Let's face it – we live in a world where mobile applications have become an essential part of our daily lives. We use them for communication, entertainment, business, and so much more. New apps are developed every day, and we can't seem to get enough of them. However, the more apps we install, the more space they take up on our iPhones. This often leads to storage issues and a slow-performing device. In this article, we reveal the shocking truth about iPhone apps taking up precious space and how to instantly offload them.

The truth is, most iPhone users have less storage space than they think they do. The amount of space on an iPhone is no longer solely determined by its capacity but also by the number of apps and files taking up space. According to several studies, the average iPhone user has around 80 apps installed on their device. That's a lot of apps! And with time, many of these apps become redundant, outdated, or simply irrelevant.

The problem with having too many apps on your iPhone is that they take up space, and storage space is a valuable resource. If your phone is consistently running out of storage space, it can cause your device to slow down, glitch, or even crash. Moreover, having too many apps can impact your iPhone's battery life, as some apps use battery power even when they're not in use.

The good news is that there's a simple and effective solution to this problem – offloading apps. Offloading an app means removing the app from your device but keeping its data and settings so that you can reinstall it later if needed. This feature is available in iOS 11 or later and can be accessed by going to Settings > General > iPhone Storage. You can then select the app you want to offload and tap "Offload App." This will remove the app from your device but keep its data and settings intact.

Another benefit of offloading apps is that it can free up significant amounts of space on your device. When you offload an app, it removes the app itself but not its data. For example, if you offload a game, you'll free up space used by the actual game app, but your high scores and progress will be saved in iCloud. This means that you can always reinstall the app in the future and pick up right where you left off.

In conclusion, iPhone apps taking up precious space is a harsh reality that all users need to face. If left unchecked, this can lead to slow performance, battery drain, and other issues. By offloading apps, you can free up significant amounts of space on your device while keeping your data and settings intact. So, take a few minutes to go through your apps and offload those that are no longer needed. It's an easy and effective way to keep your device running smoothly and avoid storage-related headaches.

##   What Does It Mean to Offload an App on an iPhone?  
 

The iPhone optimizes storage space with a three-pronged strategy. Users can trash documents and files, remove an app with all its data, or offload an app. The Offload Unused Apps feature is a nice compromise when you want to free up space taken up by an app but keep its data. 

 

Select General > iPhone Storage.

 

Go to Offload Unused Apps and select Enable. 

 

Go through the list of apps and choose an app to offload manually. In this example, we'll use the Google Assistant app.

If anyone asks, “Does offloading an app free up space?” the answer is yes. 

 

Offloading an app is different from deleting an app on an iPhone. The Offload Unused Apps feature frees up the storage used by the apps but keeps all documents and data intact. It helps you avoid the monotony of configuring an app from scratch. The app's icon and user data will remain on the iPhone. The icon will display a cloud with a downward arrow. When you want to use it again, tap the icon and download it again.

 

Storage space is necessary to keep iOS updated. So, this feature working under the hood gives you the flexibility to uninstall apps without losing data. As it only removes unused apps, you shouldn’t miss them too much. 

 
##   Reinstating the Offloaded App  
 

When you download the app again, it should be available on the App Store. You also might have to sign in again with your username and password if required. An offloaded app displays the usual icon but not the cloud icon in Spotlight.

 

Tap the icon to launch the app from the search results, and iOS will display an alert that you’re trying to open an app that is not currently installed. Tap OK to download the app. There’s no download progress indicator, so you have to go to the last known location of the app.
