# Unlock Faster Travels & Pack More Heat - Master the Art of Campfire Travel in Horizon Forbidden West!

Horizon Forbidden West is an exhilarating action-packed game that takes you on an epic adventure through a treacherous post-apocalyptic world. As you journey through the land, you will encounter all kinds of challenges – from ferocious beasts and hostile tribes to treacherous terrain and environmental hazards. But fear not, for there is a way to unlock faster travels and pack more heat – by mastering the art of campfire travel.

Campfire travel is a unique feature in Horizon Forbidden West that allows you to teleport between different campfires scattered throughout the game world. This feature not only saves you a lot of time and effort, but it also helps you to explore the game world more efficiently and strategically. So how do you master the art of campfire travel? Here are some tips and tricks to get you started.

## Unlock Campfires

The first step to campfire travel is to unlock campfires. You can do this by simply exploring the game world, completing quests, and interacting with NPCs. Whenever you come across a new location, make sure to check if there is a campfire nearby. Once you light a campfire, it becomes a fast travel point that you can access from any other campfire. You can also use crafting materials to upgrade and enhance campfires, making them more powerful and convenient.

## Plan Your Route

Once you have unlocked a few campfires, it's time to plan your route. Horizon Forbidden West's game world is vast and complex, with multiple regions and biomes to navigate. To make the most of campfire travel, you need to plan your route strategically. Identify the key locations you want to visit and plot a course that takes advantage of the campfires. This will save you time and reduce the risk of getting lost or ambushed by enemies.

## Stock Up on Supplies

Before you set out on your campfire travel adventure, make sure you have enough supplies to survive the journey. This includes weapons, ammunition, healing items, and crafting materials. You may encounter all kinds of dangers during your travels, so it's important to be prepared for any situation. You can also use the campfires as a base of operations to restock and resupply, making it easier to sustain your journey.

## Be Mindful of Enemies

Campfire travel is a quick and convenient way to get around, but it's not without risks. Some campfires are located in hostile territory, which means you may encounter enemies when you teleport to them. Be mindful of your surroundings and keep your weapons handy. If you're not prepared for a fight, it's best to avoid those campfires and find alternative routes. You can also use stealth to sneak past enemies or lure them into traps.

## Enjoy the Scenery

Finally, don't forget to enjoy the scenery. Horizon Forbidden West's game world is stunningly beautiful and full of surprises. As you teleport from campfire to campfire, take a moment to appreciate the landscape and the wildlife. You may discover hidden treasures, rare resources, or even new quests that you wouldn't have found otherwise. Campfire travel is not just a means to an end – it's a journey in itself.

In conclusion, mastering the art of campfire travel is an essential skill for any adventurer in Horizon Forbidden West. With careful planning, resource management, and situational awareness, you can unlock faster travels and pack more heat. So light that campfire, plot that course, and embark on a journey of epic proportions. The horizon is waiting for you.

These are all the different ways to fast travel in Horizon Forbidden West. While campfires allow you to travel for free, they can be far sometimes. But if they can be easily reached, make sure to save your Fast Travel Pack and use the free mode of teleportation in the game. Plus, campfires allow you to save manually so there’s an additional benefit for you.
