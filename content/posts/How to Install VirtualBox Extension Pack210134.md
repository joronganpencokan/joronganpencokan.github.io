##   What Is the VirtualBox Extension Pack?   
 

As the name suggests, the Extension Pack an add-on that you install first on your machine's main OS (called the host, where OS you'll be running is the guest ). It includes a number of drivers and other software that help better integrate the two systems, such as: 

 
- If you have USB 2 or 3 devices plugged into the host machine that you want the guest to be able to access, you'll need the Extension Pack.
 - If you're concerned about the security of your guest OS, you can encrypt it if you have the Extension Pack installed.
 - It's common to want to access your guest OS from another machine, for example if you're running it on a network server. The Extension Pack adds the ability to remote into the guest OS via RDP.
 - Suppose you have a webcam that only has drivers available for Windows, but you want to use it with a piece of macOS software. In this case you'll need the Extension Pack to pass the webcam's video through to the guest.

 
The Extension Pack refers to some extra tools installed on the host machine. There are also some similar items to be installed on OS running on VirtualBox, referred to as the Guest Additions. However, that these are two different things, and they're neither required by one another nor mutually exclusive.
