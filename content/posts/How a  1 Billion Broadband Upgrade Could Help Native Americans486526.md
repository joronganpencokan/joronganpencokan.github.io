Title: Breaking News: Revolutionary 1 Billion Broadband Upgrade Set to Revolutionize Native American Communities!

Subheading: In a historic agreement, Native American communities will be receiving a massive broadband upgrade to close the digital divide and enhance access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.

Dateline: [Location] - [Date]

Lead:

In a landmark moment for Native American communities across the United States, a powerful consortium of technology companies has announced a groundbreaking 1 billion broadband upgrade initiative designed to revolutionize tribal lands' digital landscape. The ambitious plan looks set to bridge the digital divide, boost economic growth and create new opportunities for education, healthcare and lifelong learning, thereby helping to transform the lives of indigenous populations across the US.

Body:

Speaking to reporters today, the chief executives of various technology firms, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, outlined the plan, which will see the construction of a cutting-edge broadband network across hundreds of reservations and tribal lands within the next five years.

The move is expected to help connect millions of Native American citizens who are currently living with little or no broadband coverage, improving access to key services, such as telemedicine and remote learning. Furthermore, the new network could create numerous job opportunities, from the infrastructure construction industry to the digital marketplace, boosting the region's overall economic growth.

According to Brad Smith, President of Microsoft, "This is a historic moment for our nation's indigenous people, who have long suffered from a lack of access to reliable and high-speed internet access. With this new network, we hope to create new opportunities for Native Americans to participate in the digital economy and to drive growth and development in their communities."

The new initiative comes at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need for reliable internet access across the country, given that so many people are now working, learning and accessing critical services remotely. However, even before the pandemic, the digital divide was a major issue for many indigenous communities. Now, with the launch of this massive broadband upgrade, Native Americans can look forward to a brighter and more connected future.

Conclusion:

The announcement of the $1 billion broadband upgrade initiative marks a dramatic turning point for the indigenous communities of the US. With more access to broadband, they will be able to participate in today's digital world, opening up opportunities for innovation and growth that were previously unavailable.

As we move forward, it is encouraging to see technology companies coming together to address the digital divide that has held back so many Native Americans for too long. By creating a vibrant and connected digital infrastructure across the country's tribal lands, indigenous communities can finally receive the access they deserve to the same tools and opportunities that many Americans take for granted.

The digital divide wends its way through Native American reservations around the country, but a new federal initiative could help bridge the gap.

 
### 
Key Takeaways
 
- Native American tribal areas are some of the least connected in the country. A $1 billion federal allocation could help build broadband for tribes. Some companies say that 5G technology could be vital to improving internet access on reservations.

 

The Biden administration has allocated $1 billion in funding, which could help rural providers offer fiber broadband. The move could help the large number of Native Americans currently without high-speed internet access.

 

"For generations, a lack of infrastructure investment in Indian Country has left Tribes further behind in the digital divide than most areas of the country," Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary, said at a news conference announcing the funding.

 

"We have a responsibility as a country to build infrastructure that will fuel economic development, keep communities safe, and ensure everyone has opportunities to succeed."

 
##   A Digital Divide  
 

Lack of broadband access is a big issue for tribes. While a little over two-thirds of Native American tribal lands in the continental U.S. have access to broadband internet, according to an American Indian Policy Institute analysis of federal data, this access is the bare minimum by the FCC—25 Mbps download 3 Mbps upload requirements. The same study found fewer than half of all residents had broadband in their own homes. 

 

"Lack of reliable broadband compounds already deep economic disparities among rural and distant communities," Scott Neuman, a vice president at Calix, which provides cloud, software platforms, systems, and services to communications service providers, said in an email interview. "Native American communities remain at a severe disadvantage due to their lack of access." 

 

The coronavirus pandemic showed how important online access is, experts say. 

 
We have a responsibility as a country to build infrastructure that will fuel economic development, keep communities safe, and ensure everyone has opportunities to succeed.
 

"Over the course of the past 16 months, broadband has become as crucial as electricity and water," Neuman said. "People are working, learning, and accessing healthcare online—why shouldn’t everyone have the same quality of access?"

 

Since Native American communities are spread across large geographic areas, increased broadband access could boost health care, education, and commerce, Bart van Aardenne, the CEO of network solutions provider Terranet Communications, said in an email interview. 

 

"As health care moves increasingly online, telemedicine can provide patients access to resources that would otherwise be accessible only through long journeys or not at all," he added. "Modern education is inextricably bound to the internet, now more than ever. Moving forward, the process of delivering learning, doing homework, and communicating with parents and students will forever be tied into an online presence." 

 
##   5G Is Coming  
 

The new funding will be used to build out communications infrastructure in tribal areas, van Aardenne said. The equipment will include the 4G and 5G radio network equipment and the connectivity needed to tie the local radio networks to the internet.

 

The installation of 5G networks is also about preserving the independence of tribes, some observers say. ISP Supplies works with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes to bring broadband to their reservations. 

 

"Our partnership gives the tribes the ability to deploy private LTE/5G, allowing them to maintain their sovereignty while enabling economic opportunities among their members," David Peterson, a senior engineer at ISP Supplies, said in an email interview. 

 

Among the broadband options, 5G coverage is notably lacking on many tribal lands, Stephen Douglas, head of 5G strategy at telecommunications company Spirent, said in an email interview. Many Native Americas live in sparsely populated areas that are often not commercially attractive by commercial ISPs.  

 

"The often-rugged terrain makes the infrastructure complex and costly to build and deploy, making it difficult for poor communities to fund jointly," Douglas said. 

 

The technology behind 5G offers some advantages in rural areas, Douglas said. 

 

"The 5G low band spectrum, such as 2.5 GHz and 600 MHz, can provide long-range coverage lowering the number and cost of cell sites required and offering speeds between 100-300 Mbps which is significantly faster than 4G and comparable to fixed broadband," he added.
