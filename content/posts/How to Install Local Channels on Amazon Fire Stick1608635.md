##   Can I Get Local Channels on Fire Stick?  
 

Anything typically delivered over the air and received by an antenna or a TV provider is considered local programming. This programming typically stems from major networks like ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, and PBS. There may be offshoot broadcasts from local stations too like classic TV programming, and so on.

 

Press up on the remote’s navigation ring until you highlight the Home category.

 

Press right on the remote’s navigation ring to highlight the Apps category.

 

Press the Select button.

Highlight the Get button on the following screen and press the remote's Select button.

 

With the app installed, you can stream a limited library of full episodes, news stories, and other network content.

 
To watch live TV, networks typically require a subscription through cable operators, internet service providers, network-specific subscriptions, or through third-party services.
 

Open NBC’s app and navigate to its Live category listed on the menu. 

 

With the guide open, select any broadcast. Here we chose the local NBC station.

 

The app presents a screen listing several TV providers like Cox, DirecTV, Spectrum, Verizon, and more. Select your TV provider.

 

You may or may not need to log in with credentials before the app links your TV provider.

Fire TV Stick owners basically have four options to access local channels:

 
- Individual networksStandalone streaming services provided by TV providersThird-party servicesOver-the-air hardware

 

The least expensive route is to use apps that access a TV provider’s streaming service, like Charter’s Spectrum TV. With this service, you can stream local channels along with selectable cable-based networks over the internet—no coaxial cabling or set-top-box rentals required. These cost money, but services like Spectrum TV are separate from the traditional cable and satellite TV subscriptions.

 

The next-best method is to use network-specific apps. The drawback here is that to access a network’s full content portfolio, viewers must have a TV subscription either through a provider’s traditional package (basic cable, etc) or its standalone streaming service.

 
##   Limited Streaming Services from TV Providers  
 

Unfortunately, options to watch streaming services from cable TV providers are currently limited. Chater's Spectrum TV app isn't available nor is Comcast's Xfinity service. However, you can install AT&T's WatchTV, TV, and U-verse apps as well as DISH Anywhere.

 
##   Watch Live TV from Third-Party Services  
 

You can subscribe to third-party services that provide local channel access. For instance, Hulu offers the Hulu + Live TV subscription plan, which includes its standard content along with local and cable-based channel access.

 

Sling TV offers local programming too with pricing starting around $15 per month. You can install the Sling TV app on your Fire Stick or Fire TV. Other services supporting live TV include Google's YouTube TV, and Fubo TV.

 
##   Watch Live TV Using an Antenna  
 

One method to grab local programming is to purchase a digital antenna and connect it to a PC. In turn, the PC needs software like Plex Media Server for Windows, macOS, or Linux to deliver those over-the-air broadcasts across your local network. The Plex app for Android serves as a receiver.

 

The drawback, however, is not only the additional hardware cost, but the varying quality of digital over-the-air broadcasts.

 
##   Cable-Based Networks Have Apps Too  
 

Finally, you'll find more than 30 apps provided by cable-based networks. These include A&E, AMC, Cartoon Network, Comedy Central, FreeForm, Lifetime, MTV, SyFy, TBS, TNT, and many more.

 

Typically you can enjoy a limited library of content from each cable network, just like ABC and NBC. To unlock everything, you'll need a subscription with a cable provider. Even more, you may find cable networks offering subscriptions to unlock exclusive content.

 

For instance, AMC Premier removes ads for around $5 per month. The plan also gives viewers access to episodes 48 hours early, exclusives, extended episodes, and curated content from BBC America, IFC, and Sundance. AMC must be a part of your TV subscription package, however.

 
To set up your Fire Stick, plug the included power adapter into a nearby outlet or power strip. Run the included USB cable behind the TV and connect the Fire TV to an available HDMI port. Turn on your TV and use the Source button to locate the Fire TV’s HDMI signal.
