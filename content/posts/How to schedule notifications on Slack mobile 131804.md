Revolutionize Your Slack Game: Learn How To Schedule Notifications On Your Phone Now!

At present, it is impossible to imagine our work without Slack, the communication and collaboration tool that has brought people together even during the pandemic, allowing teams to collaborate, share, and communicate regardless of their location. With the increase in the number of users, Slack has renewed its features to keep up with the demands of its users.

One of the most useful features recently launched in Slack is the ability to schedule notifications on your phone. Do you often miss essential messages and notifications that you receive on your Slack due to your busy schedule or meetings? If yes, then this feature is for you. It will change your Slack game entirely beyond expectations.

Here’s how you can schedule notifications on your Slack mobile app.

Step 1: Open the Slack app on your device.

Step 2: Tap on the three horizontal lines on the top-left corner of the screen.

Step 3: Select the ‘You’ option listed under the profile icon.

Step 4: Tap on Notifications.

Step 5: Click on ‘Scheduled Notifications’ listed at the bottom of the screen.

Step 6: Once you enable the feature, you will have various options to set notification settings according to your preference. You can select the time of your day, the days you want to be notified, and more.

With this feature, you can schedule the Slack notifications in such a way that they will never interrupt you during a meeting or sleep. By scheduling, you can also avoid missing essential updates. This feature is helpful not only in the case of receiving notifications, but it also has a productivity boost that will reflect on your overall work.

In conclusion, Slack's new feature of scheduling notifications on your phone is a lifesaver for busy people. It is an easy-to-use feature that can be personalized according to your needs and will help you better manage notifications. So if you want to revolutionize your Slack game, do not hesitate to enable this feature on your mobile app. You will undoubtedly notice the positive impact it will bring in your work-life balance.

What do you do?
Sometimes you just have to shut off from the business of business. That can simply mean when you're off the clock, you're seriously off the clock.
If your team depends on Slack to keep the lines of communication and collaboration going, you might find many of your fellow teammates work the wildest hours. This can be exacerbated when you have team members who work in other countries. The last thing you need is a Slack notification waking you in the middle of the night.
If that sounds like you, I want to show you how you can schedule notifications in the mobile edition of Slack, so you don't have to worry about having your precious family time (or sleep) interrupted by incessant missives from your teams.
I'll be demonstrating on the Android version of Slack, but this process should be the same on iOS as well.

 
## Scheduling Slack notifications


Let's assume you want to only allow Slack notifications during what is usually considered typical work hours (so, 9-5). I realize the very idea of only working 9-5 these days is almost laughable but play along.
Open Slack on your mobile device and tap the You tab at the bottom of the screen. In the resulting screen (Figure 1), tap Notifications.

In the next screen (Figure 2), tap Notification schedule.

In the resulting screen (Figure 3), tap Start and set a start time for Slack notifications.

Next, tap End and (as you did for the Start time) turn the clock hand to 5 and then select PM (Figure 4).

You can now back out of the Notification schedule screen and be confident your professional life will be less likely to interfere with your home life.

 
## A different approach


I can imagine some of you thinking, "It's not that easy and I have to be more available than that." That is understandable. So, if your job depends on you allowing notifications to come through deeper into the day, you could set the End time to extend later in the day and then manually disable notifications as needed.
Say, for instance, you schedule notifications for 5 AM to 10 PM. That might sound a bit extreme, but for some, it's a necessity. What can you do? Let's say you need the peace that comes with not hearing anything from work for the rest of the day (but you don't want to change your start/end times for notifications. You could certainly put your device on mute, but those notifications could still fill up your screen.
Should that sound like you, you could always manually pause notifications as needed. To do that, Open Slack and go to You and tap Pause notifications. You will then be prompted for a time frame (Figure 5) for those notifications to be paused.

The good thing about pausing notifications this way is that you don't have to worry about manually unpausing them. Say, for instance, you're out to eat with your significant other and you want to pause notifications for an hour. Do so and, once that hour is up, the notifications will resume.
You don't have to be ruled by your job 24/7. Taking time to be away from anything related to work is necessary to recharge and prevent yourself from collapsing under the weight of pressure to be productive.
Schedule and/or pause those Slack notifications and take care of yourself.
