Unleash The Ultimate Power! Your Step-by-Step Guide to Making the Best Decisions in Guardians of the Galaxy

The Marvel cinematic universe is a vast and exciting place filled with superheroes, villains, and everything in between. One of the most beloved and unconventional groups of heroes in this universe is the Guardians of the Galaxy. Made up of a motley crew of characters from different worlds and walks of life, the Guardians embark on thrilling adventures across the cosmos.

As a player of the Guardians of the Galaxy video game, you take on the role of Peter Quill, also known as Star-Lord, as he leads the team on their latest mission. One of the key elements of the game is decision-making, as the choices you make will determine the outcome of the story. In this guide, we'll show you how to make the best decisions in the game and unleash the ultimate power of the Guardians. 

Step 1: Understand Your Characters

Before making any decisions in the game, it's crucial to understand your characters and their motivations. Each member of the Guardians has their own unique personality and backstory, and this will influence the choices they make. It's important to pay attention to how they respond to different situations and the consequences of those actions. Understanding your characters will help you make decisions that are in line with their personalities and goals.

Step 2: Consider the Consequences

Every decision you make in the game will have consequences, some more significant than others. When faced with a choice, take the time to consider what the outcome might be. Will your decision lead to a positive outcome for your team, or will it create more problems? Will it affect your relationships with other characters? Will it impact the overall story and ending of the game? By considering the consequences of your decisions, you can make choices that will benefit your team and help you achieve your goals.

Step 3: Communicate With Your Team

The Guardians of the Galaxy are a team, and communication is key to their success. When making decisions, it's important to consider the opinions and input of your team members. Talking to them and understanding their perspectives can help you make the best decisions for the group. Additionally, building strong relationships with your team members can unlock special abilities and dialogue options that can aid you in your mission.

Step 4: Trust Your Gut

Sometimes, the best decisions are the ones that come from the heart. In the game, you'll be faced with tough choices that don't always have a clear right or wrong answer. When this happens, trust your instincts and make the decision that feels right to you. Don't be afraid to take risks or go against the norm if it means protecting your team and achieving your goals.

Step 5: Own Your Choices

Once you've made a decision, own it. Accept the consequences of your actions and move forward with confidence. Don't second-guess yourself or dwell on what could have been. Remember that every decision you make is an opportunity for growth and learning, and it will ultimately shape the outcome of the game.

In conclusion, making the best decisions in Guardians of the Galaxy requires understanding your characters, considering the consequences, communicating with your team, trusting your gut, and owning your choices. By following these steps, you'll be able to unleash the ultimate power of the Guardians and lead your team to victory. Happy gaming!

Table of Contents
 
### Chapter One Choices & Consequences in Guardians of the Galaxy
 
There are no important choices and consequences in this chapter of Guardians of the Galaxy. You will only find a few dialogue choices that do not have a lot of consequences.
 
### Chapter Two Choices & Consequences in Guardians of the Galaxy
 
#### Double Down or Lie
 
When you face this particular choice in Guardians of the Galaxy, you can choose between either Double Down or Lie.
 
If you choose Double Down, you will see Star Lord discussing his past with the captain of the other ship. During this conversation, he will promise that he does not intend on smuggling anything. Drax will enter the cockpit with a box of illegal tech items. This will result in the captain not paying heed to any of your pleas.
 
If you choose Lie, you will simply lie and tell the captain that your navigation malfunctioned. Drax will now arrive with a box of illegal goods. Following this, you will be threatened with arrest.
 
#### Hide the Creature or Hide the Tech
 
If you pick Hide the Creature, Star Lord will ask Drax to hide the Llama. This will disappoint Rocket, as he wants the technology. To justify his actions, Star Lord will explain that he has had relations in the past with the captain of the other ship. Because of this, he believes that he can convince the captain to allow them to keep the tech. The Star Lord, however, does not feel like the captain will avoid the potential of a biohazard. This means that if you go ahead with this decision, you will receive a fine of 7000 units for smuggling tech that is illegal. The Llama, however, will be with you throughout the entirety of the journey. You will also be able to pet it during certain points of the storyline.
 
If you choose to Hide the Tech, you will displease Gomora. Despite this, she will trust you when you tell her that you will be able to talk your way out of the mess. A little while later, you will see a boarding party arriving. You will receive a fine of 8000 units. Further in the game, you will receive lock-on rockets for your ship whenever you battle in space.
 
#### Back Pedal or Stick Up For Nikki
 
If you choose the Back Pedal option, you will quite literally backpedal and then say that Nikki has a conviction. She will not be happy with this action. However, regardless of whatever happens, both of you will be going up in the elevator.
 
If you choose Stick Up For Nikki, Star Lord will tell her mother that she took care of herself quite well and that her mother should be proud. However, Nikki’s mother will continue to remain upset at her daughter. She will then proceed to lock down the elevator.
 
#### Make A Joke, Back-Up Ko-Rel, Reaactivate Elevator
 
Of these different choices in Guardians of the Galaxy, if you choose to Make a Joke, Star Lord will make a joke about getting stuck inside an elevator. However, Nikki and her mother will not be very appreciative of the joke and will make their displeasure known. They will then continue to argue among themselves. This choice will gradually result in Nikki giving you her passkey as she now trusts you. Because of this, you will be able to enter her room as the story progresses.
 
If you decide to Back Up Ko-Rel, you will tell Nikki how you feel her mother is on to her. Ko-Rel will not allow anybody to leave the elevator until somebody gives her answers. Nikki, however, will end up losing her key because of her vague attempts to lie and say she can fit through things easier because of her small size.
 
If you pick Reactivate Elevator, you will fail in trying to stop the lockdown. Both Nikki, as well as her mother, will be express their frustration with you. Nikki will also express hesitation at trusting you.
 
#### Side with Ko-Rel or Try to Help Nikki

If you decide to try to help Nikki, you will tell Nikki about the glitch which is present across all the systems. Nikki will mention the security being down, after which you will agree with her. After this, Ko-Rel will order Nikki to clear her pockets. However, Ko-Rel will be met with a stern no from Nikki.
 
#### Tell Ko-Rel the Truth, Divert Attention, Take The Blame
 
Choosing to tell Ko-Rel the truth about Nikki having a passkey will result in Nikki getting upset with you and giving up her passkey.
 
Picking the option to Divert Attention will result in you telling Ko-Rel that you still harbor feelings for her. This will result in both, Nikki as well as Ko-Rel getting surprised. Nikki will also begin to doubt her ability to trust you, and you will find out that Nikki created the key herself. Despite this, she will still lose the key.
 
#### Do The Math or Ignore The Math
 
If you choose to do the math, you will come to the realization that Nikki is quite likely your daughter. Ko-Rel will offer to pay off your fine over a period of three cycles. You will have to pay an amount of either 7 or 8000 units for smuggling, and this depends on your earlier choices.
 
However, if you decide to ignore the math, Star Lord will offer his toy chewie the choice to either stay or come back to him. Star Lord will play with the Wookie, even mimicking the voice of a Wookie when doing so. The chewie will then realize that he is alright and choose to stay back with Ko-Rel.

He will also explain that such a death would be a glorious one, however, the team will counter this statement, claiming that death is not the objective. Rocket will then claim that the best choice is to sell Gamura’s figures. Groot will gather the team together and suggest that everybody needs to combine each other’s ideas.

#### Vote to Sell Groot or Rocket
 
If you decide to sell Groot, Star Lord will thank him for volunteering to be sold. He will explain how Groot is a more convincing choice. Along with this, he also promises to help rescue Groot as soon as the transaction has been completed. You will be offered the opportunity to change your mind later, however, this will not make that big of a difference. All it will do is change a few cutscenes and the mission with Lady Hellbender.
 
Now, if you decide to Vote to Sell Rocket, you will tell him that he is fearsome on the inside.
 
#### Encourage Drax or Stop Drax
 
Choosing to encourage Drax will quite literally result in you encouraging him, infuriating Rocket in the process. To pacify him, you will then tell him that you will offer him a rise of 10% to his cut. The next time you make the suggestion to toss Rocket, he will get angry again.
 
If you decide to stop Drax, Star Lord will end up informing Drax about his intentions to not throw Rocket. Instead, he will decide to find another way.
 
#### Stand your Ground or Change your Mind
 
If you choose the former, Star Lord will inform Drax of his plans to get Groot into the cage. The only major differences here will be in the form of cutscenes, so there’s not much to worry about.

Choosing to go with Qualify will result in you having to find another way to convince your mother, as she will not budge.
 
#### Rationalize
 
As the name suggests, you will try to appeal to your mother through rational means. However, despite this, she will need a little more convincing.
 
#### Compromise

#### Take The Lead Or Encourage Drax

He will then proceed to speak with the woman and tell her that she needs to be well-versed with the specific weapon. The queen will also offer to give Drax a demonstration. Depending on your earlier choice, you will either show the queen Rocket or Groot.
 
#### Encourage Cuteness or Push Rocket
 
If you choose to encourage cuteness, you will convince the queen about Rocket’s cuteness when he drinks from a saucer. The queen will enjoy this, and even express her appreciation at his attitude. Quite weirdly, though, this appreciation will trigger Rocket into shooting at everyone.
 
If you choose to push ferociousness, you will need to convince the queen that Rocket is genuinely strong. You will have to convince her that Rocket can actually be a potent killing machine.
 
#### Groot Price Negotiation (Offer Less/Support Drax)
 
If you offer less, Star Lord will counter you with an offer for 10,000 units. While Gamora and Star Lord will agree about 10,000 units being perfect, Drax will still stand by his request of 20,000 units. Eventually, he will settle for an amount of 9,537 units, and Groot will be taken away.
 
If you choose to support Drax’s request for 20,000 units, Lady Hellbender will offer 15,000 units, with the condition that Drax needs to stay. Countering this, Drax will explain his other commitments, and Hellbender will finally agree on a price of 12,000 units.
 
#### Price Negotiation for Rocket (Stick with Offer/Offer Less)
 
If you choose to stick with the original offer, you will have the opportunity to agree to Rocket’s suggestion of 20,000 units.

#### Put It Down Or Speak Into Helmet

You will be witness to the executions of Nova Corps members as you leave.
 
If you decide to speak into the helmet, you will hear voices through the helmet. However, these voices will not sound like those of Nova Corps. The voices will offer help when you tell them you are in search of the centurion. The voices say they will come to you when you tell them where you are.
