Revolutionary Hack: Boost Your Youtube Speed in Microsoft Edge Instantly!

For all the Youtube addicts out there who can't get enough of their favorite content, slow internet speed can be a major buzzkill. Long buffering times, pixelated videos, and stuttering audio can ruin the viewing experience and suck the fun out of even the best content. But what if we told you there's a simple yet revolutionary hack that can boost your Youtube speed in Microsoft Edge instantly? Yes, you heard it right! With just a few clicks, you can enjoy smoother, faster, and higher quality Youtube videos, like never before.

Before we dive into the hack, it's important to understand the context. Microsoft Edge is a web browser developed by Microsoft as a successor to Internet Explorer. It has been gaining popularity among users due to its faster browsing speed, built-in security, and smooth interface. But even with all its features, Edge can sometimes lag behind when it comes to streaming videos, especially on Youtube.

The reason behind this is that Microsoft Edge uses HTML5 as the default video playback mode for streaming videos like Youtube. While HTML5 is an efficient and versatile playback mode, it can become a bottleneck for video rendering if the computer's hardware or software is not optimized for it. Moreover, Youtube uses different video codecs and formats that may not be fully compatible with Edge's default settings, leading to buffering issues and slow loading times.

To circumvent these problems, we recommend switching to a different video playback mode for streaming Youtube videos in Microsoft Edge. Specifically, we suggest using the Media Source Extensions (MSE) playback mode, which provides faster and more reliable video playback by enabling the web browser to dynamically adapt to the video stream's bandwidth and resolution.

So, how do you switch to MSE playback mode in Microsoft Edge? It's pretty simple, just follow these steps:

1. Open Microsoft Edge and go to Youtube.com
2. Click on the three horizontal dots in the upper right corner of the browser window, and then click "Settings."
3. Scroll down and click on "Advanced Settings."
4. Under "System," click on "Use hardware acceleration when available" to turn it on.
5. Close the settings tab and refresh the Youtube video you want to watch.

And voila, you're done! By enabling hardware acceleration, you're allowing Microsoft Edge to use your computer's graphics processor to process video content more efficiently. This, in turn, improves the overall video playback performance and reduces buffering times, leading to a smoother and faster Youtube experience.

In addition to switching to the MSE playback mode, there are a few more things you can do to optimize your Youtube speed in Microsoft Edge:

- Clear your browser cache and cookies regularly to free up storage space and improve browsing speed.
- Disable browser extensions that may interfere with video streaming, such as ad blockers or pop-up blockers.
- Use an up-to-date version of Microsoft Edge and ensure that your computer's hardware and software requirements are met.

All in all, the revolutionary hack of switching to the Media Source Extensions (MSE) playback mode in Microsoft Edge can make a huge difference in your Youtube streaming experience. It's a simple yet powerful solution that can help you overcome slow loading times, buffering issues, and endless waiting. Give it a try and see for yourself how much improvement you can achieve in just a few clicks. Happy streaming!

YouTube introduced its new design almost a year ago, but ever since, if you’ve been using another browser other than Chrome, such as Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, or Apple’s Safari, you probably have noticed that YouTube loads really slow.
 
According to Chris Paterson, a program manager at Mozilla, explains that the problem isn’t the browser. It’s the sneaky decision of Google to use a deprecated shadow DOM API that you can now only find it in Chrome, and as a result YouTube can load up to five time slower in other browsers.
 
If you’re a Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, or even a Safari user, it’s possible to force the old design to load YouTube as fast as when using Chrome.
 
In this guide, you’ll learn the steps to make YouTube load faster in Microsoft Edge.
 
## How to make YouTube load faster in Microsoft Edge
 
In order to make YouTube five times faster in Microsoft Edge, follow these steps:
 
- Open the Microsoft Store.
 - Search for Tampermonkey, and click the top result.
 - Click the Install button.
 - Installing Tampermonkey for Microsoft Edge
 - Click the Launch button.
 - Turn on the extension. (If you don’t see a popup to turn on the extension, open Settings, click on Extensions, and enable Tampermonkey.)
