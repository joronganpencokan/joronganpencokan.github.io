# Unlock the Ultimate Rust Survival Strategy: Learn How to Invite and Add Friends to Your Squad with this Complete Guide!

Rust is a popular multiplayer survival game that requires you to work with others to survive in a harsh, unforgiving environment. Building alliances can mean the difference between life and death in a game where danger lurks around every corner. If you're playing Rust, you may have realized that adding friends to your squad can help improve your chances of surviving. This guide will show you how to invite and add friends to your squad in Rust so that you can work together and increase your chances of survival.

## Step 1: Create a Clan

To invite and add friends to your squad in Rust, you must create a clan. A clan is similar to a group or guild in other games. It allows you to invite others to join your squad and work together to achieve common goals. Follow these steps to create a clan in Rust:

1. Press F1 to open the console and type in "clan add [name]" where [name] is the name of your clan. 

2. Press enter to create the clan.

3. Once the clan is created, you can invite other players to join your squad.

## Step 2: Invite Players to Join Your Clan

Now that you have created a clan, you can invite other players to join your squad. Follow these steps to invite players to join your clan:

1. Press F1 to open the console and type in "clan invite [player name]" where [player name] is the name of the player you want to invite. 

2. Once you have invited a player to join your clan, they will receive a notification in their game. 

3. The player can then choose to accept or decline your invitation. If they accept, they will become a member of your squad.

## Step 3: Promote Members of Your Clan

Once you have members in your squad, you can promote them to different ranks. This allows you to give them more authority and responsibilities within the clan. Follow these steps to promote members in your clan:

1. Press F1 to open the console and type in "clan promote [player name]" where [player name] is the name of the player you want to promote. 

2. You can promote players to different ranks, such as officer, moderator, or leader. 

3. Each rank has different permissions and responsibilities within the clan. For example, a leader can change the clan name and kick members out of the clan, while an officer can invite and promote members.

## Step 4: Work Together to Survive

Now that you have created a clan, invited players to join your squad, and promoted members in your clan, it's time to work together to survive. Rust is a game where teamwork is essential to survival. Here are some tips for working together in Rust:

1. Communicate with your squad. Use voice chat or text chat to communicate with your teammates. Let them know where you are and what you're doing.

2. Share resources. In Rust, resources are scarce, so it's essential to share resources with your squad. Share food, water, and weapons to increase your chances of survival.

3. Build together. Work together to build a base or a shelter. This provides a safe place to store your resources and protects you from enemies.

4. Protect each other. When one member is being attacked, help them out. Work as a team to defend your squad from enemies.

## Conclusion

Adding friends to your squad in Rust can help improve your chances of survival. By following these steps to create a clan, invite players to join your squad, and promote members in your clan, you can work together to survive in a harsh, unforgiving environment. Remember to communicate, share resources, build together, and protect each other to increase your chances of survival. Good luck and have fun!
