Unlocking Secrets: How To Get Amazon Prime Perks For Pennies with Komando Com's Expert Tips!

Amazon Prime has changed the way we shop online. From free two-day shipping to access to Prime Video and Prime Music, it offers a variety of exclusive perks that make it one of the most popular membership programs in the world. But did you know you can get all of these perks and more for pennies with Komando Com's expert tips?

Komando Com is a website that offers expert advice and resources on technology, digital life, and online security. They also have a team of experts who have found ways to unlock Amazon Prime perks for a fraction of the cost. Here are some of the tips they've shared:

1. Share your Prime account

If you don't use your Amazon Prime account very often, you can share it with family or friends. Amazon allows you to share your account with up to four people, and they'll get access to all the same perks as you. This means you can split the cost of the membership and pay as little as $2.50 a month per person.

2. Get a student discount

Amazon offers a discount on Prime memberships for college students. You can sign up for a six-month trial for free, and then pay half the regular price of Prime for as long as you're in school. This means you can get all the same perks as a regular Prime member for just $6.49 a month.

3. Take advantage of free trials

Amazon frequently offers free trials of their Prime membership. You can sign up for a trial, enjoy all the perks for a month, and then cancel before the trial period ends. Just make sure you set a reminder to cancel, so you don't get charged for the membership.

4. Shop on Amazon Smile

Amazon Smile is a program that donates 0.5% of your eligible purchases to the charity of your choice. When you shop on Amazon Smile, you'll get all the same perks as a regular Prime member, but you'll also be supporting a good cause. Just make sure you're on the Amazon Smile website (smile.amazon.com) instead of the regular Amazon site.

5. Use Amazon Family

Amazon Family is a program that offers exclusive discounts, coupons, and recommendations to parents and caregivers. You'll get all the same Prime perks, plus discounts on baby gear, diaper subscriptions, and more. If you're a parent, this program is a no-brainer.

Amazon Prime is a fantastic membership program that offers a variety of exclusive perks. But if you're looking to save some money, Komando Com's expert tips can help you get all those perks for pennies. Whether you share your account, sign up for a student discount, or shop on Amazon Smile, there's a way to get Prime for less. So why not unlock those secrets today?


Here’s how it works:

 
### Try the free trial:


New Prime subscribers can sign up for a free 30-day trial. You will need to provide your payment details and you will have to cancel if you choose not to continue, but that’s plenty of time to take the service for a test drive to see if an ongoing membership is worth it.

 
### Go monthly:
 
### Discount for people on government assistance:
 
### Talk to customer service about late shipments:
 
### Wait for a sale:
 
### Use Subscribe & Save
 
### Settle for the $25 free shipping:


If you don’t care about the bonus Prime perks like streaming video, two-day shipping, photo storage, and streaming music, then you can skip the whole membership deal and just settle for free shipping. The only catch here is that you need to have at least $25 worth of eligible items in your cart to qualify. This is an easy option for patient and frugal shoppers.
