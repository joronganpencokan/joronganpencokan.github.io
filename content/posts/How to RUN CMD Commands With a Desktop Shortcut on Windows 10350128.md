Cmd commands are an essential part of Windows 10 and are often used by power users and IT professionals. While they offer a range of functionalities, executing them can be a bit tricky.

However, Microsoft has introduced a new feature in Windows 10 that allows you to run cmd commands faster and easier than ever before. Keep reading to know how.

## The Windows Terminal

The Windows Terminal is a new command-line interface for Windows 10 that offers a streamlined experience for running any command-line application, including PowerShell, Cmd, and Linux. It's a single app for all your command-line needs, and you can customize it to suit your preferences.

You can download the Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store or GitHub. Once installed, you can open it by typing "Windows Terminal" in the Start menu.

## Using Keyboard Shortcuts

One of the primary advantages of the Windows Terminal is that it allows you to use keyboard shortcuts to execute commands instead of typing them out.

For example, instead of typing out "cd C:\foldername\subfoldername," you can use the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + Shift + T" to open a new tab and "Alt + D" to focus on the command line. Then, you can type "cd C:\foldername\subfoldername" and press "Enter" to execute the command.

In the same way, you can use keyboard shortcuts for common commands like "dir," "mkdir," "rmdir," "cls," and more.

## Using Command-line Tools

If you're a power user or IT professional, you're probably familiar with some of the popular command-line tools, such as PowerShell, Git, and Python. The Windows Terminal allows you to integrate these tools into a single app, making it easy to switch between them.

To use a command-line tool, you need to add it as a profile in the Windows Terminal. You can do this by opening the "Settings" menu in the Terminal and navigating to the "Profiles" section. Click on "Add a profile" and select the tool you want to use.

Once added, you can use the keyboard shortcuts to switch to a different profile and execute commands in that tool.

## Conclusion

The Windows Terminal is a game-changer for power users and IT professionals, as it allows them to run cmd commands faster and easier than ever before. With keyboard shortcuts, command-line tools, and a streamlined interface, the Terminal offers a range of functionalities that are sure to boost your productivity.

So, why not give it a try and revolutionize your Windows 10 experience today!
