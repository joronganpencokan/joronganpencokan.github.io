Are you tired of the same old survival and adventure games? Are you looking for something new and exciting? Look no further! Grounded, developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Xbox Game Studios, may just be the game for you.

Grounded allows you to explore an entirely new world, but with a twist. You must navigate through a backyard as a tiny human, not much bigger than an ant. You are surrounded by towering blades of grass, massive flowers, and enormous insects that are both friend and foe.

But, how do you know if Grounded is the game for you? Luckily, you won't have to wait long to find out. Xbox Game Studios has announced that the Grounded demo will be available through the Xbox Insider Program and Steam!

The demo will allow you to explore and survive in this unique and exciting world. Not only that, but the demo will also allow players to provide feedback to the developers. You could play a vital role in shaping the final product.

While the demo may not be the full game, it will give players an exclusive sneak peek into the game mechanics, visuals, and general gameplay. From chopping down blades of grass to scrounging for resources, explore this alien environment in ways you never thought possible.

But what else can you expect from Grounded? The game features multiplayer, so you don't have to explore the vast back yard alone. Survive alongside friends, battle giant spiders together, and build bases to protect yourselves from the elements and insects.

As you progress, you'll be able to upgrade your character to better survive this world. Are you a crafting fanatic? Then you'll love Grounded's crafting system, which allows you to create weapons, tools, and even homes made out of found objects.

So, what are you waiting for? If you're interested in exploring a new world and unleashing your inner child, then start downloading the Grounded demo. You never know - this could be the game you've been waiting for.
