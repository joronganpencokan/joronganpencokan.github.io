If you're like most people, you probably use your laptop every day for work, school, or other activities. And, if you're like most people, you've probably experienced the frustrating problem of your laptop's battery constantly dying. However, there's good news for those who use Google Chrome as their preferred web browser: Google has just released a new fix that will help save your laptop's battery life.

Chrome is one of the most widely-used web browsers in the world, but it's also known for being a bit of a battery hog. This is because Chrome uses a lot of memory and processing power, which can cause your laptop's battery to drain quickly. However, with the new fix, Google has made some significant changes to the way that Chrome works, which should help to improve battery life.

So, what exactly has Google done to help save your laptop's battery life? Firstly, they have optimized the way that Chrome handles tabs. Previously, each tab in Chrome would run as a separate process, which would use a lot of memory and processing power. With the new fix, Chrome will now group tabs together into a single process, which should help to reduce the amount of memory and processing power that Chrome uses.

Secondly, Google has improved the way that Chrome handles background processes. Previously, Chrome would continue to run processes in the background even when the browser window was closed. This would also use a lot of memory and processing power, which would cause your laptop's battery to drain quickly. With the new fix, Chrome will now stop all background processes as soon as the browser window is closed, which should help to reduce battery drain.

Finally, Google has made some improvements to the way that Chrome handles video playback. Previously, Chrome would use hardware acceleration to play videos, which would also use a lot of memory and processing power. With the new fix, Chrome will now use software-based video decoding, which should help to reduce battery drain.

Overall, these changes should help to significantly improve the battery life of laptops that use Google Chrome as their preferred web browser. However, it's worth noting that there are still some other factors that can affect battery life, such as the age and condition of your laptop's battery, as well as the number of applications that you have running at the same time. Nevertheless, with this new fix from Google, you can at least be assured that Chrome won't be the cause of your laptop's battery problems.

Recently a report by a Forbes contributor surfaced a Chrome issue that is causing huge battery drain on Windows PCs.
 
The issue seems to be that Google’s web browser, Chrome, doesn’t release system resources when not doing anything. It does this by setting a high “system clock tick rate” of 1 millisecond and the setting keeps this value all the time.
 
Internet Explorer also sets a high clock tick rate when needs to perform heavy tasks, but unlike Chrome, IE returns the default value of 15.625 milliseconds.
 
Now based on Microsoft documentation, having a tick rate of 1 millisecond causes higher power consumption by up to 25% depending on the scenario.
 
The bigger problem is that according to Forbes contributor, Ian Morris, this clear bug in Chrome isn’t recent, as there are bug reports that go back to 2010. Thanks to the newly published report, Google has finally released an official comment saying that the company is working to fix the bug, and because of the attention it is getting, the Chrome team has escalated the priority; as such we could be seeing a fix very soon.
