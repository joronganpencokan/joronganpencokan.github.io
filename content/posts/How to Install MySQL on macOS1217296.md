brew update
```

Then, run the following command to install MySQL: 

```
brew install mysql
```

Homebrew will download and install MySQL and its dependencies automatically. Once the installation is complete, you can start the MySQL server by entering the following command: 

```
mysql.server start
```

You can then access the MySQL shell by typing: 

```
mysql -u root
```

You will be prompted to enter a password, which you can leave blank for now by pressing Enter.
