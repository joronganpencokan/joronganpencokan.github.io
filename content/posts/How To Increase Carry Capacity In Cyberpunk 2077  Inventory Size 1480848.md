Introduction 

Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that is all about exploration, cyber-enhancements, and finding loot. The game offers a character inventory system that allows players to stock up on weapons, armor, and other valuable items. In this guide, we will discuss different ways to boost your inventory size in Cyberpunk 2077.

Step One - Upgrade Attributes 

One of the easiest ways to increase your inventory size is to upgrade your attributes. Players can upgrade the Body attribute to increase the carrying capacity. Additionally, players can upgrade the Technical Ability attribute and invest points in the “Pack Mule” perk. This perk increases your carrying capacity by 60%.

Step Two - Use Backpacks 

Another way to boost your inventory size is to use backpacks. These items can be found throughout the game world and offer varying levels of carrying capacity. Backpacks come in various shapes and sizes, so make sure to look out for different designs.

Step Three - Craft a Storage Device 

Players can craft a storage device in the crafting menu. This item will increase your inventory size by a significant amount. Crafting a storage device requires some technical ability and resources.

Step Four - Purchase Perks 

Players can purchase inventory and carrying capacity perks from the perk tree. The “Stronger Together” perk increases your carrying capacity when you have a companion in your party. The “Pack Mule” perk increases your carrying capacity further, while “Efficient Upgrades” increases the number of items you can craft.

Step Five - Sell and Dismantle Unwanted Items 

Selling and dismantling unwanted items is another quick way to boost your inventory size. Players can sell items to vendors or dismantle items for crafting materials. Make sure to sell any items that you no longer need, as this will free up valuable space in your inventory.

Conclusion 

By following these steps, players can significantly boost their inventory size in Cyberpunk 2077. Remember to invest in attribute points, use backpacks, craft a storage device, purchase carrying capacity perks, and sell or dismantle unwanted items. With these methods, players can unlock unlimited loot possibilities and explore the game world to its fullest.

Cyberpunk 2077 lets you collect and carry a plethora of items. While alternative storage options where you can stash items such as your apartment in Watson and a car trunk are good options, you cannot carry the items within them along. Hence, it is essential to increase your carrying capacity and inventory size in Cyberpunk 2077. This will let you seamlessly roam on the streets of Night City and collect as much loot as you want.
 
## CP2077 How to Increase Carry Capacity and Inventory Size

Now, since we know the options to increase your carry capacity and inventory size in CP2077, let’s have a look at all the options briefly.
 

 
- Clothing Mods

 
Some of the clothing mods such as Backpacker can help increase carry capacity depending on the rarity of the mod. The higher the rarity, the greater is the amount of inventory size increased. You can see the amount of capacity increased under the clothing’s armor score.
 
### Clothing Mods
 
There are numerous clothing vendors available in CP2077 where you can easily get clothing sets and mods. If you don’t have any rare clothing sets yet, you can easily increase Street Cred to unlock new items and sets that you can purchase from vendors.
 
- Pack Mule Perk

 
Every attribute in CP2077 has some perks that you can get. Increasing one of the best starting attributes: the Body attribute can get you the Pack Mule perk. It is under the Athletics tree, which we will be talking about in a bit.
 
### Pack Mule Perk
 
Getting this Pack Mule perk will increase carry capacity and inventory size in Cyberpunk 2077 by 60. If you have spent your perk points in some other tree, don’t worry as you can easily respec perk points in CP2077.
 
- Increase Athletics Skill

 
As mentioned in the previous section, the Athletics skill is a skills tree in the Body attribute that is very useful for increasing your inventory size. Increasing the Athletics skill to some certain levels will increase carrying capacity by a specific amount. Here’s a list of the levels that can help you increase inventory size.
 
### Increase Athletics Skill
 
- Level 2 – +20 Carry Capacity
 - Level 6 – +40 Carry Capacity
 - Level 13 – +100 Carry Capacity

 
You can refer to our how to increase the Athletics guide for help. But to put it in brief, all you need to do is keep sliding, jumping, climbing, punching, dashing, and descending to increase Athletics.
 
- Titanium Bones Cyberware

 
Cyberpunk 2077 has a cybernetics feature that allows you to implant numerous cyberware implants in V’s body. One of the several best cyberware in CP2077 is the Titanium Bones Cyberware. Purchasing and implanting this cyberware will significantly increase carry capacity and inventory size in Cyberpunk 2077.
 
### Titanium Bones Cyberware
 
All you need to do is find a ripperdoc and purchase the Titanium Bones at 1,000 Eurodollars. Another thing to note is that you need to have an empty skeleton slot so that you can implant this cyberware. It will increase your overall weight capacity by 20%, meaning that you can carry extra weight. Hence, we cannot say that this is a direct method to increase your carry capacity, but it can come in handy when combined with any of the above direct methods.
