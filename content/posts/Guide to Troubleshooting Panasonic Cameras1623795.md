Problems are somewhat rare with Panasonic Lumix digital cameras, but on those occasions where you have an issue, you may receive an error message or the camera may stop working for no apparent reason. The seven tips listed here should help you troubleshoot your Panasonic camera error messages.

 
##   Built-In Memory Error  
 

If you see this error message with your Panasonic camera, the internal memory area of the camera is either full or corrupted. Try downloading photos from the internal memory. If the error message continues to appear, you may need to format the internal memory area.

 
##   Memory Card Locked and Memory Card  
 

Both of these error messages are related to the memory card, rather than the Panasonic camera. If you have an SD memory card, check the write-protect switch on the side of the card. Slide the switch up to unlock the card. If the error message persists, the memory card may be corrupted and needs to be formatted.

 

It's also possible the memory card was formatted using another device that is not compatible with Panasonic's file structure system. Format the card with your Panasonic camera to fix the problem. But be aware: Formatting the card erases any data stored on it.

 
##   No Additional Selections Can Be Made  
 

If your Panasonic camera allows you to save photos as your favorites, you may find this error message because the camera has a limited number of photos that can be labeled as favorites, usually 999 photos. You cannot mark another photo as a favorite until you remove the favorite label from one or more photos. This error message also may occur if you're trying to delete more than 999 photos at one time.

 
##   No Valid Picture  
 

This error message typically refers to a problem with the memory card. Most of the time, you'll find this error message when you play back images from the memory card, and the memory card is corrupted, empty, broken, or has been formatted by a different camera.

 

To fix the memory card, you must format it, but formatting a memory card causes all photos stored on it to be lost. Insert the memory card in another device or in your computer and download any photos stored on it before formatting it with your Panasonic camera.

 
##   Please Turn Camera Off and Then On Again  
 

This error message most likely occurs when a part of the camera's hardware malfunctions, usually a jammed lens housing. To fix this problem, start by turning the camera off for a few seconds before turning it back on.

 

If this technique doesn't work, reset the camera by removing the battery and memory card from the camera for at least 10 minutes. Replace both items and then turn the camera on again. If the lens housing jams as the lens moves through its zoom range, gently clean the housing, removing any debris or grime. If these steps don't fix the problem, take the camera to a repair center or technician.

 
##   This Battery Cannot Be Used  
 

With this error message, you've either inserted a battery that's incompatible with your Panasonic camera or you've inserted a battery that has dirty contacts. Gently clean the metal contacts with a dry cloth. In addition, make sure the battery housing is free of debris. You may see this error message if you use a battery that's not manufactured by Panasonic. If the non-Panasonic battery is working okay to power the camera, you can ignore this error message.

 
##   This Picture Is Protected  
 

You'll see this Panasonic camera error message when the photo you selected is protected from deletion. Work through the camera's menus to figure out how to remove any protection labels for the photo files.

 
Different models of Lumix cameras may provide a different set of error messages. If you encounter Panasonic camera error messages that aren't listed here, check the user guide for your model of Panasonic Lumix camera for a list of other error messages, or visit the support area of the Panasonic website.
