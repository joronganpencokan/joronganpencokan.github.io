- Google to release new features to integrate Android into Windows 11.
 - Some of the features include Fast Pair, Nearby Share, Google Messages, and gaming.
 - The features are expected to arrive in 2022.

 
Alongside a slew of software announcements planned for 2022, Google has revealed that it will invest resources to improve Android integration to Windows 11 (and Windows 10).
 
According to the announcement, Google is partnering with Intel, Acer, and HP to focus on bringing Android features to better connect with Windows computers as part of the company’s “better together” project.
 
For instance, as part of the features, the company is working to make it easy to connect Android phones to Windows 11 with Fast Pair. In addition, you will be able to configure Bluetooth accessories, sync your text messages, and share files with a Windows laptop or desktop using Android’s Nearby Share.
 
Android’s Nearby Share is a feature that lets you share data between two devices using the same feature, similar to AirDrop from Apple and Nearby Sharing on Windows 11. However, the new update will allow the Nearby Share to work between Android and Windows devices.
 
Although you can already access your Google Messages on your computer through the web, it appears that Google may be planning to bring an app of some sort that will let you interact with your messages within Windows. However, it’s unclear if this will include phone calls.
 
Finally, Google will also update its Fast Pair Bluetooth feature on Android to effortlessly connect your phone to your computer. In addition, the feature update may also be used to connect other phone accessories to your device.
 
Furthermore, while Google won’t be bringing its Play Store with all the apps to Windows 11, the company plans to bring the gaming part of the store.
 
After seeing the renewed investment in the phone market with the launch of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro phones and now announcing the many new features coming in 2022, it’s clear that Google is planning to try and catch up with the Apple ecosystem. However, only time will tell if the efforts will pay off.
 
In addition to the new features specific to the Windows platform, Google is also planning to bring the same and even more features to Android to integrate the platform with Chromebooks better. Some of these include improvements for Fast Pair to make it easier to pair Bluetooth headphones. The company will extend auto-switching between devices, faster pairing to Android TV and Google TV. You will be able to unlock your phone or Chromebooks with smartwatches using Wear OS 3 and more.
