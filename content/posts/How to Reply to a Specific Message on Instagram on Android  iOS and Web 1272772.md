Title: You've Been Doing It Wrong! The Secret to Replying to Specific Instagram Messages Revealed!

As Instagram's messaging feature has gradually evolved, the platform has become a popular hub for connecting with friends, family, and business associates. Instagram Direct, the platform's built-in messaging system, allows users to have private conversations with other users on the platform. Whether you're using Instagram Direct to chat with friends or to network with potential customers or clients, you might be struggling to keep track of individual conversations. There's nothing worse than accidentally sending a message to the wrong person, or not responding to a crucial message from a client or customer.

Thankfully, Instagram Direct includes a handy feature that allows you to reply directly to specific messages within a conversation. This feature can help you keep track of conversations with multiple people or topics in a single thread, and it can also help you avoid confusion or misunderstandings. If you're not currently using this feature, you're missing out on an essential tool for successful communication on the platform.

So, how do you respond to a specific message on Instagram? Here's the secret: you can simply long-press on the message you want to reply to, and a pop-up menu will appear. From there, you can select "Reply" to start typing your response directly underneath that specific message. Once you hit send, your reply will be displayed directly beneath the message you're responding to, making it clear who you're addressing and what message you're referring to.

One of the benefits of using this feature is that it helps keep threads organized, especially when multiple people are involved in a conversation. For example, suppose you're chatting with several potential clients or customers about different services or products your business offers. In that case, you can refer back to specific messages and respond to them individually, rather than trying to respond to every message in the thread at once.

Another benefit of using the reply-to-specific-message feature is that it can help prevent misunderstandings or miscommunications. For example, if someone asks you a direct question or makes a specific request, replying directly to that message indicates that you've seen the message and are addressing their concerns. If you forget to reply, or if your response gets lost in the thread, the other person might assume that you're ignoring them or that their message was unimportant.

In conclusion, if you're not currently using Instagram's reply-to-specific-message feature, you're missing out on an essential tool for successful communication on the platform. Practice using this feature to help keep your conversations organized and avoid misunderstandings. Happy messaging!

In Summary


There are multiple ways to reply to a specific message on Instagram on Android and iOS.
You can also reply to a specific message on the Instagram web app.
You need to update the app that supports cross-platform messaging.
Though the feature needs a cross-platform messaging update to support, you don’t have to link your accounts in order to reply to a specific message.







That said, here’s how to reply to a specific message on Instagram on Android, iOS, and the web.

 
## How to Reply to a Specific Message on Instagram on Android and iPhone


Both mobile operating systems have a similar procedure for responding to a given message.
1. Open the Instagram app on your phone and tap on the Messenger icon in the upper right corner of the home screen to open Instagram Direct Message. (If you see the old paper airplane logo instead of the Messenger logo, you’ll need to update the Instagram app for the feature to work.)

2. On the messages page, choose a conversation.
3. Find the message you want to reply to here and swipe it to the right until you see the reply icon. If you want to reply to your own message, swipe to the left so that the option appears. Now tap on the reply icon.

Alternatively, you can long-press on any message and tap on the Reply option at the bottom of the app to reply.

4. You can see that your selected message is linked to the text field. Now, you can type the message and tap on Send to send it as a reply message.

The message you replied to is displayed at the top of the reply message you sent. This way, everyone can easily see which message you have responded to. However, if you click on that message, you will not be taken back to the original message like you do on Whatsapp.

Once you have started replying, you can choose not to respond to that particular message by tapping the X icon in the linked message. This will remove the linked message and send your message as a normal message.


 
## How to Reply to a Specific Message on Instagram on the Web


The procedure for responding to a specific message differs from the web version.
1. Open instagram.com and tap on the Messager icon in the top bar.

2. Now select the conversation.
3. On the chat page, hover on any message you want to reply to.
4. Now click on the reply icon beside the message.

5. That’s it; the message you selected will be linked to the text box above. Now you can type the message and click Send, or press Enter to send the reply message.

Just like the mobile version, you can click the X icon if you don’t want to send your message as a reply message if you wish.

 
## Replying To Specific Messages on Instagram


Instagram actually offers two ways to reply to a particular message in mobile apps. You can either swipe right on the message and select the reply icon, or you can long-press on the message and select the reply option. Finally, you can simply type the message in both options and tap Send to reply to that message. In the desktop web version, you have to hover over the message and click the reply icon to send a reply message.
