The Infamous Shopkeeper in Spelunky 2 - Master the Art of Killing with These Top Tips!

Spelunky 2 is known for its challenging gameplay and difficult enemies, but perhaps none are more infamous than the shopkeepers. These aggressive merchants are not to be taken lightly and can quickly end any run if you're not prepared. In this guide, we'll be focusing on the infamous shopkeeper and how to master the art of killing them with some top tips.

Tip 1 - Avoid unnecessary confrontation

While you may be tempted to rob the shopkeeper and steal their wares, it's important to remember that they're not to be messed with. They're quick, aggressive, and deadly. If possible, it's best to avoid confrontation altogether. Purchase any necessary items, pay for them, and leave peacefully.

Tip 2 - Plan your attack

If you do find yourself in a situation where you need to take down a shopkeeper, it's crucial to plan your attack carefully. If you attack them head-on, they'll defend themselves and quickly end your run. Instead, use your surroundings to your advantage. Set traps, throw items to distract them, and plan a quick escape route.

Tip 3 - Use their own weapons against them

Shopkeepers are armed with shotguns, which can be deadly in the hands of a skilled player. However, they're also vulnerable to their own weapons. If you manage to disarm a shopkeeper, quickly grab their shotgun and use it to take them out. This can be a quick and efficient way to deal with them.

Tip 4 - Don't underestimate their strength

Shopkeepers may seem like easy targets at first glance, but they're tough and can take a lot of hits. It's important to remember that they're not to be underestimated. Don't let your guard down even if they appear to be weak.

Tip 5 - Be prepared to face the consequences

Finally, it's essential to be prepared to face the consequences of your actions. Killing a shopkeeper will result in the shopkeeper's hostility towards you for the rest of your run, making it more challenging than you might expect. Make sure you're ready to face the consequences before taking them out.

In conclusion, the infamous shopkeeper in Spelunky 2 is not to be messed with. But with the right planning and combat strategies, you can take them down and progress through the game with ease. Use these top tips to master the art of killing shopkeepers and become a Spelunky 2 master.
