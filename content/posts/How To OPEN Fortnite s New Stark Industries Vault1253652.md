Unlock Epic Loot! Discover The Top Secret Method To Access Stark Industries Vault In Fortnite!

Are you tired of grinding for hours on Fortnite, only to come up empty-handed when it comes to finding the best loot? Well, fear not, because we have discovered a top-secret method that will help you unlock the Stark Industries Vault and collect some truly epic loot.

As you may know, Stark Industries is one of the biggest POIs (Points of Interest) on Fortnite's map, and it's located in the northern part of the island. It's a heavily guarded area, with tough enemies, drones, and turrets. But the rewards are worth the risk!

So, how can you unlock the Stark Industries Vault? Here are the steps:

Step 1: Land at Stark Industries

The first thing you need to do is land at Stark Industries. You can either do this at the beginning of the game, or after you've gathered some loot and are ready for a fight. Be cautious, however, as there are other players who will be trying the same thing.

Step 2: Defeat the enemies

Once you've landed, you'll need to fight your way through the enemies. As mentioned, there are drones and turrets guarding the area, so be sure to take them out first. Then, take on the guards who are patrolling the area.

Tip: You can use the natural cover of the area to your advantage, such as the rocks and trees, to minimize damage and get a better angle on your enemies.

Step 3: Find the keycard

After you've defeated the enemies, it's time to find the keycard that will unlock the vault. The keycard can be found in one of two places: either on one of the guards, or inside a chest in the central building.

Tip: If you're having trouble finding the keycard, listen for the sound it emits. It makes a distinctive beeping noise that will lead you right to it.

Step 4: Activate the vault

Once you have the keycard, it's time to activate the vault. To do this, head over to the vault (which is located in the central building) and interact with the console. This will prompt you to swipe the keycard, which will then unlock the vault.

Step 5: Collect the loot

Finally, it's time to collect the loot that's inside the vault! This is the best part, as you'll find some truly epic weapons, items, and materials.

Tip: Be sure to keep an eye out for other players who may be attracted by the sound of the vault opening. It's best to have some backup or to be ready for a fight.

In conclusion, unlocking the Stark Industries Vault is a challenging but rewarding experience. It's an excellent opportunity to get some of the best loot in the game, and it requires some strategy, skill, and luck. So, the next time you're playing Fortnite, head over to Stark Industries, and see if you can unlock the vault for yourself!

Fortnite has been loaded with many updates and challenges in Season 4. Just like Doom’s Domain, there’s a new locked vault added in the game for the players to explore and collect loot from within. The location of this new vault is in the Stark Industries. To open this new vault in the game, you will require a keycard. Follow this guide to know how to get the keycard and open Fortnite’s new Stark Industries vault.
 
## How to Open New Stark Industries Vault in Fortnite
 
The keycard to the vault is guarded by the owner himself. Yes, you hear it right. You will have to take down Iron Man himself to get the keycard. But it’s simple said than done. Iron Man has a lot of health and his attacks can take a lion’s toll from your life bar. Also, there will be the Stark bots around to increase your worries. However, there’s an easy way to eliminate Iron Man in Fortnite.
 
All you need to do is fight him from a higher viewpoint. Collect a rifle or similar weapon while making your way to the Stark Industries. You can also attempt to get a Strak industries rifle. Then, build a few ramps and get to the second floor in the building. Next, find a vantage point where you can easily aim Iron Man and also take cover when necessary.
 
This will help you easily eliminate Iron Man and open Fortnite’s new Stark Industries vault. Once Iron Man is defeated, he will drop a keycard and some other loots. Collect the keycard and get out of the building. Now, you need to locate the vault which is a nearby small building. Find the vault and access it with the keycard to get all the valuable loots inside it.
 
That’s how you defeat Iron Man and open Fortnite’s new Stark Industries vault. This will get you awesome rewards that will help you progress quickly in the game. Another way to progress quickly is by earning XPs by completing various challenges in Fortnite. You can complete Don a Disguise challenge and the Gnom Talk secret challenge to get a decent amount of XP in Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 4.
