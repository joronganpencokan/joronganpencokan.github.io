# Discover the One Simple Hack to Convert MP4 to AVI on Ubuntu and Play on Any DVD Player!

Have you ever recorded or downloaded a video in the MP4 format but couldn't play it on your DVD player? Don't worry; you are not alone! Most DVD players don't support the MP4 format, which means you'll need to convert it to a compatible format like AVI. This article will guide you on how to convert MP4 to AVI on Ubuntu and play it on any DVD player.

## Why Convert MP4 to AVI?

AVI (Audio Video Interleave) is a standard video format that works on most DVD players. On the other hand, MP4 (MPEG-4) is a highly compressed format that's optimized for online streaming and mobile devices. While MP4 has become the most popular video format, it's not compatible with some DVD players. That's why you need to convert your MP4 videos to AVI format to enjoy them on any DVD player without any problem.

## How to Convert MP4 to AVI on Ubuntu

On Ubuntu, you can use the Handbrake application to convert videos from one format to another. Here's how to convert MP4 to AVI using Handbrake:

1. Install Handbrake: If you don't have Handbrake installed on your Ubuntu system, you'll need to download and install it first. You can download Handbrake from the Ubuntu Software Center.

2. Launch Handbrake: Launch the Handbrake application from the Ubuntu Dash or Menu.

3. Select the Input File: Click on the "Source" button and select the MP4 file you want to convert.

4. Set Output Format: Click on the "Output Settings" button and select the AVI container from the dropdown menu.

5. Choose Output Directory: Click on the "Browse" button and select the directory where you want to save the converted AVI file.

6. Start Conversion: Click on the "Start Encode" button to begin the conversion process. Depending on the size of your MP4 file, the conversion process may take several minutes.

And that's it! You've successfully converted your MP4 file to AVI format. The converted file should be saved in the directory you selected.

## How to Play AVI on Any DVD Player

Now that you have converted your MP4 file to AVI format, you can play it on any DVD player that supports the AVI format. Here's how to play AVI on a DVD player:

1. Burn the AVI File to DVD: Use any DVD burning software to burn the AVI file to a DVD.

2. Insert the DVD: Once you've burnt the AVI file to DVD, insert the DVD into your DVD player.

3. Play the DVD: Your DVD player should automatically detect the DVD and start playing the AVI file.

And that's it! You can now enjoy your MP4 videos on any DVD player by converting them to AVI format and burning them to a DVD. 

Wrapping Up

In conclusion, converting MP4 to AVI on Ubuntu is easy and straightforward using the Handbrake application. By converting your MP4 files to AVI format, you can play them on any DVD player that supports the AVI format.

Are you an avid downloader of videos and movies (legally) online? Do you prefer to watch movies on your DVD player? It turns out, many people prefer to experience a good movie while relaxing on a sofa and watching it on a television screen. Unfortunately, if you have an older DVD player, you won’t be able to play MP4 videos directly from a USB or other external media.
 
The reason for this is that the standard AAC audio codec is incompatible with DVD players due to license restrictions. On the other hand, the MP3 audio codec is universally accepted. The open source version of DivX video codec is Xvid (essentially DivX spelled backwards) and is accepted by many DVD players including older ones displaying the DivX logo.
 
For Windows and Mac users, there are numerous applications to convert MP4 files and other formats into AVI format which older DVD players can play back. The story is different on Linux. There aren’t as many solutions and the process to actually get it done is sometimes too technical.
 
This MakeTechEasier solution is actually quite easy. Enter WinFF, a free open source video converter published under the GNU public license v3. It is cross platform and can be used on both Linux and Windows and supports several languages. Below is a tutorial on how to install and use WinFF in Ubuntu (Trusty Tahr).
 
## Downloading and Installing WinFF
 

 
WinFF is available in the Ubuntu Software Center. Just launch your software center and type “WinFF” in the search bar. Take note that the application has certain dependencies that must be installed to make it work. One of thes is the libavcodec package, which can be obtained by installing the unstripped version of libavcodec-extra as suggested by WinFF during installation.
 
If you are running an old version of Ubuntu, you will have to install the WinFF Personal Package Archive (PPA) provided by Launchpad. Open a terminal window using “Ctrl + Alt + T” and type:
 
After that, update your system:
 
Install WinFF:
 
Lastly, install the unstripped version of libavcodec:
 
## Converting Videos with WinFF
 
WinFF is a versatile application that can convert single files or multiple files in multiple formats all at the same time. To begin conversion, launch the application by going to your launcher and typing “WinFF.” Click the icon to launch.
 
The interface is fairly straightforward and user friendly as shown below.
 
To start the conversion, select “AVI” from the drop-down menu of the “convert to” field. Next, select the preset from the options available – for example, xvid anarmorphic widescreen. Your choice will depend on your original video’s aspect ratio.
 
Next, click “Add” and browse your computer to find the video you want to convert. Select the output folder where you want the converted video to be saved. This could be an external flash drive which you can insert into the DVD player to watch the converted video.
 
Finally, click “Convert,” and a terminal window will pop up. All you have to do now is sit back and wait for the video to convert. The time taken will depend on the size of your video and processing power of your computer.
 
WinFF provides a variety of preset conversion settings for common formats and devices. These presets are intended to provide the best results for each individual codec. They have been designed to ensure the best quality, and unless you really know what you are doing, I don’t recommend tinkering with the presets.
