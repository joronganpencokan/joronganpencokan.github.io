Introduction:

The delay of the highly anticipated game, Halo Infinite, has been the talk of the gaming world for quite some time now. Originally slated to release alongside the Xbox Series X in November 2020, the game had to be postponed due to various reasons. While the official release date is yet to be announced, recent rumors suggest that it may not be until 2023.

Body:

Halo Infinite is supposed to be a major release for Microsoft's Xbox. The game is expected to outrank all the previous Halo games, and Microsoft is banking on it to be a major hit. However, the recent rumors about the release date have caused a lot of anxiety among gamers, who have been eagerly waiting for the next installment in the Halo franchise.

So, what could be the reason behind the potential delay of Halo Infinite? There are several theories circulating online. One theory is that the developers 343 Industries are facing difficulties in optimizing the game for the Xbox Series X hardware, which requires a lot of work due to the console's unique architecture. Another theory suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the game's development process, causing unexpected delays.

Another theory is that Microsoft wants to release Halo Infinite alongside a new Xbox console, as it did with the Xbox One and the original Halo game. This would provide an added incentive for gamers to purchase the new console, boosting its sales. However, with the current console's launch in 2020 and no new console in the works, this theory seems less likely.

Conclusion:

The delay of Halo Infinite has been disappointing for gamers who have been eagerly waiting for the game. However, as the developers continue to work on the game, it's safe to say that the final product will be worth the wait. While the exact release date may still be unclear, Microsoft has promised that the game will not release until it's fully polished and ready for gamers to play.

In conclusion, the ongoing pandemic and hardware compatibility issues could very well be the reasons behind the delay of Halo Infinite. Still, one can hope that the game releases sooner than the rumored 2023. Until then, gamers can look forward to other upcoming Xbox titles and enjoy the previous Halo games for a nostalgic experience.

Halo Infinite on the cusp of being delayed for another year. After the somewhat disastrous showcase during Xbox Games Showcase, it now looks like that 343 Industries might not be able to deliver Halo Infinite by the time Xbox Series X launches.
 
An anonymous person posted on 4chan stating that a huge fight broke out in 2019 which led to a lot of lead people leaving the 343 Studios and Microsoft had to bring in people from Bungie who were the creators of the Halo franchise.
 
This led to numerous conflicts of interest which led to increasing conflicts between Bungie and 343 Industries and Bungie left midway through the development of Halo Infinite.
 
Issues were reminiscent of that of BioWare’s Anthem and just like that a lot of confusion at the top rendered the development of the game in a lot of issues, from no core idea stemming out of it.
 
There is a possibility of 343 being taken off from the development of Halo Infinite and the entire project being offered to Bungie once again. Microsoft is desperate in not wanting to make the same mistakes and deliver another disappointment like Halo: Guardians.
 

 
While this seems plausible, there is a huge chance that this might not come true but as we have seen in recent times that work crunch issues and a lack of vision have derailed the production of major AAA titles costing millions of dollars and a lot of people losing their jobs.
 
We couldn’t confirm nor deny the authenticity of this news but, after the Xbox Games Showcase gameplay demo, it seems like there have been some issues affecting the development of Halo Infinite.
 
Halo Infinite has been in development from 2015 right after Halo Reach was released and with a lackluster performance, it is possible that Microsoft wouldn’t want to rush the game to deliver a half baked product which does not live up to the Halo brand.
 
Halo is one of the biggest videogame franchises in the world with Microsoft making it their biggest brand to push the next-gen consoles.
