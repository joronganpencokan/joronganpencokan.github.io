Are you tired of missing those perfect photo moments because it takes forever to pull up your camera app? Well, there's a hidden feature on Android that allows you to launch your camera with just one click of the home button. 

Here's how to add this feature to your Android device:

Step 1: Download a third-party camera app that supports this feature. Some popular choices include Camera MX, Open Camera, and Camera360.

Step 2: Go to your device's settings and select "Accessibility."

Step 3: Scroll down to the "Services" section and select "Camera shortcut."

Step 4: Enable the camera shortcut and select the camera app you downloaded in Step 1.

And there you have it! With just one click of your home button, you can now launch your camera app and capture all your favorite moments. 

But wait, there's more! Some newer Android devices actually have this feature built-in, so no need to download a third-party app. Just go to your device's settings, select "System", and then "Gestures". From there, you can select "Swipe up on Home button" to launch your camera. 

This hidden feature may seem small, but it can make a big difference in capturing those precious moments. So what are you waiting for? Unlock this feature and start snapping away!

While some smartphones have a dedicated button to launch the camera app, the others require you to launch the camera app manually from the App Drawer (or homescreen). Android is known for the customization options it offers, and there is now a way for you to make the home button on your Android smartphone launch the camera app. That way you will not have to struggle with the menu system on your device, and you will be able to launch the camera much quicker than launching it the traditional way.
 
If you are in a hurry, and you wish to capture that really great moment, you will be able to do that by just pressing the menu button and launching the camera app. It would be much faster than if you opened the app from the app drawer.
 
Here’s how you can go about making the home button launch the Camera on your Android device:
 
## Making the Home Button Launch the Camera in Android
 
In order to accomplish the task, you will have to download a free app called Home2 Shortcut from the Google Play store on your device. It is a free little app so shouldn’t take too long to download.
 
Once the app is installed, launch it from your app drawer.
 
When the app launches, scroll down and tap on the button that says “Choose Application.” It lets you choose what app you want to open when the Home button is pressed.
 

 
You should see a prompt that asks you what app you want to assign to the Home button. Tap on “Installed Applications,” as that is where the Camera app is located.
 
Scroll down and tap on the “Camera” option. Then hit “OK.”  Here you are choosing the app that will be launched when you press the Home button.
 
You will be thrown back to the main screen of the app. Scroll down to “Step2” and you should see a drop-down menu that says “Normal.” It lets you select the double tap interval for your home button. Make sure it says “Normal,” as that is how it will work properly.
 
Scroll down to “Step3.” Here you need to tell the app what launcher you are using on your device. Tap on “Choose Home Application” and select your launcher then hit “OK.” It should notify the app about your launcher.
 
Om “Step4,” tap on the button that says “Close.” You will be prompted to select a launcher that you wish to use to complete the action. Tap on “Home2 Shortcut,” and then tap “Always.” It will now use the selected (Home2) launcher on your device. It needs to do this so that the Home button can be used to launch the camera app.
 
You are all set.
 
From now on, a double-tap on your Home button should launch the camera app on your device.
 
## Conclusion
 
If you have always wanted a dedicated camera button on your device, the above walkaround can help you set one up. As you can tell the app can be used to launch other applications as well, so if Camera is not what you want, you can switch it to another app of your preference.
