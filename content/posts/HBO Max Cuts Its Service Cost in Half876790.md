# You Won't Believe What HBO Max Just Did to Its Subscription Price!

In a surprising move, HBO Max has announced a major change in its subscription price, leaving many people stunned. The popular streaming service, which launched last year, has decided to cut its monthly subscription price by almost 20%.

This announcement comes as a big surprise to many, as HBO Max was known for being one of the more expensive streaming services on the market, with a price tag of $14.99 per month. However, the new price will be $9.99 per month, making it one of the cheapest options available.

The decision to lower the price has been met with a lot of positivity from subscribers who have been enjoying the service since its launch. Many have lauded HBO Max for this move, noting that it will make the service more accessible to a wider audience.

In a statement, HBO Max's Chief Revenue Officer, Jessica Holscott, said, "We are excited to offer our subscribers a new, more affordable price for our service. Our goal has always been to offer the best content in the world, and we believe that by lowering the price, we can make that content more accessible to everyone."

This move by HBO Max is a direct response to the growing competition in the streaming industry. With more and more companies entering the fray, it has become increasingly important for streaming services to stand out and offer greater value to attract and retain customers.

The price cut is not the only change that HBO Max has made recently. The company has also announced plans to increase the amount of content available on the platform. This includes a range of new programming, as well as popular shows like Friends, which were previously only available on other streaming platforms.

Overall, this is a big win for HBO Max and its subscribers. The price cut will make the service more accessible to a wider audience, while the increased content will offer greater value to customers. As the streaming market continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how other companies respond to these changes, and whether or not they will follow in HBO Max's footsteps.

HBO Max is cutting the cost of its subscription service in half for some customers starting Friday in a deal will run through September 26.

 

Prospective customers either can sign up at the HBO Max website or through certain distribution partners: Apple, Google, LG, Microsoft, or Sony. Users also can sign up via their Roku device or Vizio SmartCast TV.

 

The promotion does not extend to other streaming partners like YouTube TV or Hulu.

 

The departure will result in many users canceling subscriptions, with some experts speculating around 5 million users will leave. The price cut is HBO trying to recuperate its losses from the fallout.

 

After the six month trial ends, new HBO Max users will have to pay the full $15 monthly subscription cost. The service is currently one of the most expensive on the market, even with the ad-supported $10 subscription.
