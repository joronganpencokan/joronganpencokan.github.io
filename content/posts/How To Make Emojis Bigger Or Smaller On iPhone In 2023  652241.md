In 2016, Apple launched iOS 10. The new OS brought with it a host of new features to the iPhone such as Memories for photos, new ways to use Siri and the focus of this article, the ability to create and send larger emojis. Now iPhone users can easily send bigger emojis.
 
### Make Emojis Bigger In The Messages App

When you want big emojis, you must send them separately without text. This is because emojis are automatically adjusted to fit the size of the text when you send them with text. 
 
You can send up to three emojis at once and they’ll be displayed as larger than usual. Once it goes beyond three, then they will appear as normal size.
 
To process is simple and you don’t even need to go into the Settings app to get bigger emojis. Here’s how to get them in the text messaging app:
 
- To try this for yourself, open the Message app and select a chat. On your keyboard, tap the globe icon or smiley face to access the emoji keyboard.

 
- With the emoji keyboard, you can send your favorite emoji. To see a bigger emoji, send one emoji by itself.

 
- As mentioned before, the large emojis only work for 1 – 3 emojis sent by themselves. To see this in action, send emojis by themselves.

 
- Lastly, send four emojis by themselves and you’ll see that they appear as normal size rather than as big emojis.
