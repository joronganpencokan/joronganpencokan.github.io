# Unbelievable! Discover the Hidden Secret to Mastering Excel Spreadsheets with the Power of Filters!

Are you an Excel enthusiast struggling to manage and make sense of your spreadsheets? Look no further as we reveal the powerful tool of filters that will transform your Excel experience.

Filters in Excel are the most underrated feature, yet when mastered, they have the power to simplify complex spreadsheets and save time. Filters allow you to sort and filter data in place, making it easier to see what's important and quickly narrow down large datasets.

To begin, let's take a step back and talk about what filters are. Filters are essentially a tool or technique that allows you to select, sort and display specific data in a spreadsheet while hiding all irrelevant data.

With filters, you can easily find relevant information from a large dataset, such as finding all orders that were made in a particular month or finding all the suppliers of a particular product. Filters also allow you to sort data into ascending or descending order, making it easy to see the highest or lowest values.

Here's how to start using filters in Excel:

Step 1: Select the data set to be filtered.

Step 2: Go to the "Data" tab on the ribbon at the top of the sheet and click on "Filter."

Step 3: You'll see drop-down arrows appear in the header row of each column of data once you've turned on the filter. Click on these arrows to display a list of filtering options such as text filtering, number filtering, date filtering, and more.

Step 4: Choose the condition you want to apply to filter one or more columns. For example, you might choose to filter by a particular color in a box, by the number of products sold or the date a sale was made.

Step 5: Once done, you'll see only the data that meets your particular conditions. You can also clear or remove the filter one column at a time or do it for the whole table.

That's not all. Advanced Excel users can also use multiple filters to perform more complex operations such as creating pivot tables, using functions and formulas, among other things.

With filters in Excel, you can easily work with large data sets, organize data according to specific criteria, apply formulas, and reduce errors in your work. You can also create visually meaningful illustrations or charts out of the filtered datasets for a clear interpretation of data that you can easily understand and use in your day-to-day operations.

In conclusion, filters are an incredibly powerful tool whose benefits exceed the time they save. They allow users to organize and sift through data quickly and easily, reducing errors, and increasing productivity. Once you've mastered filters, you'll be amazed at how much quicker and clearer you can make sense of complex spreadsheets. So what are you waiting for? Set up and master filters to your spreadsheets today and start making Excel work for you!

##   How Filtering Works  
 
##   Best Practices for Filtering  
 

Save yourself some hassle by following best-practice guidelines for working with filtered data:

 

Open the spreadsheet that contains the data you want to filter.

 

If the Home tab isn't already displayed, on the ribbon select Home. In the Editing group, select Sort & Filter > Filter.

 

Each header in your spreadsheet now displays a small drop-down arrow. Select an arrow to filter by the information in that column. A filtering dialog box appears.

 

Select Number Filters or Text Filters to see options for filtering your data.

 

Continuing the example from above, as the sales manager you want to select those salespeople whose Q4 earnings were more than $19,500. From the options menu, select Greater Than.

 

In the Custom AutoFilter dialog box, in the Greater Than field, type 19,500. Select OK.

 

Excel displays only the records whose Q4 values are greater than $19,500.

 
Notice in the number column to the far left there are double lines between line numbers if rows of data aren't displayed between those rows. Also, notice that the down arrow in the Q4 header now displays a filter icon to show data is being filtered based on data in that column.
 

If you want to filter data a different way, go back to step 5 and choose a different selection from the menu. Then, follow the screen prompts to filter your data the way you want.

 

To remove the filter, select the same filter arrow and choose Clear Filter.

 
- Unless there's a good reason for it, don't save a shared spreadsheet with filters active. Other users may not notice that the file is filtered.Although you can filter on several columns simultaneously, these filters are additive, not exclusive. In other words, filtering a contact list to show everyone in the State of California who are older than age 60 will yield everyone who's over 60 in California. Such a filter will not show you the all of 60-year-olds or all of the Californians in your spreadsheet.Text filters only work as well as the underlying data allows. Inconsistent data leads to misleading or incorrect filtered results. For example, filtering for people who live in Illinois will not catch records for people who live in "IL" or in misspelled "Ilinois."

 
Use caution when sorting filtered data. Sorting partially filtered data may cause a restructuring of the data file, which can lead to additional problems. If you must sort a filtered dataset, copy the filtered data to a new worksheet and then sort it.
