In today's digital age, group texts have become a common mode of communication. With just a few taps on your smartphone, you can send a message to multiple people at once. However, the constant barrage of notifications from group texts can quickly become overwhelming, leaving you feeling stressed and anxious. If you're tired of being bombarded with messages from group texts, there's good news - a secret trick has been revealed that can finally help you escape these conversations and win back your sanity.

The key to breaking free from group texts is a simple feature that most people don't know about: the ability to mute notifications. This feature allows you to silence notifications from a specific conversation or individual, so you can still receive messages but won't be constantly bombarded with alerts and distractions.

To mute notifications on an iPhone, follow these steps:

1. Open the group text conversation you want to mute.
2. Tap the "i" button in the top right corner.
3. Scroll down to "Hide Alerts" and toggle the switch to green.

On an Android phone, the process is similar:

1. Open the group text conversation you want to mute.
2. Tap and hold the conversation.
3. Tap "Mute notifications" in the pop-up menu.

Once you've muted notifications from a group text, you can still check the conversation at your own convenience. This allows you to stay up-to-date on what's going on without being constantly interrupted throughout the day.

Another option is to simply leave the group text altogether. This can be a drastic step, but it's a good solution if the conversation is no longer relevant to you or if you're receiving too many messages that aren't important. To leave a group text on an iPhone, follow these steps:

1. Open the group text conversation you want to leave.
2. Tap the "i" button in the top right corner.
3. Scroll down to "Leave this Conversation" and tap it.

On an Android phone, the process is similar:

1. Open the group text conversation you want to leave.
2. Tap and hold the conversation.
3. Tap "Leave group" in the pop-up menu.

By muting notifications or leaving group texts, you can finally win back your sanity and reduce the anxiety and stress caused by constant digital distractions. Don't be afraid to take control of your notifications and prioritize your mental health - your productivity and well-being will thank you for it.

This article explains how to leave or mute group texts in Android and iOS. Instructions apply to standard iOS 12/Android 8 and above unless otherwise noted.

 
###

Tap Group > Information > Leave This Conversation.To mute in iOS, open group text > tap the group of contacts > Information > Hide Alerts.

 
##   How to Escape a Group Text on Android  
 

The following instructions apply to the stock messages app on Android. If your Android phone uses a different texting app, for example, Messages on the Samsung phone or Google Messages, the process for leaving a group text may be different.

 
On an Android device, you can't leave a group text without asking to be removed, but you can choose to mute notifications.
 
- Navigate to the group text.
 - Tap the three vertical dots.
 - Tap the bell to mute the conversation.
 - You will not see any more messages in the group text unless you go back and tap the bell again to accept them. At that point, the messages you missed will populate the conversation.

 
##   Leave a Group Text on an iPhone  
 

If you have an iPhone, you have a few options for muting unwanted group texts.

 

Navigate to the group text.

 

Tap the three vertical dots.

 

Tap the bell to mute the conversation.

 

You will not see any more messages in the group text unless you go back and tap the bell again to accept them. At that point, the messages you missed will populate the conversation.

 
###   Option 1: Mute Notifications  
 

The first option on iOS is to mute group text notifications:

 
- Open the group text you want to mute.
 - Go to the top of the screen and tap the group of contacts.
 - Tap the Information button (it's located under the group).
 - Scroll to the bottom and tap the Hide Alerts toggle to turn it On.

 

When you select Hide Alerts (or Do Not Disturb in iOS 11 or earlier), you won't get a notification (and the accompanying text sound) each time someone in the group text sends a new message. To view all new messages in the thread, open the group text. This method cuts down on distractions.

 

Open the group text you want to mute.

 

Go to the top of the screen and tap the group of contacts.

 

Tap the Information button (it's located under the group).

 

Scroll to the bottom and tap the Hide Alerts toggle to turn it On.

 
###   Option 2: Leave a Group Text on iOS  
 

The way to really leave the conversation is easy but this isn't always an option even if you're using the Messages app on your iPhone.

 

To leave a group text on iOS, you'll need the following circumstances:

 
- You must be in an iMessage conversation rather than a standard group text message. If some of the people in the group chat use Android phones or other apps rather than Messages on iOS, you'll be in a standard group message and the option to leave a group text through Messages isn't available.There must be at least four people in a group text. The logic being that if you were to leave a three-person conversation, it would no longer be a group text but rather a simple text between two people. In any case, if you're in a three-person iMessage chat, the Leave this Conversation option is grayed out.

 

If you are able to leave a group text on iOS, follow these instructions:

 
- Open the group iMessage you want to leave.
 - Tap the group at the top, then the Information button.
 - Scroll down and tap Leave this Conversation.
 - Tap Leave this Conversation to confirm you choice.

 

Open the group iMessage you want to leave.

 

Tap the group at the top, then the Information button.

 

Scroll down and tap Leave this Conversation.

 

Tap Leave this Conversation to confirm you choice.
