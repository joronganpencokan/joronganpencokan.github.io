Windows offers built-in support for mounting and burning image files using the File Explorer app. Here's how to mount and burn an ISO file to a DVD in Windows 8 and later.

 
##   ISO Burning vs. Mounting  
 

ISO files, also called disc image files, contain an exact copy of a disc, whatever that disc may contain. When you burn an ISO file to a DVD, you are creating an exact duplicate of the original disc, not just the files on it. If the original is bootable, the copy will be too; if the original includes copyright protections, the copy will too.

 
Instructions in this article apply to Windows 10, Windows 8.1, and Windows 8.
 

When you mount a disc image file, Windows creates a virtual drive for your ISO file as though it were a physical disc. This allows you to watch the movie, listen to the music, or install the application from the file without ever having to burn the data to a disc.
