# Unlock the Secret to Streamlining Your Workload: Master the Art of Creating Google Sheets Templates!

As a busy professional, you know that time is one of your most valuable resources. You need to make every second count in order to stay on top of your work and meet your deadlines. That's why it's so important to find ways to streamline your workload and make your job easier. One of the best ways to do this is by mastering the art of creating Google Sheets Templates.

Google Sheets is a powerful tool that can help you organize your work and simplify your job. But if you're like most people, you use the same spreadsheets over and over again, copying and pasting data from one file to another. This can be time-consuming and tedious, and it can slow you down when you need to get tasks done quickly.

Creating templates in Google Sheets is the answer to this problem. By creating a template, you can quickly and easily create new spreadsheets that are customized to your needs. You don't have to waste time copying and pasting data or formatting cells. Everything is already set up for you, and all you need to do is enter your data.

Here's how to create a template in Google Sheets:

1. Open a new Google Sheet.

2. Enter your data and format your cells as you want them.

3. Click on "File" in the top menu and select "Make a copy."

4. Rename the copy and click "OK."

5. Close the original sheet.

6. You now have a template that you can use for future projects.

Once you've created your template, you can use it over and over again. When you need to create a new spreadsheet, simply open your template and rename it. Then you can enter your data and save the new file.

Creating templates in Google Sheets can save you a lot of time and make your job easier. You can customize your templates to fit your specific needs, and you can easily share them with others in your organization. So why not start creating your own templates today and unlock the power of Google Sheets?

This article explains how to create your own template in Google Sheets when one of the Google Sheets pre-supplied templates won't work. You'll need a Google account to access Google Sheets. Sign in to Google Sheets with the same account you use to access Gmail or YouTube.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Make a spreadsheet with the data and formatting for a template. In a new folder, click New > Google Sheets to make an empty Sheet.In the source spreadsheet, highlight and copy the content you want to use in the template. Paste it into the empty spreadsheet.Name and save the template. When you want to use this custom template, make a copy so you don't change the original template file.

 
##   What You Need for a Custom Google Sheets Template  
 

A Google Sheets custom template contains information specific to the spreadsheet you want to make. To make a custom template, start with a spreadsheet file that contains the information and formatting you want to use in the template.

 

Create the spreadsheet file in any spreadsheet program, such as LibreOffice or Microsoft Excel. You can even make the spreadsheet in Google Sheets, either from scratch or from the Template Gallery. Just open one of those templates and edit it as needed to fit your project.

 
##   Make a Folder for Custom Templates  
 

To keep your custom templates organized, create a folder that will contain only template files.

 
- Open Google Drive and go to the root folder (the top folder and not a subfolder).
 - Select New > Folder.
 - In the New folder dialog box, enter a descriptive name for the folder, then select Create.
 - The new folder appears in the list with the other folders in Google Drive.

 
##   Add Your Template to the Folder  
 

To add your custom template to the newly created folder:

 

Open Google Drive and go to the root folder (the top folder and not a subfolder).

 

Select New > Folder.

 

In the New folder dialog box, enter a descriptive name for the folder, then select Create.

 

The new folder appears in the list with the other folders in Google Drive.

 
- Open the templates folder you created.
 - Select New > Google Sheets to make an empty spreadsheet that will be used as the template file.
 - If you select From a template, the Google Sheets Template Gallery displays. You cannot upload templates or create a blank template from the Template Gallery.

##   Use Your Custom Templates

Open the templates folder you created.

 

Select New > Google Sheets to make an empty spreadsheet that will be used as the template file.

 
If you select From a template, the Google Sheets Template Gallery displays. You cannot upload templates or create a blank template from the Template Gallery.

Select Edit > Copy to copy the highlighted content. Or, press Ctrl+C or Command+C.

 

Open the empty spreadsheet you made in Step 2 and select Edit > Paste to paste the spreadsheet contents. Or, press Ctrl+V or Command+V.
