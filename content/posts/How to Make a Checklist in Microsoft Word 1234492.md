2. A checklist ensures that you don't forget anything.

When you have a lot of tasks to complete, it's easy to forget something important. By using a checklist, you can ensure that you don't overlook anything essential. You can also use your checklist as a reference to make sure you're completing everything you need to do.

3. A checklist helps you track your progress and celebrate your accomplishments.

As you complete tasks on your checklist, you get a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. By tracking your progress, you can see how far you've come and reward yourself for a job well done. This positive feedback loop can help you stay motivated and productive.

In conclusion, creating a checklist in Microsoft Word is an easy yet powerful way to revolutionize your productivity. By harnessing the organizational power of a checklist, you can prioritize your tasks, ensure that you don't forget anything, and track your progress. So what are you waiting for?

## How to Make a Checklist Using Bullet Points
 
One of the easiest ways to add a checkbox in your Word document is with bullet points. The option to do this is not visible by default. You will have to add the checkbox style to the bulleted list before you can use it in your documents.
 
Note: checkboxes that are added using bullet points aren’t clickable – you cannot check or uncheck them digitally. They’re best suited for printable documents.
 
Follow the steps below to use bullet points to add a checkbox to your Microsoft Word document
 
- Go to the “Home” tab in your Word document.
 - Click on the downward arrow next to the bullet list toolbar button and select “Define New Bullet” from the menu.

 
- Click on the “Symbol” button in the window that shows.

 
- Click on the drop-down box next to “Font” in the Symbol window that appears and select “Wingdings 2.”

- Type “163” in the “Character code” box to quickly find the checkbox symbol. Select it and click the “Ok” button. You can also find and use other signs, like a circle, for your checkbox.

 
- You need to perform the above steps only once. After adding the checkbox to the bullet list options, you can insert it anytime into your document by clicking on the downward arrow next to the bullet list in the “Home” tab and selecting the “checkbox bullet” from the list.

 
- The checkbox will be added to your document.

## How to Insert a Checklist Using Developer Options
 
If you want to add checkboxes that can be used digitally to a Word document, you will have to use the “Check Box Control” feature in the Developer tab. This method allows you to customize what can be entered into the checkbox.
 
We have broken down the steps to add an editable checklist into three sections for easier understanding.
 
### 1. Enable the Developer Tab
 
First, enable Developer options in Microsoft Word as shown below. This is a one-time requirement.
 
- Click on the “File” tab at the top.

 
- Go to “Options” in the sidebar.

 
- Click on “Customize Ribbon” in the sidebar and select “Main Tabs” from the “Customize the Ribbon” drop-down menu.

 
- Scroll down the available list, check the box next to “Developer,” then click on the “OK” button to save the change. You will see the Developer option in the top bar.

 
Note: to add the Developer tab on macOS, go to “Word Menu → Preferences,” select “Ribbon & toolbar → Customize the ribbon → Main tabs,” then check the Developer box and save the changes.
 
### 2. Add Check Box Control
 
After enabling the Developer options, follow these steps to add an interactive checkbox to your document:
 
- Click on the “Developer” tab in the top bar of your document.

 
- Place your cursor in the location where you want to add a checkbox, then click on the “Check Box” icon in the Controls section.

 
That’s it. A checkbox will show up in the document. You can click on it to fill the checkbox.
 
### 3. Customize Check Box Control
 
By default, if you click on a checkbox, it will get filled with an “X.” You can keep this behavior as it is, but if you wish to choose a different symbol to fill the checkbox, follow the steps below.
 
- Click on the checkbox that you added to your document to select it.

 
- Click on the “Properties” option in the Controls section under the Developer tab.

 
- In the Content Control Properties window, click on the “Change” button next to “Checked symbol” under Check Box Properties.

 
- Choose the desired symbol from the list. If you want to set a checkmark inside a box, search for character code 82 in Wingdings 2 in the Symbol window, select it, then click “OK” to save the changes.

 
Tip: Working on a document late at night? Be sure to enable dark mode in Word.
