# Turn Your Phone into a Movie Theater: Learn How to Make a DIY Smartphone Projector!

Are you bored of watching movies or videos on your small phone screen? Do you want to have a movie theater experience without spending much on projectors? Then, a DIY smartphone projector is just what you need! It's an easy and cheap way to turn your phone into a larger screen, providing you with a cinematic experience right in your room.

Here's what you need to know to create your DIY smartphone projector.

## Materials Required

- A shoebox or any box
- A magnifying glass (size depends on the box dimensions)
- X-Acto knife or scissors
- Ruler
- Black matte paint or black construction paper
- Tape or glue
- A smartphone

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Box Preparation

Begin by cutting a rectangular hole near the top of the box lid, leaving at least 1 inch of space from the edges of the box. This step is where you'll place the magnifying glass. Make sure the rectangular hole is parallel to the shorter sides of the box.

### Step 2: Glue the Magnifying Glass

Now, fix the magnifying glass onto the rectangular hole you just made in the box lid. To do this, apply some glue onto the edge of the magnifying glass and stick it onto the rectangular hole from the top of the lid. Remember to make sure that the magnifying glass sits in place vertically.

### Step 3: Painting or Papering

Next, paint the inside of the box black or attach black construction paper to the interior sides of the box. This will ensure that the image on the phone is the only image projected onto the wall.

### Step 4: Phone Placement

Place your phone inside the box, with the screen facing the lens. The ideal distance between the phone and the lens is the same as the distance between the magnifying glass and the screen. You may have to tilt the phone to adjust the image size and focus.

### Step 5: Projection

Turn off the lights and point the box toward a blank wall or projection screen. Align the picture on your phone, and you'll see it displayed on the wall in front of you.

## Final Thoughts

Now you have your very own DIY smartphone projector. Remember, however, that the quality of the image displayed on the wall will depend on the quality of the magnifying glass and the ambient light in the room. This DIY projector is perfect for a movie night in with friends or family, but it won't provide a high-quality projection for presentations or anything similar. 

So, why wait? Grab the materials and create your inexpensive and straightforward DIY smartphone projector today! Watch your favorite movies or videos on a larger screen, and enjoy the cinema experience right in your own home.

You can build your own DIY smartphone projector with a few simple craft materials. This article explains what you need and how to put it all together.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- You'll need a few simple craft materials, including a shoebox, a large magnifying glass lens, and foamcore or stiff cardboard.Be sure your lens is not a fresnel lens (texture on one side, smooth on the other.) These don't work as well.Before you start, write down the length, depth, and width of the shoebox.

 
##   What You Need to Make a Smartphone Projector  
 

Get into one place each of the following:

 
- A shoebox, or a photo box from a crafting store.A smartphone or small tablet.Measuring tape.A large magnifier that will fit in one end of the box. The bigger the lens, the better, especially if you have a large wall you want to project on. Also, try to avoid lenses with handles, if possible, to save on cutting.Foamcore or stiff cardboard.A cutting tool such as an Xacto knife or box cutter.A flashlight.Masking tape or double-sided tape with a washable adhesive.A strong glue.A clean, white, smooth surface, like a tightly strung sheet or a blank wall that's been cleaned.

 

Before you start, write down the length, depth, and width of the box and use that information in the next steps.

 
##   How to Make a Projector for Your Smartphone  
 
- Use the glue to reinforce the flaps of the box. You'll be cutting a large hole at one end so use plenty of glue. Press and hold if necessary on each flap to ensure the glue cures properly. Leave the glue to dry.
 - Photo boxes, like the ones sold in craft stores, are more durable and will allow you to skip this step in many cases.
 - Place the magnifier against one end of the box and sketch a complete circle around it.
 - Place the lens so there's an equal amount of space on all sides, using the measuring tape to confirm.
 - Carefully cut the circle out with the utility blade, then place the lid on the box and use your cut-out to measure how much you need to remove from the lid by holding it over the hole and tracing around the edge.
 - Alternately, just cut the panel of the box off, leaving a little extra.
 - Use glue to securely seat the lens in the hole you've cut by placing the box upright with the hole facing down, and carefully running glue around the edge.
 - After the glue dries, trim away any excess.
 - Shine the flashlight around the edge looking for "light leaks," places where the light shines through. Cover these with the tape.
 - While the glue on the lens dries, build the brace for your smartphone or tablet. This will be a simple inverted T-shape made out of the foamcore or stiff cardboard.
 - Measure the width and depth of the box and cut a piece of foam-core 1/8 of an inch smaller than the width of the box on each side.
 - Cut another piece of foamcore that will fit inside the box vertically and glue it to create a right angle with the base, facing the lens. If you're concerned about stability, use multiple pieces of foamcore to offer a stiffer resistance.
 - Use the tape to secure your smartphone roughly in the middle of the vertical panel to make sure that it sticks with the screen facing out.
 - Now that the glue is dry, you're ready to watch. Place your box with the lens facing your projecting surface and dim the lights.
 - Turn off screen rotation on your phone and turn the brightness and volume all the way up.
 - Cast the audio to a Bluetooth speaker for better sound.
 - Start the media you want to watch, then pause it.
 - Turn your phone so the image is upside down, and tape it to the brace. Place the brace and phone in the box and move it back and forth until the image on the wall is as sharp as possible.
 - Hit play, put the lid on the box, and enjoy!
