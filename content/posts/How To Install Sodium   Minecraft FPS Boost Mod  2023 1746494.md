To install the mod, simply copy the ".jar" file you downloaded in step 2 into the "mods" folder in your Minecraft installation directory. You can find this folder by going to the "mod" section in the new profile you created in step 1 and selecting "Open Game Dir". Once you've located the "mods" folder, simply paste the "sodium-fabric.jar" file you downloaded into this folder.

Step 4: Run Minecraft with Sodium FPS Boost Mod
Now, simply select the new profile you created in step 1 from the Minecraft launcher and click "Play". Minecraft will now launch with the sodium-fabric mod, and you should immediately notice a significant improvement in your game's performance.
