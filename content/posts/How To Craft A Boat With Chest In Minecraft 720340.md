### Introduction:
In games like Minecraft, players can let their creativity run wild by building all sorts of structures. One of the most fascinating things players can build in Minecraft is a chest boat. These boats have chests attached to them that can hold a lot of cargo.

If you've ever wondered how these boats were made, keep reading. In this article, we'll explain, step-by-step, how to create a chest boat in Minecraft.

### Step 1: Collect the Materials
To construct the chest boat, you'll need six wooden planks, two chests, one wooden shovel, and one wooden stick. You can gather these materials by obtaining wood from trees.

### Step 2: Craft the Oars
The first thing you need to do is to make your oars. You can craft these by placing two wooden planks and one wooden stick in a horizontal row in the crafting table, with the stick in the middle. This will give you two oars, one for each side of the boat.

### Step 3: Create the Chests
After crafting the oars, your next step is to create the chests. You can do this by arranging eight wooden planks in the crafting table, with the spaces filled with wooden planks in the shape of a square. This will yield one chest.

Repeat the process, and you'll have two chests.

### Step 4: Build the Boat
Now that you have your oars and chests, you can start building your chest boat. Start by placing a chest on the ground and then placing another chest on top of it.

After positioning the chests correctly, take your wooden shovel and use it to make a small hole in the water. This will serve as the location for the boat's hull.

Assemble your wooden planks into a U-shape around the hole. Then, place the oars in the appropriate slots to support the boat.

### Step 5: Add the Chests to the Boat
Finally, you can add the two chests you built to the boat. To do this, right-click on the chest in your inventory while standing on the boat. You'll be prompted to choose which side of the boat you want the chest to be on.

Congratulations! You have now built your very own chest boat in Minecraft.

### Conclusion:
Building a chest boat may seem complicated at first, but it's an enjoyable project that can be completed in just a few steps. With this guide, you'll be able to create a functional chest boat and enjoy transporting items in style. Have fun!
