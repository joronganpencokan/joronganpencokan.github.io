# You Won't Believe How Much Data This Tiny Microsd Card Can Hold - Up to 400Gb!

The digital age has enabled us to store more data than ever before. From photos and music to important documents, we rely on our storage devices to keep our valuable information safe and accessible at all times. And while hard drives and solid-state drives have made significant strides in storage capacity, there's one device that truly stands out- the MicroSD card.

A MicroSD card is a tiny storage device that can store up to 16 GB, 32 GB, 64 GB, 128 GB, 256 GB, and even up to 400 GB, making it one of the most versatile storage devices out there. Its small size and weight make it the perfect choice for those who want to store data on the go, making it ideal for smartphones, tablets, cameras, and other portable devices.

As technology continues to advance, so does the size and capacity of MicroSD cards. There are currently 400 GB MicroSD cards available, and they come with a host of benefits.

Firstly, the 400 GB MicroSD card provides you with more than enough storage for all your needs. With this MicroSD card, you can store up to 100,000 photos, 70 hours of 4k UHD video, or 200,000 songs. It's perfect for those who have a large media library, as well as for those who need to store large files.

Secondly, this MicroSD card is efficient in dealing with data. With transfer speeds of up to 100 MB/second, this MicroSD card makes it easy to transfer large files between devices. And with UHS Speed Class 3 (U3) and Video Speed Class 30 (V30) ratings, it's perfect for capturing high-quality video and photography.

Thirdly, this MicroSD card is incredibly durable. With built-in shockproof technology, it can withstand extreme temperatures, water, and shock resistance, ensuring that your data remains safe and secure at all times.

But, how does a 400 GB MicroSD card compare to other storage devices in terms of pricing? Surprisingly, it's quite affordable. While the price may vary based on the brand and model, MicroSD cards are often cheaper than traditional storage devices, such as hard drives and solid-state drives. In addition, they offer more flexibility in terms of storage space, allowing you to add or remove data as you please.

In conclusion, the 400 GB MicroSD card is a game-changer in the world of technology. With its incredible storage capacity, efficiency, and durability, it's no wonder it's becoming increasingly popular among consumers. Whether you're a professional photographer, videographer, or just someone who needs to store a lot of data, the 400 GB MicroSD card has got you covered. So go ahead, take the leap and see just how much data this tiny MicroSD card can hold. You won't be disappointed!

On 31 August 2017 SanDisk announced a massive storage capacity microSD card, capable of fitting 400 GB of data onto it. That’s right! A memory card the size of a penny can cram an incredible 40 hours of raw 1080p video, something that was absolutely incomprehensible to technology experts a mere decade ago. But is this really the upper limit? Have we reached peak memory? Or can we fit even more into this tiny 5-square-millimeter space?
 
## A Theoretical Problem
 

 
A half a centimeter doesn’t give you a whole lot of space, and devices that are manufactured for microSD cards cannot be repurposed to fit something else. This means that you’ll have to work within these constraints. Usually, card manufacturers like SanDisk would shrink the size of their transistors so more of them fit into the tiny space. In 2013 this size was roughly 19 nm. One sheet of these transistors within a half-centimeter space would yield 8 GB of storage space, which was plentiful for most small-scale consumer devices.
 
To make more memory fit into the same amount of space, you would need to stack the transistors on top of each other, creating transistor layers that would double or quadruple the amount of storage space available to you. That is how microSD cards with 32 GB capacities began to appear. There comes a point in time, though, where things get a little too cozy and you have to start eating at the frame to fit more layers.
 
At the 19 nm level, you would need eight layers of transistors to fit 64 GB of memory. To fit 400 GB, you’d need exactly fifty layers. While this is theoretically possible, it’s extraordinarily difficult to do in such a confined space.
 
## When There’s No Choice But to Double Down
 
We already discussed the fact that it’s just not feasible to change the dimensions of every slot on every device to fit a bigger card. The only option left is to dive even deeper into microtransistor manufacturing technology. We have to make them smaller!
 
Theoretically, a transistor could be as small as a single molecule. On the 14th of August, we’ve actually managed to make single-molecule transistors that operated sustainably at room temperature. Because the process of making these is so convoluted, we can’t expect them to go mainstream anytime soon, but it presents a window into what the future looks like. We may soon see transistors measuring as little as 5 nm.
 
Remember, transistors fit in a three-dimensional space, meaning that as you make them smaller, you also get more space to stack them. This is what must have happened for SanDisk to be capable of creating a 400 GB microSD card. Under the 10nm transistor specification available to manufacturers as of 2017, you can fit 400 GB of memory using 25 layers of transistors that can now fit roughly 16 GB per layer.
 
With 5nm transistors, we could end up creating microSD cards that fit a terabyte of memory, which is roughly where I see the limit. We might not be able to surpass that level and probably won’t even need to for the foreseeable future.
 
Do you see any need for more than 1 TB of memory (let alone 400 GB) in a microSD format? Tell us your thoughts in a comment!
