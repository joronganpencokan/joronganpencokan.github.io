Unlock iPhone Mail's Secret Formatting Trick for Perfectly Indented Text & Quote Levels!

If you're a frequent iPhone user, odds are pretty high that you're also an avid user of the built-in Mail app. It's a quick, easy way to check your email on-the-go, and it comes pre-installed on all iOS devices. However, like many email clients, there are some hidden formatting options that can improve your emailing experience. In this article, we'll teach you how to unlock Mail's secret formatting trick for perfectly indented text and quote levels.

Step 1: Open the Mail app

First things first, make sure you've opened the Mail app on your iPhone. Once you've launched the app, create a new email by tapping on the compose icon in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.

Step 2: Type your text and quotes

To use Mail's secret formatting trick, you'll need to type out a few lines of text (or copy-paste some) that you want to indent or format as a quote. For example, you might start your email with a brief introduction, followed by a block of text that you want to format as a quote. Here's a quick example:

Hi there,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation regarding the new project. As we discussed, the timeline is tight, but I'm confident we can get things done on time.

"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts." - Winston S. Churchill

Step 3: Select your text

Once you have your text and quotes typed out, you'll need to select the appropriate sections. To do this, simply tap and hold your finger on the first word of the text or quote, and then drag your finger to the end of the selection. You can also tap the screen once to select the nearest word, and then drag the blue selection handles until you've highlighted the desired text.

Step 4: Use the indent and quote buttons

Now that you've selected your text or quote, you can use the hidden formatting trick to indent or format it accordingly. To do this, simply tap the right-facing arrow button in the pop-up menu that appears above your selected text. This will bring up a new set of formatting options, including the ability to indent your text or format it as a quote.

If you want to indent your text, simply tap on the "Increase Indent Level" button. This will move your selected text to the right, creating more space between the left margin and the start of the text. If you want to format your text as a quote, tap on the "Quote Level" button instead. This will add a vertical line to the left margin of your selected text, indicating that it's a quote.

Step 5: Repeat as necessary

Continue selecting and formatting your text or quotes as desired, using the indent and quote buttons as needed. You can also mix and match the two formats, using quotes for some sections and indents for others. And if you ever want to return to the default formatting, simply select the text again and tap the "Clear All Formatting" button in the pop-up menu.

Final Words

With Mail's secret formatting trick, you can easily add more hierarchy and organization to your emails. Whether you're using indents to create a bullet-point list or quotes to emphasize important points, this feature is a great way to make your emails look more professional and polished. So give it a try and see how it can improve your emailing experience!

- Open the email you plan to forward and tap the arrow at the bottom of the screen.
 - Select Forward in the menu that appears.
 - Add the recipient's email address and type a message to explain the forward, if desired.
