# Top Secret Mac Hack: Create A Blank Disk Image In Seconds And Never Worry About Losing Your Data Again!

If you're a Mac user, you probably know that disk images are a great way to keep your important files and data safe. However, creating a blank disk image can be a time-consuming task, and it's something you might not even think about until it's too late. But fear not, there's a top secret Mac hack that can help: creating a blank disk image in seconds.

In this article, we'll walk you through the steps you need to take to create a blank disk image on your Mac in no time. Whether you're a seasoned Mac user or a newbie, you'll find this hack incredibly useful.

# Step 1: Open Disk Utility

The first thing you need to do is open Disk Utility, which is a built-in Mac app that helps you manage your disks, drives, and volumes. You can find it by using Spotlight, the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner of your Mac's screen, or by going to Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility.

# Step 2: Click on 'File' and select 'New Blank Image'

Once Disk Utility is open, click on File in the top left corner of the screen and select New Blank Image from the drop-down menu.

# Step 3: Name Your Disk Image and Choose a Location

You'll now see a window that allows you to name your disk image and select a location where it will be saved. Choose a name that makes sense to you, and select a location where you know you'll be able to find it later.

# Step 4: Select the Size and Format of Your Disk Image

Next, you'll need to select the size and format of your disk image. The size will depend on how much data you want to save, but we recommend choosing a size that's larger than you think you'll need.

As for the format, there are a few options to choose from, including:

- Mac OS Extended (Journaled)
- Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled)
- MS-DOS (FAT)
- ExFAT

For most users, Mac OS Extended (Journaled) is the best option, but if you have a specific reason for choosing another format, go ahead and select it.

# Step 5: Create Your Blank Disk Image

Once you've filled in all the necessary information, click on Create to create your blank disk image. And just like that, you've created a safe space to store your important files and data.

# Step 6: Mount and Use Your Disk Image

To use your blank disk image, all you need to do is double-click on the file to mount it. It will then appear in the Finder, just like any other folder on your Mac.

From there, you can simply drag and drop files into your disk image to save them. And the best part is, your data will be safe and sound, even if your Mac crashes or you accidentally delete a file.

# Final Thoughts

Creating a blank disk image might not seem like a big deal, but it can save you a lot of time and headaches in the long run. And now that you know this top secret Mac hack, you can rest easy knowing that your important files and data are safe and sound.

So next time you're feeling anxious about losing your data, just remember this hack and create a blank disk image in seconds. Your future self will thank you.

A disk image is a container you can place your files and folders in. You can store whatever files you want in a disk image, and you can encrypt the disk image to prevent unauthorized access to your files or even burn the disk image to a CD/DVD.
 
In Mac OS X when you double-click a disk image, instead of launching like an app, it gets mounted as a volume on your machine and can be accessed as if you were accessing an external hard drive. That feature distinguishes it from the other file types.
 
If you wish to create a disk image for your file storage, you may want to create a blank one. Creating a blank disk image is an effortless process on a Mac, and the following guide should help you create one.
 
## Creating a Blank Disk Image
 
In order to create a disk image, you only need access to the “Disk Utility” on your Mac.
 
1. Click on Launchpad in your dock. Search for and click “Disk Utility.”
 

 
2. When the utility launches, click on the “File” menu followed by “New Image” and then select “Blank Image…”
 
3. A dialog box should appear asking you to input the details for your disk image. Input the following information:
 
Save As – Enter a name for the disk image. It can be any name of your choice.
 
Tags – Assign tags to the disk image, if you wish. It is completely optional though.
 
Where – Specify a location where you wish to save the disk image.
 
Name – Enter a name that will appear in the Finder when the disk image is mounted. Again, it can be a name of your choice.
 
Size – Specify the size of the disk image. Make sure you enter a value followed by the unit (200 is incorrect; 200 MB is correct).
 
Format – Enter the disk image file format. If you are going to be using the disk image on a Windows computer, select either MS-DOS (FAT) or ExFAT. The other two formats will not work with Windows. For a Mac, just select any format, and it will work.
 
Encryption – Specify an encryption type here if you would like your disk content to be encrypted. Select “none” if you do not want your files to be encrypted.
 
Partitions – Select a partition type here. If you are not sure, select the “No partition map” option.
 
Image Format – This allows you to select the format of your disk image. For a blank disk image that will be used to store files, the “read/write disk image” should be a good one.
 
Once you have entered all the details, click on the “Save” button.
 
4. Your Mac should take a few seconds to create the image. Once the image has been created, you will see the following message and need to click on “Done” to move forward.
 
5. Your disk image has been created and is mounted on your Mac for you to copy files to it. You can just drag and drop your files onto the disk image, and they will be added.
 
Once you are done adding files, you can eject the image by clicking on the eject icon next to the image name in the Finder. When needed, you can re-open the image by double-clicking on it.
 
## Conclusion
 
If you would like to create a disk image on your Mac to store your files, the above guide helps you create a blank one that can then be read and written to for you to add and delete files.
