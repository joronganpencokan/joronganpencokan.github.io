Revolutionize Your Scanning Game With These Mind-Blowing Tips for Documents and Photos on Your PC or Smartphone!

Gone are the days when scanning was a tedious task that required specialized equipment and extensive training. Today, anyone with a smartphone or a computer can transform documents and photos into digital files in seconds, with just a few clicks. But are you making the most of your scanning capabilities? In this article, we'll share some mind-blowing tips to revolutionize your scanning game and boost your productivity.

Tip #1: Choose the right scanning app

Whether you're using a PC or a smartphone, there are plenty of scanning apps available in the market. However, not all apps are created equal. Some are free, while others come with a premium price tag. Some are simple and user-friendly, while others offer advanced features for professionals. Before you start scanning, it's important to do your research and choose the app that best fits your needs and budget. A few popular scanning apps for smartphones include Adobe Scan, CamScanner, and Microsoft Office Lens. For PC users, Windows Scan, VueScan, and PaperScan are great options.

Tip #2: Use the right settings

When scanning a document or a photo, it's essential to use the right settings to ensure that the quality and resolution are optimal. Depending on the app and device you're using, you may have a variety of settings to choose from, such as color mode, resolution, and file format. For documents, black and white mode is usually the best option, as it produces smaller files and is easier to read. For photos, color mode is preferred, as it captures the full range of colors and details. Higher resolution settings are also recommended for better clarity, but keep in mind that they may result in larger file sizes.

Tip #3: Crop and enhance your scans

Once you've scanned your document or photo, it's time to edit and enhance it for optimal results. Many scanning apps come with built-in editing tools that allow you to crop, rotate, adjust brightness and contrast, and even remove background noise or wrinkles. By taking a few extra seconds to tweak your scans, you can make them more readable, professional-looking, and shareable. Don't forget to save your edits and choose the appropriate file name and location.

Tip #4: Organize your scans

Now that you've scanned and edited your documents and photos, it's important to keep them organized and accessible for future reference. One way to do this is by creating folders or categories that reflect the content or purpose of your scans. For example, you can have separate folders for invoices, contracts, resumes, and personal photos. You can also use tags, keywords, or metadata to make your scans searchable and easy to find. If you're using a cloud storage service like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive, you can upload your scans and access them from any device or location.

Tip #5: Share and collaborate with ease

One of the greatest benefits of digital scans is the ability to share and collaborate with others in real-time, regardless of distance or time zone. By using the sharing and collaboration features of your scanning app or cloud storage service, you can send your scans to colleagues, clients, or family members with just a few clicks, and receive feedback or approvals instantly. You can also set permissions or restrictions to ensure that your scans are secure and confidential.

In conclusion, scanning is no longer a boring or cumbersome task, but a powerful tool for productivity, creativity, and connectivity. By following these mind-blowing tips, you can revolutionize your scanning game and take your digital game to the next level. Happy scanning!

Many would think, who needs to scan stuff in this digital age? But, in reality, there are many circumstances in which is paper is still used as default. For example, bank receipts, government documents, etc., were still handled with papers.
So, at times, you might need to scan documents using a scanner on your Windows computer. Digital printers have the scanner function that allows us to digitize any document quickly and easily, and to do so, the first thing that we have to do is connect the PC to the Scanner or printer through the cable that we will have for it.

 
## Scan Documents & Photos On Computer


After that, the second thing is that each printer or Scanner has a disk that contains the necessary software to manage its functions, so we will have to proceed with its installation on the computer.
Once we do the above things, we can now launch the tool, select the scan function, and then put the document or photos we want to scan in the Scanner or printer.
On each session, we will be able to scan one of the document sheets, but if it is composed of several sheets, then simply all we have to do is repeat this same process for each of the document sheets.
From the software itself, we can indicate the path where we want to save our scanned document, as well as its format, while usually, the default format that we can find is PDF or image format like JPG.
In this way, we can send them, and anyone can open them easily without the help of any specific tool.

Moreover, if you are a Windows 10 user, let me tell you, Microsoft itself offers an application, Scanner, with which we can scan documents and photos on our PC without the help of any other third-party app or software.
While if we do not have the Windows 10 Scanner application installed on the system, we can obtain it from the Microsoft Store, which is available entirely for free.
And not only that, even the application is so simple to use that it hardly has any options to configure. Moreover, it also allows us to choose between several file formats to export our scanned documents.

 
## Scan documents and photos using a smartphone


However, if we do not have a scanner or printer with this function, we can quickly scan a document or photo using our smartphone. This way, we will have a document, invoice, photo, or anything else in digital format in just a few moments.
The first thing that we have to do is open the Google Drive app on our smartphones.

Then simply, we have to touch on the icon of the “+” present in the lower right part of the screen, and then we have to select the “Scan” option. Now we will see the smartphone’s camera application will open, and then it will simply focus on the document, invoice, or photo that we want to scan to capture.

After the above step, click on the “tick button” that appears in the down right corner to confirm the photo. Then it will simply offer the possibility of making several adjustments to the document.
In this case, we will be able to rotate the page, change the name, improve the image, the size of the paper, the orientation, quality of the image, and even delete it.

After the above step, choose the Google account where you want to store it in Google Drive, and then it will automatically save the document.
In just a few moments, we will have the document or photo in digital form and ready to send or share it with whoever we want.

That’s it now you are done. This is how you can scan a document using your smartphone.
