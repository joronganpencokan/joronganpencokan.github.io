The Edit menus offer a variety of choices. You can use either menu to find three key options:

 
- Size & Rotation: Where you can adjust the width and height of the signature or lock its aspect ratio.Text Wrapping: Which can place the signature inline, wrap text around it or place it on its own line.Position: Which lets you fix the location of the signature, move it with the text or select from custom options.

It's a bit tricky to move the signature box around but it's not impossible. The easiest way is to drag and drop it where you want: Hover the mouse over the signature; when you see the cursor change to a four-sided arrow just drag and drop the signature where you want it.

 

You can also try these quick moves:

 
- Place your cursor to the left of the signature box and use the tab key on your keyboard to move it to the right.Place your cursor on the line just above the signature box and press Enter on your keyboard to space the box downward.

 
If you place your cursor to the right of the signature box and press the Backspace key, your signature is removed from the document.
