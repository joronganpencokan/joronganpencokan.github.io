title: You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Move Your Programs To A New Drive In Windows 10 - Here's How!

If you're running low on storage space on your Windows 10 computer, you might be considering moving some of your programs to another drive to free up space. Thankfully, this task is not as complicated as you might think, and can be completed in just a few simple steps using the built-in Windows tools. 

Step 1: Create a backup of your important files

Before you start moving your programs, it's important to create a backup of your important files such as documents, pictures, videos, and music. This will ensure that you don't lose any data during the process. You can backup your files to an external hard drive or a cloud storage service like Google Drive or OneDrive.

Step 2: Identify the programs you want to move

Next, you'll need to identify the programs you want to move. You can do this by opening the Settings app, then clicking on the "Apps" section. Here, you'll see a list of all the apps and programs installed on your computer. 

Step 3: Create a new folder on the new drive

Once you've identified the apps you want to move, you'll need to create a new folder on the new drive where you will be moving them to. You can do this by opening Windows Explorer and navigating to the new drive, then right-clicking and selecting "New Folder". Name the folder something like "Programs" or "Apps".

Step 4: Move the app to the new folder

Now that you have a new folder on the new drive, it's time to move the apps you identified in step 2 to the new folder. To do this, right-click on the app you want to move and select "Move". Then, select the new folder on the new drive and click "Move" again.

Step 5: Create a symbolic link

After you've moved the app to the new folder, you'll need to create a symbolic link. A symbolic link essentially creates a shortcut that points to the new location of the app, so that Windows won't get confused when trying to find and launch the app. 

To create a symbolic link, open the Command Prompt by typing "cmd" in the search bar and right-clicking on "Command Prompt" and selecting "Run as administrator". Then, type the following command:

mklink /J "C:\Program Files\AppName" "D:\Folder\AppName"

Replace "AppName" with the name of the program you moved, "C:\" with the original location of the app, and "D:\" with the new location of the app.

Repeat this process for every program you moved to the new drive.

And that's it! You're all set. Your programs will now be running from the new drive, freeing up valuable storage space on your original drive. Remember to create a backup of your files before you begin, and always be cautious when moving important files or programs around. 

Now that you know how easy it is to move your programs to a new drive in Windows 10, you can start freeing up space on your computer and optimizing your storage. Happy organizing!

When we install any application, software, or program on our PC or laptop, by default, it gets installed in the C-drive. Hence, with time, the C-drive starts filling up and the system speed slows down. This also affects the performance of other pre-installed applications, programs, and software. To prevent this, it is recommended to move some applications, software, and programs from the C-drive to any other empty folder or drive to free some space in it.
 
However, sometimes, some of the applications, software, and programs do not function well if moved to another location. Therefore, the best way is to uninstall the program, install it again, and then move it to the desired location. This process is long and not suitable if the application, program, or software is big and important for the user.
 
Therefore, Windows comes with a built-in utility that allows moving the applications, programs, and software from the system drive or C-drive to another location without uninstalling. But this built-in utility works only for the applications or programs which are manually installed and not for the pre-installed applications. This does not mean that you cannot move those pre-installed apps and programs. For them, you just need to put in some extra effort.
 

 
In this article, we will see different methods using which you can move the new as well as pre-installed applications, software, and programs from the C-drive to another drive.
 
## How to Move Installed Programs To Another Drive In Windows 10
 
As discussed above, moving modern apps & programs from the C-drive is easy and it can be done by using the Windows built-in utility. But to move traditional applications and programs, you need to take the help of third-party applications like the Steam Mover or Application Mover. How these applications can be used to move traditional applications and programs is discussed below:
