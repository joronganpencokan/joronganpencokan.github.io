Joseph Staten returns to get Halo Infinite ‘back on Track’ after writing and directing Halo: Reach as well.
 
After directing and writing the first three chapters of the glorious saga of Halo, Joseph Staten has decided to return to work on the Halo franchise and provide his skills for the development of the highly anticipated Halo Infinite, which is scheduled to arrive in 2021 on Xbox One, PC and Xbox Series X.
 
This was communicated by the software house 343 Industries who is working on the new project on the Master Chief saga. In a post published on its official blog (of which we report a small excerpt), the company has announced how Staten will have the role of the product lead.
 
As product lead on Halo Infinite, however, Joseph will be focused on supporting the campaign team’s existing, talented, creative leaders and ensuring they have everything they need to create an awesome Halo game.
 
Staten also wrote and directed the sci-fi title Destiny for Bungie. According to what emerges from the rest of the press release, it would seem that Staten’s role is limited and of a fixed duration, probably aimed at completing the title of Halo Infinite, delayed due to non-compliance with the timing initially set by 343 Industries. The software house has finally made official that Pierre Hintze, head of the editorial team of Halo: The Master Chief Collection, will also join the development team of Halo Infinite.
 
Halo Infinite, announced during the 2018 edition of E3, will be the sixth chapter of the Halo saga and will also offer players a free-to-play multiplayer mode, similar to what happened with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Warzone. This means that even those players who do not want to purchase the full game will be able to play this mode.
