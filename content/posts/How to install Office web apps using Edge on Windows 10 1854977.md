Alongside Office 365 and Office 2019, Microsoft offers a free version of the Office apps (such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, Calendar, People, and OneDrive), but these are web applications, which you can only use with your web browser.
 
However, if you prefer a more classic experience, you can use the Chromium version of Microsoft Edge to install them on Windows 10 as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).

However, it’s up to the developer to implement these functionalities.
