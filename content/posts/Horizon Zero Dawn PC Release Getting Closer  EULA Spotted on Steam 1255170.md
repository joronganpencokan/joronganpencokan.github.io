Gamers Rejoice as Horizon Zero Dawn PC Release Inches Closer - Exclusive Eula Spotted on Steam!

The gaming community was taken aback when Horizon Zero Dawn was announced to be releasing on PC this year. PlayStation exclusives are known for their stay within the Sony console family, but Guerrilla Games did something that will be remembered for years to come. Move forward a few months, and here we are, with the release of Horizon Zero Dawn on PC becoming closer and closer.

The buzz surrounding the PC release of Horizon Zero Dawn began when SteamDB, a well-known Steam database that tracks updates in the games, released news regarding the game's EULA (End-User License Agreement). It is a piece of legal jargon that explains the terms and conditions required for the game to be played, and its presence indicates that the release could be right around the corner.

Horizon Zero Dawn PC release may not have an official release date as of yet, but the appearance of the EULA suggests that we are inching closer to the launch day. For PC gamers, it is an exciting time as we are going to experience one of the most underrated games since its 2017 release: Aloy's journey to uncover the secrets of her world.

The PC version of Horizon Zero Dawn is not simply a port of the PlayStation version. Instead, it will come with several improvements, including ultra-wide monitor support, an unlocked framerate of up to 144 Hz, and enhanced graphics. In addition, the PC release also includes the expansion pack, The Frozen Wilds, and some in-game items that were exclusive to purchasing the game on the PlayStation.

Horizon Zero Dawn's PC release has been well received by the gaming community, with many appreciating the developer's attempt to make the game accessible to a wider audience. Additionally, the exclusivity of PlayStation titles has been a point of contention in the past, with several titles not having a PC release. However, the release of Horizon Zero Dawn PC has changed the game somewhat.

In conclusion, there's not much to be said about Horizon Zero Dawn except that it is a fantastic game that deserves its reputation as one of the best games of the PlayStation 4 era. It's exciting to see how well it translates to the PC, and with the many improvements and additions made to the game, there's no doubt that it will attract a whole new audience. Gamers can't wait to see Aloy's adventure on the vast horizon that awaits her, and the belief is that it will be a ride to remember.


It looks like soon more players will get acquainted with the first adventure of Aloy. The creators of Horizon Zero Dawn have released an important update on Steam, which always appears before the premiere of the production. So, according to all these updates on the Valve platform, it seems to be confirmed that the game will release on PC in the next couple of days/weeks.
 
After months of rumors and leaks, in March 2020, the action-adventure title of Aloy was officially announced for the PC platform. Sony has not yet confirmed the release date, but the details of the game should come in the next few days.
 
Players have noticed an important message, the developers have released the update of Horizon Zero Dawn on Steam and added EULA (user agreement) on the Valve platform. This always happens before the date is disclosed and the premiere itself.
 
Sony may already, at the beginning of next week, announce the final details of the game on the PC and after a few days, the game will release – it will probably be after the end of Steam Summer Sale (July 9).

An important move was also made by NVIDIA, which in the latest GeForce Experience 3.20.4 update mentioned 39 new games offering NVIDIA Freestyle and NVIDIA Ansel, and as you may have guessed, Horizon Zero Dawn was also on the list.
 
Earlier, the AMD offering also leaked that players will receive Horizon Zero Dawn for free when purchasing selected processors.
 
Recall that Horizon Zero Dawn came to PS4 as an exclusive for a limited time. The game will soon be released on the PC platform as well.
