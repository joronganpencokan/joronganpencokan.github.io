Fortnite players rejoice: Skill Based Matchmaking finally back in Squads mode, level up guaranteed!

Fortnite fans had been eagerly awaiting the return of Skill Based Matchmaking (SBMM) in Squad mode, and now the wait is finally over! Epic Games recently released a statement announcing the re-introduction of SBMM into Squad mode, which has generated a lot of buzz and excitement within the community.

For those who may not be familiar with it, SBMM is a matchmaking system that pairs players based on their skill levels, rather than just randomly grouping them together. This makes playing against opponents with similar skill sets more likely, resulting in a more competitive, enjoyable gaming experience for everyone involved.

The decision to bring SBMM back to Squad mode comes after many complaints from players about the difficulty level in the game after recent updates, making it challenging for players to progress or level up. With the reintroduction of SBMM, players of all skill levels can confidently jump into the game without fear of being matched up against much higher-skilled opponents.

This also opens up opportunities for newer players, allowing them to hone their skills and gradually work their way up to playing with more skilled players, rather than getting destroyed in their matches and giving up.

The return of SBMM to Squad mode has been met with an overwhelming positive response from the Fortnite community, with many players stating that the game is more enjoyable now that they can play with opponents of similar skill sets. For avid fans of the game, this means more fierce opponents to battle with and more rewards to earn.

In conclusion, the re-introduction of Skill Based Matchmaking in Fortnite's Squad mode is a significant win for players of all skill levels. Not only does it guarantee more enjoyable and competitive matches, but it also makes progression and leveling up in the game more accessible for all players. So, grab your controller or keyboard, queue up for Squad mode, and get ready for an exciting, challenging, and rewarding experience!

The absence of skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) in Fortnite squads mode was for a rather short period – from May 5 to May 12. This news was confirmed by a popular data miner, FNBRLeaks after he spotted a scarcity of bots in the game. Fortnite’s developer, Epic Games had discontinued SBMM for a brief period of time to optimize their servers and making a few tweaks in the game. Shortly after, it received a lot of backlash from the gamers because of being too AI dominating. This had drained away all the fun elements from the gameplay.

### Why was SBMM taken down?
 
Fortnite, having millions of daily gamers, has amassed a huge community of professional players until now. Popular Fortnite joes like SypherPK and Tfue were very sound about their disregard for SBMM in the squad mode. It is also rumored that they were the main reason for Epic’s decision of eliminating SBMM from Fortnite.
 
After its removal, the pro-gamers were madly criticized for their views which led to Fortnite losing its jolly-old charm. The game lobbies would be filled with 70-90 bots at a time due to random match-making. This made the game unfair for casual gamers and beginners who were solely in this for having some fun.
 
### Feedback from the gamers
 
Early on in the game, users wanted the involvement of AI to enjoy casual gaming over the more competitive gameplay of Fortnite. So Epic Games decided to give it a shot and much to their dismay, it turned out to be a bad idea. This two-way thinking of the gamers had put Fortnite in a state of limbo until the developers decided to undo the change and get everything back to normal.
 
Now gamers are confused, whether SBMM has truly returned to Fortnite or not. On one hand, data miners statistically claim to it being back, while popular leak sources for Fortnite like Hypex shun this news. And in all this hubbub, there has been no official statement from Epic Games themselves. But since Epic games are widely reputed for having a gamer-friendly attitude, we might be soon hearing from them.
 
Apart from this, Epic games unveiled the first glimpse of its Unreal Engine 5 which is going to hit the developer market with a storm. Here’s Why Unreal Engine 5 Will Push The Boundaries Of Gaming.
