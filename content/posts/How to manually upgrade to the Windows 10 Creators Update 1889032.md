The Windows 10 Creators Update officially launched on April 11, but if your PC still didn’t get the new version, it’s possible to upgrade manually. Although Microsoft recommends to use Windows Update to install the Creators Update, there is a number of ways to get it, including using the Media Creation Tool to do an in-place upgrade of the OS.
 
Using the Media Creation Tool to upgrade to the Windows 10 Creators Update is the same as using Windows Update or the Update Assistant. During this process, you will install the new version of Windows 10, and you’ll be able to keep your personal files, settings, and apps.
 
Typically, you want to upgrade manually when your PC is having problems using Windows Update. For example, when the update gets stuck downloading, the installation fails and rolls back to the previous version, or your device is not seeing the update automatically.
 
While the steps to upgrade to a new version of Windows 10 hasn’t changed significantly, on the Creators Update, Microsoft introduces a new out-of-box-experience (OOBE) featuring Cortana to help anyone regardless of their technical level to quickly complete the setup process.
 
This hands-on video walks you through step-by-step to successfully upgrade to the Windows 10 Creators Update.
