Uncover the Secret to Making Your Android Pass Safetynet with This Edxposed Hack!

Android has become one of the most popular operating systems in the world, with millions of users relying on it for their daily activities. However, it is not always easy to use certain apps that require SafetyNet to operate. SafetyNet is a Google service that detects modifications to your device, and if it detects that your device has been modified, it will prevent you from using certain apps, including banking apps, payment gateways, and more.

Many Android users modify their devices to enhance their performance or to add new features that are not available in the stock version of Android. Unfortunately, these modifications can cause SafetyNet to fail and prevent certain apps from working. However, fear not, because there is a way to make your Android device pass SafetyNet with ease!

The solution is EdXposed, an Xposed module that allows you to bypass SafetyNet on your Android device. EdXposed is a powerful tool that allows you to install modules that modify the behavior of your Android device. With EdXposed, you can install modules that add features or modify existing ones. However, the primary use of EdXposed is to bypass SafetyNet and make your device fully functional again.

To start, you’ll need to have a rooted Android device. If you don't already have a rooted device, you'll need to research how to root your specific device model. Once you have rooted your device, you'll need to install the EdXposed framework. You can download EdXposed from the official GitHub page of the creator, rovo89. After installation, enable EdXposed as a module in the Magisk Manager app.

Next, install modules that are compatible with EdXposed to bypass SafetyNet. Some popular modules that work well include MagiskHidePropsConf, Taichi, Snorlax, and more. These modules work by modifying your device's system properties, allowing it to pass SafetyNet.

After installing the compatible modules, you can check to verify if your device passes SafetyNet. You can use the SafetyNet Helper app to check your device's SafetyNet status. If it says "Device is secure," then you've successfully bypassed SafetyNet, and you can start using apps that require SafetyNet without any restrictions.

It is essential to be cautious when using EdXposed and bypassing SafetyNet. Some apps have explicit measures in place to detect if SafetyNet has been bypassed, and they may block the app from working. Therefore, you must understand the risks before completely relying on EdXposed to bypass SafetyNet.

In conclusion, EdXposed is a powerful tool that can help make your Android device bypass SafetyNet, allowing you to use apps without any restrictions. However, it is essential to understand the risks involved when using EdXposed and bypassing SafetyNet. If you follow the tips mentioned above and exercise caution, you’ll be able to enjoy a fully functional Android device without any restrictions in no time!

Google SafetyNet is an API that checks whether or not a device is alright and in a good state. When the SafetyNet is tripped, you won’t be able to use most of the financial apps such as Google Pay and you will also now be able to play some games that include Pokémon Go and Mario Kart Tour. Installing EdXposed might have triggered SafetyNet, so this guide is a fix to that. Here’s how to make Android pass SafetyNet with EdXposed installed.
 
## Make Android pass SafetyNet with EdXposed installed
 
This tutorial is for those who tried to fix the passing issue by uninstalling EdXposed. Follow the steps below.
 
### Step 1: Blacklist / Whitelist Option
 
This option needs to be enabled inside the EdXposed Installer app before you can get the EdXposed to pass SafetyNet. It is hidden by default as it is a critical setting and should only be used under certain circumstances.
 

 
Open the EdXposed Installer and then tap on the menu icon located on the left. Select EdXp Settings and find the Black / White list option. Enable the option by tapping on the toggle next to it.
 
### Step 2: Blacklist Google Services
 
Once enabled, tap on the Black / White list section. Here, you need to add 3 Google services to make sure EdXposed does not trip SafetyNet.
 
Search for google play services, google play store and google services framework from the search bar on the top. Tap on the checkbox next to google play services, google play store and google services framework. After all three of the items have been added to the blacklist, reboot your Android.
 
### Step 3: Check SafetyNet Status
 
After the device is booted, open the Magisk Manager app and tap on the arrow beside Tap to start SafetyNet check. On the first try, it will probably fail, but try again and it should pass. It’s better to close the app after the first try and open again it again for the second try.
 
You can use this workaround until EdXposed developers can fix the app’s issue with Google SafetyNet. This is not a permanent fix as it may randomly fail the text at times.
