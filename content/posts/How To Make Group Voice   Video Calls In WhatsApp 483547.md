# Revolutionize Your Chat Game: Master the Art of Group Voice & Video Calls on WhatsApp Now!

In today's digital age, communication has become easier and more convenient than ever before. WhatsApp, one of the world's most popular messaging apps, has become the go-to platform for instant messaging, sharing files, and making voice and video calls. WhatsApp's group calls feature allows you to connect with your friends and family no matter where they are in the world. If you're looking to maximize your experience of WhatsApp group calls, then read on for some expert tips and tricks.

## Get Connected

The first step to mastering the WhatsApp group call feature is to ensure that you have a stable and reliable internet connection. Be aware of your surroundings and eliminate any background noise that may disrupt the call. Additionally, make sure everyone who wants to participate in the group call has the latest version of WhatsApp installed on their device.

## Start a Group Call

Before starting a group call, you need to create a group chat, which consists of two or more people. You can create a group by tapping on the "New Group" icon in the chat section. Once you have created a group, you can start a group call by tapping on the phone icon in the top right corner of the screen. Select the participants you want to include in the call, and you're good to go.

## Embrace Video Calls

WhatsApp's group video call feature is an excellent way to connect with your loved ones. It allows you to see and hear your friends and family in real-time, making it feel as if you're all in the same room. All you need to do is to tap the video camera icon instead of the phone icon on the group chat screen. Ensure that your device's camera is functional, and you have proper lighting and a steady surface to prevent shaky footage.

## Perfect the Audio Quality

The quality of the audio is critical in any group call, and WhatsApp offers several features to ensure that you have the best experience. One such feature is the ability to control the volume of a particular participant in the call. To do this, tap and hold the individual's name, and select "Mute" or "Unmute" as desired. You can also turn on the "Speaker" mode to allow everyone in the room to hear the conversation.

## Share Your Screen

WhatsApp offers a feature that enables you to share your screen during a group call, enabling you to present a document, website, or media item to the group. To activate this feature, tap on the "Share Screen" icon on the call screen. Ensure that your device is compatible with this feature before using it. You can also use the "Chat" feature to send messages to the group during the call, making it a more interactive experience.

## Conclusion

WhatsApp's group call feature enables you to connect with your friends and family instantly, no matter where they are in the world. By following the tips and tricks mentioned in this article, you can revolutionize your chat game and master the art of group voice and video calls on WhatsApp. Remember to stay connected, embrace video calls, perfect the audio quality, share your screen, and most importantly, have fun!

WhatsApp has a feature that allows you to call multiple friends at the same time. 
 
It isis supported for both audio and video calls and from our point, it’s similar to WhatsApp Story to some degree. In this guide, we have mentioned quick steps to let you know how you can make group voice and video calls on WhatsApp.
 
To get started, you need to do the obvious – update WhatsApp to the latest version. After you’ve done that follow the method below.
 
## How To Make Group Calls On WhatsApp
 
I will be using the steps and screenshots from the Android app. But iPhone users won’t notice much of a difference.
 
1. Open WhatsApp and go to the conversation of the friend who is one of the participants.
 
2. Now, tap on the telephone icon to place a voice call or video icon to make a video call. Tap on Call to proceed.
 
3. Once this person picks up your audio or video call, you will see an add person icon at the top right of the screen. Tap on it.
 
4. On the next screen, you will be able to see all your WhatsApp contacts. Select the desired friend you wish to add to the group call from the list or search if required.
 
5. Similarly, you can keep adding other participants. Please remember, add member icon will disappear once there are 4 people in a group call. Also, other participants can also add other members to the group call.
 
This is how you can easily make group calls on WhatsApp for Android and iPhone.
 
One thing I didn’t like is that you have to add the participants one at a time. Currently, there is no option to add multiple people at once. Apart from that, you cannot switch from group voice to group video call which is possible when you are on a voice call with a single contact.
