Revolutionary Update: Google Maps Brings Unprecedented Accessibility To Wheelchair Users!

In a world where navigating city streets can be challenging, imagine how much more daunting it is for someone using a wheelchair. Fortunately, Google Maps has introduced some revolutionary updates that will allow wheelchair users to navigate with much more ease.

As of July 10th, 2017, Google Maps includes a feature that highlights wheelchair accessible entrances and routes to public transit stations in six metropolitan areas across the globe. The integration of wheelchair accessibility information on Google Maps is long overdue, but it is a welcome addition for millions of people globally.

Before the update, information about wheelchair accessibility was limited to the street view of locations. Users had to rely on their own exploration or taking a chance in order to determine whether a certain location is accessible or not. But with this latest update, wheelchair users can now know what they are getting into before they leave their home.

The new Google Maps feature provides users with real-time information regarding not just the accessibility of the location but also the best route to take for a smooth journey. This feature promotes the independence of wheelchair users and makes it possible for them to move around freely without experiencing unnecessary obstacles.

The introduction of wheelchair accessible paths on Google Maps has not only provided convenience for the disabled persons but also sends a clear message to establishments of the importance of prioritizing accessibility. Creating easier access for the disabled community to different locations also helps to boost diversity and inclusivity.

Google Maps isn't the only service to feature wheelchair accessibility information, but it is the most easily accessible one. More services and organizations need to come on board and prioritize the inclusion of the disabled community. In this day and age, there is more changing and information sharing than ever before, and accessibility is not something that should be excluded.

In conclusion, Google Maps' latest update to include wheelchair accessibility information is a huge step towards ensuring the independence and inclusion of people living with disabilities. It is a testament to the power of technology and how it can be leveraged to improve our lives. It's high time other organizations and services take note of the importance of prioritizing accessibility to promote inclusivity, acceptance, and diversity in society.

Google Maps just got a new accessibility feature that raises the prominence of accessibility information. You can now turn on “Accessible Places:” and have little wheelchair icons show up to indicate an accessible entrance, seating, restrooms, or parking. If a place doesn’t have an accessible entrance, that information will show up as well.

 
More than 130 million people across the globe use wheelchairs, and even more have trouble using stairs. Knowing what accessibility features a place has will help all of them navigate the world much more easily.
 

Behind the scenes: May 21, 2020 was Global Accessibility Awareness Day, making this a perfect time to launch the new initiative. In the U.S. alone, one in five people have some sort of disability, according to the 2010 Census, with roughly 31 million Americans using a wheelchair or having difficulty walking and climbing stairs.

 

Google Maps: Google claims it has accessibility info for more than 15 million places around the globe, a number that’s doubled since 2017 due to people submitting local information. The iOS update to Google Maps adds a more easy way to contribute, as well, bringing the feature up to par with the Android version.

 

How to: Make sure your Google Maps app is updated to the latest version, go to your Settings app, tap Accessibility, then turn on Accessible Places. You’ll find it on both iOS and Android app versions.
