Before diving into the details of importing video clips, it's essential to understand the different video file formats supported by Windows Movie Maker. The software supports most of the widely used file formats such as WMV, AVI, MPG, and MP4. However, if you are working with an unsupported file format, you may need to convert the video file before importing it to the editor.

Now, let's look at the ultimate secret to importing video clips like a pro in Windows Movie Maker. One of the biggest mistakes that most beginners make is importing video clips in their original length. This approach can make your editing process time-consuming and frustrating, especially if you are working with large video files.

To import video clips like a pro, you should use the trim tool provided in Windows Movie Maker. The trim tool allows you to select the specific part of the video clip that you want to import. Here is how you can use the trim tool to import video clips in Windows Movie Maker:

Step 1: Open Windows Movie Maker and click on the "Import" button in the toolbar.

Step 2: Navigate to the location where your video clip is saved and select it.

Step 3: Once you have selected the video clip, the trim tools window will appear. Here you can select the specific segment of the video clip that you want to import into Windows Movie Maker by dragging the slider to the desired position.

Step 4: Click on the "Import" button, and Windows Movie Maker will import only the selected part of the video clip.

The trim tool is a powerful feature that can help you save time and make your editing process more efficient. By importing only the parts of your video clip that you need, you can avoid cluttering your timeline with unnecessary footage, making it easier to navigate through your project.

In conclusion, importing video clips is an essential task in video editing, and doing it like a pro can make a significant difference in the result of your projects. Windows Movie Maker provides users with a platform to import, edit, and produce their video projects. The ultimate secret to importing video clips like a pro in Windows Movie Maker is by using the trim tool.

Also be sure to check the box next to Create clips for video files, which is located at the bottom of the Import Files dialog box. Videos are often comprised of many small clips, which are marked by the creating program when the file is saved. These smaller clips are created when the video process is paused or there's a very obvious change in the filming. This is helpful to you, as the video editor, so that the project is broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

 
If you can't find the video file but you're sure it's in an acceptable video format, make sure the Files of type drop-down menu is set to Video Files and not another option like for audio or picture files. If another category of files is selected, you might not be able to see the video you want to import.
