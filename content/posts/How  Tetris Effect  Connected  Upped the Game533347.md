# Unleashing Tetris Effect Connected: The Mind-Blowing Game Upgrade You Never Knew You Needed!

Are you a Tetris fanatic looking for a fresh and immersive gaming experience? Look no further than Tetris Effect Connected. This newly released version of the classic game takes the gameplay to a whole new level, incorporating mind-blowing visuals and social connectivity.

Tetris Effect Connected builds upon the success of its predecessor, Tetris Effect, which was released in 2018 for PlayStation 4 and PC. Developed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi's studio, Enhance, the game was praised for its mesmerizing sights and sounds that blended seamlessly with the gameplay.  The game was an instant hit, earning a nomination for the Game Awards' Best VR/AR Game and winning the BAFTA award for Audio Achievement.

Tetris Effect Connected takes the same winning formula of its predecessor and adds multiplayer functionality, providing players with an all-new social and competitive experience. The game supports both local and online co-op and competitive play, allowing players to team up with friends or engage in one-on-one battles with players worldwide.

One of the most significant features of Tetris Effect Connected is the new Zone Battle mode. In this mode, players can take on opponents in a continuous, fast-paced battle of wits and endurance. With each cleared line, the player gains the ability to "Zone" the opponent, slowing down their Tetriminoes and limiting their ability to clear lines. It's an intense and thrilling mode that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

But the game's appeal goes beyond just its new multiplayer modes. Tetris Effect Connected delivers a sensory experience like no other, with stunning visuals and an immersive soundtrack that reacts to the player's moves. The game features more than 30 stages, each with a unique visual and musical theme that will transport you to different worlds, from the serene beauty of a deep sea dive to the frenzied sounds of an arcade.

Tetris Effect Connected is also available on Xbox Game Pass, making it more accessible to gamers than ever before. This subscription service allows subscribers to access hundreds of games at no extra cost, providing a way for players to try out games they may have never considered before.

Overall, Tetris Effect Connected is an impressive upgrade from the original Tetris Effect game, providing a much more inclusive experience for casual and competitive gamers alike. The game's stunning visuals and immersive soundscapes, combined with its plethora of new multiplayer modes, create an experience that is undeniably addictive. If you're a Tetris fan looking for a fresh take on the classic game, look no further than Tetris Effect Connected.

Tetris Effect: Connected brings the colorful action of Tetris Effect to the Xbox for the first time with new multiplayer features in a simple, explosively fun package.

Key Takeaways
 
- Tetris Effect: Connected is just as colorful and wonderful as the 2018 release.Multiplayer brings an entirely new way to enjoy Tetris Effect’s different modes.Tetris Effect: Connected brings the game to Xbox for the first time, and is available on Game Pass.

 

When the original Tetris Effect hit PCs and PS4 in 2018, it brought a unique spin to the Tetris formula. Beautiful and colorful backgrounds helped bring the base Tetris formula to an entirely new level.

 

The addition of the line attack, which allowed you to attack your opponent by clearing out lines was also a unique way to approach the system. Now, Tetris Effect: Connected brings all those unique mechanics and aesthetics to the Xbox, alongside some wonderful new multiplayer modes like Connected, Zone Battle, and Score Attack.

 

Diving into Tetris Effect: Connected on the Xbox Series S, I was already well aware of what the game had to offer. The vibrant colors and levels, as well as the music itself make for some of the most surreal moments a Tetris game has ever offered. Toss in the added multiplayer features—there are four new modes—and you’ve got a recipe for greatness. A greatness that it absolutely delivers on.

 
##   Connecting With Others  
 

While Zone Battle and the other modes are fun, Connected is what makes Tetris Effect: Connected shine like a full moon on a dark night. Unlike the other multiplayer modes—which are basically versus modes—Connected pits three players against A.I. controlled bosses as they work to take them down.

 

It’s a unique way to approach the Tetris formula and one that really helps show that pizazz that Tetris Effect has always had.

 

In Connected, all three players work to match up their pieces in their own separate blocks. As the score grows, the Matrices (the boxes that the pieces fall down through, sometimes called the Tetris Matrix, too) connect and players enter a special section where they can deal massive amounts of damage to the A.I. boss as they connect and clear lines.

 

It’s a really cool way for things to play out and it felt really good to pull off big combos with the other two people I was playing with during my tests.

 

Tetris Effect: Connected gives players a few different ways to enjoy multiplayer, including some two-player modes like Zone Battle, Score Attack, and Classic Score Attack. Zone Battle is similar in ways to Tetris 99, the Tetris battle royale game on the Nintendo Switch. It’s only one versus one, though, so players can really focus on each other instead of a large group.

 

I had a lot of fun trying to take down other players, but more often than not I found my opponents clearing their lines quicker than I could. Since everything moves so quickly, the addition of the Zone mechani, which slows down time and focuses on certain parts of the Tetris Matrix, was very handy for racking up a higher score. Sadly, it couldn’t save me the embarrassment of losing time after time.

 

Zone Battle was fun, but I found more of my enjoyment for versus modes in Score Attack and Classic Score Attack. These one versus one modes are basically the same, though Classic follows the original Tetris rules, which means you can’t hold onto blocks, and you can’t use the Hard Drop mechanic that so many other Tetris titles have included.

 

Despite being a versus mode, I found it easy to load up Score Attack and start working on lining up my blocks. The lack of features like line attack made it much easier for me to just focus on what I had in front of me without having to worry about the things my opponent could throw at me.

 
##   Galactic Improvements  
 

Tetris Effect: Connected takes everything about the original Tetris Effect and makes it even better. The new multiplayer modes are an absolute joy to play through and Connected showcases just how far the developers have gone to try to make it feel unique.

 

Considering the fact that the Guiness Book of World Records recorded Tetris as the most ported game of all time with over 65 ports in 2010, it’s impressive that Tetris Effect: Connected can feel so unique compared to the other experiences out there.

 

Tetris Effect: Connected brings all of the beauty and joy of the original to the Xbox for the first time and even adds a lot of flare to it in the process. The new multiplayer modes only uplift the game even more, giving fans plenty of new ways to dive in and get lost in the vibrant and colorful world that awaits them.
