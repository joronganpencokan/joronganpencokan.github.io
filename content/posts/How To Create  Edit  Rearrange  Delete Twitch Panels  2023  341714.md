# Unlock the Secret to Stunning Twitch Panels: The Ultimate Guide to 2023 Panel Creation, Editing, Rearranging, and Deletion!

As a Twitch streamer, having engaging panels is vital to ensure the success of your channel. Your Twitch panels provide your viewers with important information about you and your content. Without them, you may lose potential followers who don't understand what your channel is all about. Creating a compelling panel can seem daunting, but with the right information, it can be an enjoyable experience. 

In this ultimate guide, we will reveal the secrets to stunning Twitch panels that will grab your viewers' attention and keep them engaged. We'll cover every aspect of panel creation, including editing, rearranging, and deletion, to help you achieve the perfect look for your channel.

## The Basics of Panel Creation

The first step in creating a Twitch panel is to decide what information you want to communicate to your viewers. You can display information about your stream schedule, social media profiles, donation links, and more. You'll want to consider not only what information is important but also how it is presented. 

To create a panel, log in to your Twitch account and select "Dashboard" from the drop-down menu. This will take you to the Channel Dashboard, where you can manage your panels. From there, select the "Panels" tab and then "Create Panel." 

Once you've created a panel, you'll need to customize it. You can add images, text, and links by selecting the "Edit Panel" button. You can also change the panel's position by dragging and dropping it to a different location on your channel page. This is particularly useful when you want to rearrange your panels for better visibility or to accommodate new information.

## Twitch Panel Editing Tips

Editing your Twitch panels is another important factor to ensure they look stunning. Here are some editing tips to take into consideration:

### Use High-Quality Images

Images form an integral part of your panel. They can help to capture the attention of viewers and convey important information. When uploading images to your panels, make sure they are of high quality and relevant to the information you are sharing. 

### Write Compelling Text

The text you use on your panels should be clear and concise. Use short sentences and bullet points to make important information easily digestible. Be sure to use a font that is easy to read and choose colors that complement your brand. 

### Add Calls to Action

Don't be afraid to add calls to action to your Twitch panels. These can be anything from asking viewers to follow you on social media to encouraging donations. You can use donation links or subscription buttons directly on your panels to make it easy for viewers to support your channel.

### Be Consistent

Consistency is key when it comes to creating stunning Twitch panels. Ensure that all of your panels follow the same design principles, like using the same color schemes and fonts. Consistency will make your channel feel more cohesive and professional. 

## Rearranging and Deleting Panels

There may be times when you need to rearrange or delete your Twitch panels. To delete a panel, simply click on the panel and then select the "Delete" button. To rearrange your panels, select and drag the panel to a new position.

You can also add or remove panel tabs to accommodate more information. This is particularly useful if you have a lot of information to share and want to organize it into distinct categories.

## The Bottom Line

Twitch panels are a fundamental component of any successful channel. They provide viewers with important information and can help to attract new followers. With the tips and tricks outlined in this ultimate guide, you'll be well on your way to creating stunning panels that accurately represent your brand and engage your viewers. 

Remember to be consistent with your panel design and to use high-quality images and compelling text. Add calls to action where necessary and rearrange or delete panels as needed.

You can easily stream on Twitch without any restrictions and start gaining viewers if what you’re offering is worthy. And those same viewers will then start visiting your channel to get to know more about you. So, the question is, what will those viewers see on your channel besides your stream? Will the stream alone be enough to create a good first impression? Well, probably not. You have to make the most out of their visit by giving them something through Twitch panels. Basically, by creating panels, you can provide so much to your viewers, like a direct link to your Instagram or Twitter account. You can even create live polls on Twitch panel. And you can do all that in a decorative and much more appealing way.
 
But the thing is, if you’re just starting out on Twitch, then you probably don’t know how to create Twitch panels. Well, don’t worry because we’re here to help you out with that. In this article, we’ll guide on everything regarding Twitch panels. So, without waiting any further, let’s get started.

## Create Twitch Panels
 
Basically, you can make two types of panels on Twitch:
 
Extensions panel: Extensions are like apps that are used to keep the audience engaged. Like you can activate the Suggestion Box extension, which can be used by the viewers to hit you up with any suggestion. And there are a number of extensions like that. Once you activate the extension panel, you can configure it at your own convenience.
 
Image/text panel: On the other hand, the Image/Text panels are quite basic and are used more often. You can use it if you want to input some images or text in the panel. This type of panel is best used when you want to give a message to the viewers. Also, you can use them to redirect the viewers to someplace like your Instagram account, using a link.
 
So, if you want to create either of the above panels, then follow the steps given below.
 
1. First, open your Twitch channel. To do that, click on your avatar on the top right corner of the screen and then select the ‘Channel’ option.
 
2. Now that you’re on your channel scroll down below your stream screen and you’ll see the ‘Edit Panels’ toggle bar on the extreme left corner. By default, it will be disabled, so all you have to do is enable it.
 
3. Just after you enable it, you’ll see various extension panels that you can activate. And below the extension list, you’ll see a huge + icon to add a panel. Just click on it. (Note: If in the list, you see an extension you want to add, then just click on Activate to open its configuration and then add it.)
 
4. Next, select the type of panel you want to add.
 
Extension Panel
 
- If you select the Extension Panel, then the panel space will be created for an extension. To add an extension to that space, first, click on the ‘Extension Manager’ option.

 
- Next, you’ll see a list of all the installed extensions. And to activate one of those extensions, you have to click on ‘Activate’ and assign them the panel space.

 
(Note: To open the configuration of a particular extension, click on the ‘Settings icon.’ Also, you can delete the installed extensions by clicking on the ‘Delete icon.’)
 
- If there’s an extension you want to use that hasn’t been installed, then you can install it after finding it in the ‘Discovery’ tab.

 
Image/Text Panel
 
- On the other hand, if you want either a text or an image panel, then click on the ‘Add a text or Image panel’ option.

 
- Then, you’ll have to give a Panel Title. After that, you can add an image and provide a link in the ‘Image Links to:’ bar. This link will help to redirect the people when they click on the image. Like if I want people to get to my Instagram account after clicking the image, then I’ll provide the link for the Instagram account and upload an image accordingly. After doing all this, you can provide a description and then click on Submit. Your panel will now be up and going.

 
Note: The image you’re trying to upload should not be more than 1 MB in size. Also, the image will automatically be resized to 320*640 pixels. So, it’s better to rescale the picture to that size before uploading it to maintain its quality.
 
- Finally, to see how your panels are working, you’ll have to turn off the ‘Edit Panels’ toggle bar.

 
## Edite Twitch Panels
 
Now, it may be that you’ve created some of the panels a while back, and now you want to edit those panels for some reason. Well, to do that, you just have to get back to your channel and turn on the Edit Panels toggle bar. Then, all the previously created panels can be edited in the same way they were created.
 
### Rearrange Panels
 
While editing the panels, you may realize that you want to change the position of the panels. Thankfully, doing that is pretty easy. All you have to do is drag the panel and drop it at the position where you want it to be. The panel which was originally in that particular position will automatically move just after the new panel.
 
### Delete Panels
 
If you’re tired of some of your panels and you just want to get rid of them, then you can always remove them. When on the edit panel screen, you’ll see the ‘Remove’ option below each and every panel. Just click on that option and then confirm your decision by again clicking on ‘Remove.’
