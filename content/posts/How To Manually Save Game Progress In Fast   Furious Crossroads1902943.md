Attention all Fast & Furious Crossroads players! Are you tired of losing your game saves and progression every time your computer crashes or you switch devices? Well, have no fear because saving your progress has never been easier! In this article, we will be showing you just how simple it is to save your Fast & Furious Crossroads progress no matter which device you are playing on.

Step 1: Create an account

The first step in saving your Fast & Furious Crossroads progress is to create an account. If you have already created an account, proceed to step 2. If not, simply visit the game’s website or open the game on your device and click the 'Create Account' button. Be sure to provide accurate information and save your login details somewhere safe so that you can easily sign in anytime you want to play.

Step 2: Connect your account to your device

Once you have created an account, you need to connect it to the device that you're using to play. This will make it easier for you to access and save your progress. On the Fast & Furious Crossroads home screen, click on the settings button, and choose the 'Account' tab. Input your login details, and your account will be successfully linked to your device.

Step 3: Save your progress

The final and most crucial step is to save your progress regularly. Fast & Furious Crossroads automatically saves your progress after every level or mission, so you don't have to worry about losing anything. However, to be on the safer side, we recommend saving your progress manually, especially after completing a major mission or earning a new car. To save your progress, navigate to the settings button, and choose the 'Save' option or simply save when prompted at the end of each mission.

Conclusion

In conclusion, saving your Fast & Furious Crossroads progress has never been easier now that you know how to create an account, connect it to your device, and save your progress regularly. No longer will you have to start from scratch every time you switch devices or encounter technological mishaps. All it takes is a few clicks, and you're good to go! Get back to racing and completing missions with ease now that your progress is saved.
