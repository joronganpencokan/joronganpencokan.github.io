Unlock the Secret to Fortifying your Privacy on Your iPhone: Learn How to Lock Apps like a Pro!

Privacy is a fundamental right that must be duly protected for every individual. In this digital age, most people rely on their iPhones for almost everything from making calls, sending texts, accessing social media, browsing the internet, and handling sensitive data. Unfortunately, with the increasing technological advances, hackers are equally becoming more sophisticated in their attacks, leaving users' data vulnerable.

Fortunately, through app locks, you can now fortify your security and protect your information. In this article, we will discuss how to lock apps like a pro and unlock the secret to fortifying your privacy.

What is App Lock?

App lock is a security feature that prevents unauthorized access to apps on your device. It helps you protect your sensitive information from being accessed by anyone who has access to your phone. App lock can also prevent unwanted transactions and ensure that your children or anyone using your phone without your consent does not access restricted content.

App lock is essential for safeguarding your privacy and ensuring that your data remains secure. Here's how to lock apps like a pro:

Step 1: Download an App Locking App.

The first step is to download an app locking app from the App Store. Some of the top app locking apps include App Locker, The Vault, and Norton App Lock. You can choose the app that best suits your needs.

Step 2: Launch the App Locking App

Once you have downloaded and installed the app locking app, launch it from your iPhone apps menu. You will be prompted to create a password, which you will use to access the app locker.

Step 3: Select the Apps you Want to Lock

After setting up the password, select the apps you want to lock. You can choose to lock all apps or select specific apps depending on your preferences.

Step 4: Customize the Settings

Customize the app lock settings to suit your preferences. You can choose between PIN, Password, or Pattern lock, set a time-out period for the lock, and adjust the in-app settings.

Step 5: Save and Exit

After customizing your settings, save the changes and exit the app locking app. You're now ready to use your iPhone while enjoying enhanced privacy.

Conclusion

In conclusion, locking apps is a crucial way of fortifying your privacy on your iPhone. By following the above steps on how to lock apps like a pro, you can protect your sensitive information from unauthorized access, safeguard your online transactions, and prevent unwanted access to restricted content. Remember, always download the best app-locking apps from trusted sources to ensure maximum protection from cyber-attacks.

This article explains how to lock apps on an iPhone up to iOS 14. Information regarding workarounds is also included.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Current iPhones: Go to Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > Allowed Apps. Turn off an app's switch to hide it.On iOS 11 or earlier: Go to Settings > General > Restrictions > Enable Restrictions. In the Allow section, turn off apps to lock them.

 
##   How to Lock First-Party Apps  
 

In iOS 12 through iOS 14, you can lock first-party apps using Screen Time, a feature introduced in iOS 12. A first-party app is an app that Apple creates rather than an app from another software maker.

 
- Open Settings.
 - Go to Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions.
 - Tap Allowed Apps.
 - Turn off the toggle switches (tap them to turn the switch white) for apps you don't want to use.
 - Tap the Back button or swipe up to go to the Home screen.

 
##   How to Lock First-Party Apps in iOS 11 and Earlier  
 

One simple app lock method that works for most iPhones—but only for first-party Apple apps—involves the use of Restrictions. Go to Settings > General and then scroll down and navigate to Restrictions > Enable Restrictions. Once prompted, enter a new passcode (twice to confirm).

 

Open Settings.

 

Go to Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions.

 

Tap Allowed Apps.

 

Turn off the toggle switches (tap them to turn the switch white) for apps you don't want to use.

 

Tap the Back button or swipe up to go to the Home screen.

 

After you enable restrictions and enter a new passcode, you're presented with a variety of options. In the Allow section, you have the option of disallowing a range of first-party apps, such as Safari, Siri, and FaceTime. This doesn't include apps you downloaded. By swiping the green toggle icon to the off position, you can stop any disallowed apps from appearing on your Home screen.

 
##   How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Guided Access  
 

Guided Access is a nuclear app lock option in that it prevents you from leaving the app you're currently using. Still, it could come in handy if your child wants to use a particular app on your phone, but you're worried that they might venture elsewhere.

 

Guided Access requires iOS 11 or newer. Follow these steps to use it:

 
- From Settings, go to General > Accessibility > Guided Access.
 - iOS 13 has this setting under: Setting > Accessibility.
 - Swipe the Guided Access toggle switch to the On/green position.
 - Go to Passcode Settings > Set Guided Access Passcode.
 - Enter a new passcode and then enter it again to confirm.

 

After you enable Guided Access and set your passcode, use the feature by opening any app and pressing the side button three times or the Home button three times, depending on your phone, once the app has started.

 

From Settings, go to General > Accessibility > Guided Access.

 
iOS 13 has this setting under: Setting > Accessibility.
 

Swipe the Guided Access toggle switch to the On/green position.

 

Go to Passcode Settings > Set Guided Access Passcode.

 

Enter a new passcode and then enter it again to confirm.

 

This displays the Guided Access start screen, which lets you draw a circle around the areas of the screen to disable (set it to either cover the entire screen or none of it). Alternatively, choose Options in the lower-right corner of the screen, which can be used to disable everything from the volume buttons to the touch screen, as well as set a time limit on the Guided Access session (up to 24 hours).

 

If you own a Touch ID-enabled iPhone, use Touch ID instead of a passcode to end a Guided Access session.

 
##   How to Use Touch ID to Lock Compatible Apps on iPhone 5S to iPhone 8  
 

With Touch ID, it's possible to lock a limited number of compatible apps using the fingerprint-based security feature (available on the iPhone 5S through the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus).

 

To lock Apple Pay, iTunes, and the App Store in this way, open Settings and go to Touch ID & Passcode to enter your passcode. Then, turn on the toggle switches (to the green/on position) for the apps you wish to lock using Touch ID.

 
This article assumes you are using a passcode to get into your iPhone. If you don't, here's how to turn Passcode on.
 

The above covers only Apple Pay, iTunes, and the App Store, however. Using Touch ID to lock apps you download from the App Store requires a different process, and many popular apps (such as Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat) don't enable this process, meaning that you can't lock these apps individually.

 
If you haven't set up Touch ID, you're prompted to do so when turning on any available option.
 

There's a growing number of apps that offer the option to lock apps using Touch ID, while a smaller number also offer the option to lock apps using a passcode.

 

Generally, doing this requires the following:

 
- Open the Touch ID-compatible app.
 - Go into its settings.
 - Find the option that locks the app with a password or with your fingerprint. It might be in a Privacy or Preferences section and could be called Password, Passcode, Touch ID Lock, Lock, Screen Lock, or anything similar.
 - If needed, follow any on-screen steps to complete the app lock procedure.

 
##   How to Set Time Limits for Apps  
 

You can also set time limits for apps, which is similar to locking apps away from your own use.

 

Open the Touch ID-compatible app.

 

Go into its settings.

 

Find the option that locks the app with a password or with your fingerprint. It might be in a Privacy or Preferences section and could be called Password, Passcode, Touch ID Lock, Lock, Screen Lock, or anything similar.

 

If needed, follow any on-screen steps to complete the app lock procedure.

 
- Go to Settings > Screen Time > App Limits > Add Limit.
 - In the list of apps, make a decision on which to restrict access. Tap the check box button to the left of the app category you want to restrict, for example, Social Networking. You can restrict certain apps inside Social Networking (for example) by tapping through to the category.
 - Choose a time limit for the use of that app category (such as 1 hour). You can also customize the days you want this restriction in place. Tap the Add button to save the settings.

 
##   How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using a Third-Party App  
 

There is one last option if you want to lock apps directly, and it involves using a third-party app.

 

Go to Settings > Screen Time > App Limits > Add Limit.

 

In the list of apps, make a decision on which to restrict access. Tap the check box button to the left of the app category you want to restrict, for example, Social Networking. You can restrict certain apps inside Social Networking (for example) by tapping through to the category.

 

Choose a time limit for the use of that app category (such as 1 hour). You can also customize the days you want this restriction in place. Tap the Add button to save the settings.

 

In one respect, this is the best option for locking apps since there are a number of apps available that, in one way or another, block access to every app on your iPhone using a passcode (or biometric ID). However, it's also the worst app lock option for iPhone. To use these apps, your iPhone must be jailbroken (which may create security vulnerabilities and performance issues; it's not recommended).

 

Some popular examples of third-party apps that lock other apps include BioProtect, Locktopus, and AppLocker. These can be downloaded and installed using the Cydia platform, which is home to apps specifically designed for jailbroken iPhones.

 

In the case of BioProtect, once the app has been downloaded, you can lock specific apps by going to Settings > Applications under the Protected Items section, and then toggling the apps you wish to lock into the green/on position.

 

Something else to consider for your app locking needs is to nix the idea completely. Depending on your needs, a third-party vault app might be all you need to hide things like images and notes, making them accessible only after the correct password has been entered.

 

If you don't necessarily need to lock the whole app (such as Photos), but instead just specific things like private images, documents, or videos, you might have luck with one of those apps.
