Title: You'll Never Believe It - GTA 6 Put on Hold as Rockstar Turns Medieval! Get the Inside Scoop Here!

If you're a fan of Rockstar Games, you probably know that they are the creators behind some of the most popular game franchises, such as Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption. However, the latest news from the Rockstar camp is quite unexpected - they've decided to turn their attention towards medieval times, putting the much-anticipated GTA 6 on hold. Let's delve into the details of this surprising move and the reasons behind it.

The news was first leaked by an anonymous source who claimed to be a former Rockstar employee. According to the source, the studio has been working on a new game set in medieval Europe for a few years now. The game is apparently being developed under the codename "Project Medieval" and is said to be an ambitious undertaking. The game is rumored to feature an open-world map, a robust combat system, and a narrative-driven storyline.

While there hasn't been any official confirmation of the existence of Project Medieval, there are a few factors that lend credibility to the rumors. Firstly, Rockstar has often been praised for its attention to detail and authenticity in its games. This would make them well-suited to creating a game set in medieval times, a period that is notoriously difficult to recreate accurately.

Secondly, the games industry is currently experiencing a trend towards medieval-themed games, such as Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord. A medieval-themed game from Rockstar would certainly be a welcome addition to the genre, and could potentially be one of the standout games of the year.

So what does this mean for the much-anticipated GTA 6? According to the anonymous source, development on the next installment of the franchise has been put on hold indefinitely while the studio focuses on Project Medieval. This will undoubtedly be disappointing news for fans of the series, who have been eagerly waiting for a new GTA game since the release of GTA V in 2013. However, it's worth keeping in mind that Rockstar has always been known for taking its time when developing new games. GTA V took five years to develop, so it's possible that fans may have to wait a little longer for GTA 6.

In conclusion, the news of Rockstar Games turning their attention to a medieval-themed game is certainly surprising, but also exciting. While fans of the Grand Theft Auto franchise may have to wait a little longer for the next installment, the prospect of a new open-world game from Rockstar set in medieval Europe is certainly an intriguing one. We'll have to wait and see if these rumors are true, but for now, we can only imagine what kind of immersive and incredible game Rockstar will create.

There has been a lot of debate circling GTA 6 but it looks like we will have to wait a few more years until we can get our hands on the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series.
 
According to recent leaks, Rockstar the developer behind the GTA Series is working on a game that will be set during Medieval times, the last game developed by Rockstar also featured a period setting but taking the setting of the game multiple centuries back will certainly be a challenge.
 
These leaks come from the same source who gave us insight into the development of Red Dead Redemption 2 and the GTA Online DLC. The new game is scheduled to be released in the first quarter of 2021 on the console, and as trends have shown us the PC version will probably be delayed a year.
 
It is expected to come out for the next generation of consoles which should be more than ready by then and there isnâ€™t any news about this new game being made available for the current generation of consoles.
 
Though the aspect of a grand adventure set in the medieval times with sword fighting and elements of that era curated by Rockstar sounds exciting it is best to take this news with a pinch of salt.
 
We will be following up on this GTA VI leak as and when more information is made available. Follow Gamer Tweak for more GTA 6 Leaks, Updates and rumours.
