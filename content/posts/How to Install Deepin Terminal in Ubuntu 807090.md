Deepin terminal is a python-based terminal emulator, specifically developed for the Chinese Linux distribution called “Deepin.” It has many useful features, some of which, like “quake mode” would usually require a separate application to be installed.
 
## Installing Deepin terminal in Ubuntu
 
Deepin terminal has many Deepin OS-specific dependencies, so installation is not necessarily straightforward on all systems. Fortunately NoobsLab has created a PPA for easy installation of most Deepin specific software. As of the time of writing, NoobsLab’s ppa would work in Ubuntu 14.10 Utopic/14.04 Trusty/12.04 Precise/Linux Mint 17.1 and other Ubuntu derivatives, based on the above versions.
 
To add the PPA and install the software, copy and paste the following lines into your terminal:
 
It will install many dependencies,
 

 
but the new terminal emulator should work flawlessly afterwards. You can start it with the command deepin-terminal or from your usual app-launcher menu.
 
## Features
 
Deepin terminal appears to be a simple terminal emulator, not very different from any other at first glance. While not an exceptionally powerful emulator, it comes with some rather useful features nevertheless.
 
### Keyboard shortcuts
 
Deepin terminal has an extensive list of configurable shortkeys. The defaults are listed below:
 
### Workspaces
 
Deepin terminal now supports multiple workspaces or tabs. To open a new one, press Ctrl + / or right click anywhere in the window and select “New workspace.” You can navigate workspaces with the mouse or with keyboard shortcust (see above).
 
### Split windows
 
Each workspace can be split into multiple tiled subwindows, making multitasking much more effective. There is no theoretical limit as to how many times you can split the window, although obvious usability limitations will apply.
 
### Add SSH servers
 
Deepin terminal makes it easy to add and save SSH servers for later use. This can be quite useful for server administrators using SSH extensively over multiple servers and/or networks.
 
### Quake mode
 
Deepin terminal can be started in “quake mode” which will launch it in a HUD fashion, overlaying your usual desktop. Access quake mode by right-clicking the terminal and selecting “Full screen” or starting it with the “--quake-mode” command line parameter, like this:
 
### … and more
 
Deepin terminal also offers an extensive context-menu
 
and some basic setup options.
 
## Conclusion
 
Deepin terminal is a custom-built terminal emulator for Linux Deepin, which comes with many useful and advanced features. Although it requires Deepin-specific dependencies to be installed, thanks to an existing PPA, it is easy to install and use in Ubuntu or derivative systems.
