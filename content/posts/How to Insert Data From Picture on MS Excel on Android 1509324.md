# Revolutionize Your Data Entry With This Secret Android Trick for Excel - Inserting Information from Pictures Made Easy!

Are you tired of manually entering data into spreadsheets? Do you find it tedious to copy and paste information from pictures or documents into Excel? Well, there's a secret Android trick that can revolutionize your data entry experience! With this trick, you can now insert information from pictures into Excel with ease, saving you time and energy.

## How It Works

The trick involves taking a picture of the information you want to insert into Excel, and then using the 'Insert data from picture' feature in the Excel app for Android. This feature uses artificial intelligence to analyze the picture and extract the data within it. Once the data is extracted, you can easily insert it into your spreadsheet.

## Using the 'Insert Data from Picture' Feature

To use this feature, follow these simple steps:

1. Open the Excel app on your Android device and create a new spreadsheet or open an existing one.
2. Tap on the cell where you want to insert the data from the picture.
3. Tap on the 'Insert data from picture' icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen. This will open your device's camera app.
4. Take a picture of the information you want to insert into Excel. Make sure the picture is clear and the information is legible.
5. After taking the picture, the Excel app will analyze it and extract the data. You can review the extracted data and make any necessary corrections.
6. Once you are satisfied with the extracted data, tap on the 'Insert' button to insert it into the selected cell.

## Benefits of Using This Trick

The 'Insert data from picture' feature in the Excel app for Android can save you time and energy by eliminating the need to manually enter data into spreadsheets. This feature is especially useful if you frequently have to enter data from receipts, invoices, or other documents into your spreadsheets. With this feature, you can simply take a picture of the document and insert the data into your spreadsheet in seconds.

## Limitations

While this feature is convenient, it's important to note that it does have some limitations. The feature relies on artificial intelligence to analyze the picture and extract the data, so it may not always be accurate. The accuracy of the feature also depends on the quality of the picture and the legibility of the information. Additionally, this feature is only available in the Excel app for Android, so if you use Excel on a different platform, you won't be able to take advantage of this trick.

## Conclusion

If you're tired of manually entering data into spreadsheets, then this secret Android trick can revolutionize your data entry experience. With the 'Insert data from picture' feature in the Excel app for Android, you can easily insert information from pictures into Excel, saving you time and energy. While this feature does have some limitations, it's a useful tool to have in your data entry arsenal.

The MS Excel app for Android allows you to easily create and edit spreadsheets on your phone. However, it can be difficult to be productive on a small screen, where much of the menu and options are hidden by default. Thankfully, there is an option that lets you insert data from a picture instead of typing it in manually. Check out how you can insert data from a picture on the MS Excel Android app.
 
## How to Insert Data from a Picture on MS Excel Android
 
1. Open the MS Excel app and the spreadsheet where you want to insert data from a picture on your Android device.
 
Note: you can use the spreadsheet either in portrait or landscape mode. We would advise using it in landscape mode to make things easier.
 
2. On the icon toolbar at the bottom, tap on the icon to reveal the built-in options. 
 
3. Tap on the icon that has a “table with camera icon,” which is the second to the last option before the “bulb” icon. 
 
Alternatively, you can also hit the “Edit” icon at the top “Ribbon.” Select “Insert” from the menu and the “Data from Picture” option.
 
4. When you select the “Data from Picture” option, if you are using it for the first time, it will ask for camera permissions. Grant the required permission to open the camera app. 
 
Notably, the camera interface will show a “Gallery” icon. We are using this option for this guide. 
 
5. Select the image, and after adjusting the crop area, hit the “Continue” button at the bottom.
 
6. You will see a progress bar that says: “Extracting.” Once completed, you can copy, edit or paste the data from the picture to your workbook.
 
It is advised that you review the extracted data once before you copy and paste in it your actual workbook. There is no guarantee that the extracted data is 100% accurate.
