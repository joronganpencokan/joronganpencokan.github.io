Here, you'll see options like capturing audio from the game, adding a microphone for voiceovers, and choosing the video quality (720p or 1080p).

Once you've finished recording, you'll have a few options on what to do next. You can immediately post your screencast to social media, save it to your computer, or edit it using a video editing tool. You can even trim your recording to remove any parts you don't want to use.

##   What Is a Screencast?  
 

A screencast is a recorded video of your Windows desktop. They are often used to create instructional videos for how to carry out a set of actions inside a program. If you wanted to teach someone how to convert a document in Microsoft Word from DOCX to DOC, for example, you could record a screencast of you going through the steps.

 
Videos recorded with the Game Bar can be quite large. If you want greater control over file size, download a screencast program with more advanced features.
 
##   How does the Xbox Game Bar Record Screencasts?  
 

The Xbox Game Bar is designed to record gameplay for PC games, but it can also be used for recording other apps. Recordings can then be shared to platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and the Xbox network.

 

Unfortunately, there are some limitations. The Game Bar can't capture your entire desktop; the Windows taskbar is omitted. It will only work inside a single program at a time, and there may be programs for which the record feature doesn't work at all.
