Unveiled: The Magnificent World of Gravure Printing - Discover the Technique Behind Mesmerizing Printed Artworks!

Printing has been around for centuries, and throughout the years, it has evolved dramatically. From woodblock printing in ancient China to modern-day digital printing, printing techniques have constantly changed and improved. One such technique that has been used for over a century is gravure printing. In this article, we will take you through the marvelous world of Gravure printing, its history, technique, and how it is used to create stunning artworks.

Gravure printing, also known as intaglio printing, is a printing technique that involves etching or engraving a smooth metal plate or cylinder with an image. This etched or engraved area comes in contact with the ink, which is then transferred to paper or other substrates.

The history of Gravure printing can be traced back to the mid-19th century, with the invention of a method to transfer photographic images onto metal plates. This technique was further developed by the Frenchman Karl Klic in the late 1800s, and by the turn of the century, it was widely used for printing illustrations in newspapers, magazines, and books.

The process of Gravure printing begins with the photographer taking a photo, which is then converted into a film positive. This is used to make an etching plate, which is coated with a photosensitive material. After the plate is exposed to light, the exposed areas become hardened, while the unexposed areas remain soft. The plate is then washed with a solvent, which removes the soft areas, leaving behind a relief in the surface. This relief is then inked, and the plate is pressed against the paper to create the final print.

The technique of Gravure printing allows for fine detail, tonal range, and rich color reproduction. This makes it an ideal printing process for high-quality reproduction of photographs and artworks. Gravure printing is used in a wide range of applications, including packaging, labels, wallpapers, and fine art prints.

One notable example of Gravure printing in use is the album cover of Pink Floyd's "Animals." The artwork for the cover was created by Roger Waters and Storm Thorgerson, who used a photograph of a pig floating above Battersea Power Station in London. This photograph was converted into a Gravure plate, which was used to print the album cover.

The intricate and mesmerizing prints created by Gravure printing have inspired many artists and photographers to use this technique to create unique and stunning artworks. Among them are photographers like Sally Mann and Andreas Gurksy.

In conclusion, Gravure printing is a remarkable technique that has stood the test of time. Its ability to reproduce fine details, tonal range, and rich colors makes it a valuable printing process for reproduction of photographs and artworks. Its versatility has enabled its use in various applications, including packaging, labels, fine art prints, and album covers. The world of Gravure printing is indeed magnificent, and those who take the time to discover its technique and uses will be rewarded with mesmerizing printed artworks.

Gravure printing—also known as rotogravure printing—is primarily a long-run, high-speed, high-quality printing method. Like engraving, gravure is a form of intaglio printing that produces fine, detailed images. It works well for CMYK printing where each color of ink is applied by its own cylinder and with drying steps in between.

 

Like flexography, gravure printing predominates in the high-volume printing of packaging, wallpaper and gift wrap. Although less common, it also works for printing magazines, greeting cards, and high-volume advertising pieces.

 
##   How Gravure Works  
 

In gravure printing, an image is acid-etched on the surface of a metal cylinder—one cylinder for each color—in a pattern of cells. The cells are recessed into the cylinder, unlike relief printing or letterpress where the printing image is raised or like offset printing, in which the image is level with the plate.

 

The cylinder is etched with cells of different depths. These cells hold the ink that is transferred to the substrate. The dimensions of the cells must be precise because the deeper cells produce more intensive color than shallow cells.

 

The cells are filled with ink, and the non-printing portions of the plate or cylinder are wiped or scraped free of ink. Then paper or another substrate is pressed against the inked cylinder on a rotary press, and the image is transferred directly to the paper, unlike in offset printing, which uses an interim cylinder. The engraved cylinder sits partially immersed in the ink fountain, where it picks up ink to fill its recessed cells on each rotation of the press.

 
Although the digital file preparation requirements for gravure printing are similar to those of offset printing, contact the gravure print shop for any specific requirements concerning their digital files.
 
##   Photogravure  
 

Photogravure is a variation on engraved-cylinder gravure printing. Photogravure uses photographic methods to etch copper plates that are then wrapped onto cylinders, rather than etching the cylinders themselves. Because this is a less costly process, photogravure lends itself to shorter runs of high-quality printing and is commonly used to reproduce high-end art prints with warm blacks and a wide range of subtle shades of colors.
