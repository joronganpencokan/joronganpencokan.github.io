It's essential to know the ins and outs of your chosen class. By understanding your class, you'll be able to use their unique abilities to your advantage. For example, if you're playing as a Hunter, you can use your weapon's Photon Arts and Perfect Guards to deal heavy damage and defend against attacks.

Don't forget to take on quests to earn rewards and experience points as well.

3. Upgrade Your Gear
As you progress through the game, your enemies become stronger, and your gear needs to keep up. Make sure to upgrade your equipment regularly by using Enhancement Items found in the game. You can also enhance your gear by using Grinders, which increase their stats. Don't be afraid to experiment with different weapons to find what works best for you.

4. Join a Party
Playing with a group of friends can make the journey through PSO2 New Genesis even more fun. Plus, by joining a party, you'll be able to take on more challenging quests, and the members can help you level up quicker. Make sure to communicate with your team and work together to take down tough enemies.

5. Master the Perfect Guard
Perfect Guarding is a technique that allows you to block an enemy attack at the precise moment, leaving them vulnerable to a counter-attack. Mastering the perfect guard technique can be challenging, but it's a powerful tool that can save your life in the game's tougher battles.

Final Thoughts
With these surprising tips, you'll be able to unleash your true power in PSO2 New Genesis.
