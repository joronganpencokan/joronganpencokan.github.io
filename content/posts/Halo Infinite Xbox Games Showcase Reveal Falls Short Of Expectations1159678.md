Title: You Won't Believe What Went Wrong at the Halo Infinite Xbox Games Showcase Reveal - Fans Are Furious!

Are you a fan of Halo? If yes, then you must have been eagerly waiting for the Xbox Games Showcase Reveal of the latest addition to the Halo game series- Halo Infinite. The reveal finally happened on July 23, 2020, and it was supposed to be an exciting moment for all the Halo fans out there. However, things did not go as planned, leaving the fans disappointed and furious.

One of the most significant issues that the fans noticed was with the graphics of the game. The graphics appeared to be outdated and lacking in detail, which is not something that was expected from a game that has been in development for five years. The fans were especially disappointed with the environment and the textures of the game, which seemed to be less detailed than the previous Halo game.

The developers of the game, 343 Industries, tried to defend themselves by saying that the graphics were shown in the gameplay footage were a work in progress and would be improved before the final release of the game. However, many fans are not convinced and are criticizing the developers for a lack of attention to detail and poor planning.

Another major issue that the fans noticed was with the sound effects of the game. The sound effects were not as impactful as they were in the previous Halo games, which was a letdown for many fans. The developers tried to explain that the sound effects were still being worked on, but this did not convince the fans.

Apart from these issues, many fans were disappointed with the lack of innovation in the game. The game seemed to be a continuation of the previous games in the series, without any significant changes or updates. This lack of innovation has left many fans feeling that the developers are running out of ideas.

The Xbox Games Showcase Reveal of Halo Infinite was supposed to be a momentous occasion for the Halo fans, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The lack of attention to detail, poor planning, and the lack of innovation has left many fans furious. While the developers have promised to improve the game, only time will tell if they can live up to the expectations of the Halo fans.

Halo Infinite was the star attraction at Xbox Games Showcase which was a Microsoft event especially focusing on the games that are coming out for the Xbox Series X console, while the choices were far and wide. It was Halo Infinite that the world had held its breath for.
 
Looking at the gameplay reveal, one thing was made abundantly clear, Halo Infinite looks beautiful and unimpressive at the same time. While it may seem like a conflict of interest, the expectations that Halo Infinite carries along with it are crumbling.
 
For long Halo has been the definitive game that has taken the Xbox consoles to people’s households. Halo is a massive franchise and forever will be. So, when the gameplay reveal happened all we got to see was Master Chief bickering and then killing a few aliens.
 

 
You can see in the video above that the character details aren’t as sharp as you’d want them to be, neither does the game look groundbreaking.
 
The entire mystique of Halo for years had been that it was one of the most innovative franchise, the world had ever seen. From brilliant storylines, unbelievable graphics, and gameplay mechanics that would change the FPS genre. Halo has become complacent in recent launches.
 
Today’s Xbox Games Showcase didn’t show off a lot but whatever it did show looked beautiful. You could see Master Chief’s Armor bask in the soft sunlight that lit up the world where his aircraft landed, you saw a few old weapons come to the light which worked brilliantly.
 
One of the key aspects of Halo Infinite was the ray tracing that is going to make the lighting of the game look better than ever before and while it does its job, the details when you see the characters and the environment seems to be missing.
 
Halo Infinite looks more like an Xbox One game which will take advantage of the Xbox Series X console power and architecture rather than a game solely developed for the Xbox Series X. IF this becomes a huge issue when the game releases, well we can’t know until then.
 
But for someone who has been a huge fan of the series since inception, it felt to be let down by one of the best gaming franchises in the history of video games and being let down by Microsoft ahead of the release of their Xbox Series X console.
