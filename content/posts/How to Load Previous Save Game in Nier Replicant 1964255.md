## How to load a Previous Save in Nier Replicant?
 

 
Nier Replicant isn’t a walk in the park and veterans of the franchise are very well aware of this. We would recommend you to save very often as you never know what might happen next. The developers aren’t big fans of saving progress so, unlike other games, Saving progress or loading a previous save isn’t as direct as you think. Players can save their progress at the mailbox in the game, it might be difficult to find these as you might not come across one very often. One is very readily available outside your home but do keep an eye out for these regularly.
 
In case things go south and you want to load a previous save, pause the game and click on the “options” tab. In the Options menu, click on the “other” tab and then click on the “load” tab. Under the “load” section you will find all your saved progress, where you can select the point you want to resume from. Do remember that you only have 3 save slots so use them wisely, do name them accurately so you know which one to overwrite or delete.
