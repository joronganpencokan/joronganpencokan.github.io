## Methods To Convert Image To Excel Cells
 
### Using Online OCR Service
 
There are tons of free and paid online services that let you use OCR technology to scan your image and pdf and convert it into editable formats.

3. Once your file is uploaded to the website, select the language in your image and output format. The output format contains word file, excel file, and plain text.
 
4. After that, press Convert to convert your image file into xlxs. It may take a while depending on the text present in the file.
 
5. You can now download the file or view the text found in it on the site itself. There is one important thing to keep in mind, the OCR tools might not create the exact copy of the table in the converted excel file. In such cases, you will need to make changes and format it afterward.
