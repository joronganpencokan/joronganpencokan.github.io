# You Won't Believe the Chaos Unleashed as GTA Online Turns Free - Hackers and Cheaters Flood the Game!

The gaming world was shaken up recently when Rockstar Games made its popular game Grand Theft Auto Online (GTAO) free for all PlayStation 5 owners. With such a huge influx of players and lack of scrutiny, the game quickly became a playground for hackers and cheaters, causing massive chaos for genuine players.

Reports of cheating and hacking skyrocketed soon after the game was made free. Players who were previously banned or had their accounts suspended easily created new accounts and resumed their cheating habits, causing grief for legitimate players who wanted to experience the game without exploiting its weaknesses.

The chaos was further compounded by the flurry of new players entering the game, some of whom were virgins to the world of GTA. It was a virtual bloodbath, as the seasoned cheaters and hackers took full advantage of their new gaming field.

One popular cheating method was the exploit of the casino glitch, which allowed players to stack up millions of in-game money in minutes, making them instantly all-powerful. This led to a huge imbalance in the game, with cheaters running rampant and spoiling the experience for everyone else.

Hackers also infiltrated the game's chat system, sending spam messages and causing chaos in unsuspecting players' lobbies. They also managed to lock up players in cages, making it nearly impossible for them to escape.

It wasn't all doom and gloom, though. Rockstar Games quickly picked up on the situation and started implementing measures to curb the cheating and hacking activities. In a recent statement, they have vowed to take severe action against any players found to be cheating or exploiting the game's systems.

They also advised genuine players to report any suspicious activity, including sudden wealth or unexplainable game achievements. Players can use Rockstar's reporting system or use external platforms like Reddit to report cheats.

In conclusion, the free release of GTA Online for PS5 owners was a welcome move that saw an influx of new players into the game, but it also created a breeding ground for hackers and cheaters. However, with Rockstar Games taking an aggressive stance against these activities and urging genuine players to report any suspicious behaviors, the future looks bright for the game's constant fight against cheats and hackers. Here's to a future where legitimate players can smoothly run their heists without any interference from cheaters and hackers.

GTA 5 is now already available for free in the Epic Games Store for PC. Because of this, hackers and modders are annoying the game lobbies of GTA Online causing a lot of frustration for other players.
 
Much to the displeasure of the fans, all kinds of nonsense can be done in GTA Online within GTA 5. The PC version, in particular, enables modders to freely design the game world. It is not a new phenomenon that such modders and hackers can get on the nerves of other players in public lobbies.
 
However, since the Epic Games Store made the open-world game available free of charge, this has worsened the online community massively. According to a report by Kotaku, community players have been reporting on social media how hackers and cheaters are making their gameplay experience a hell in GTA Online.
 
A common assumption is that modders and hackers have no real consequences to fear, as they could currently create any number of new accounts for free, even if they were banned. The hackers exploit this shamelessly and spoil the gaming experience of other players. Hackers accomplish this by, for example, spawning a number of planes, trapping players in cages, or deliberately trying to crash the servers, as can be seen in this Reddit post.
 
These annoying actions even go so far that players are not even safe from hackers in the single-player version of GTA 5, as they use existing connections to the server to turn the game world upside down there, as a Reddit user reported.
 
GTA Online players are now looking for a quick fix against these types of hackers. Hopefully, the situation will calm down by itself when the free availability of GTA 5 on Epic Games Store ends. Until then you will have to wait and stay away from public lobbies as far as possible.
