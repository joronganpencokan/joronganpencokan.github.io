Attention Mac Mail Users: Discover the SECRET to Adding Text Links in Emails like a PRO!

Are you tired of plain and boring emails? Do you want to add some creativity to your messages and make them stand out? If you use Mac Mail, then you’re in luck! Our article will provide you with a secret tip to add text links to your emails like a professional.

Text links allow you to add clickable links to words or phrases in your email text. They are a great way to provide additional information, direct users to a specific webpage or product, or even promote your own website. Text links can be a powerful tool in any email marketing campaign, and with the following tip, you can add them effortlessly to your Mac Mail emails.

The secret is using the Hyperlink option in Mac Mail. Follow these easy steps to create a text link and give your emails the professional touch:

Step 1: Highlight the word or phrase that you want to turn into a text link.

Step 2: Click on the Insert menu at the top of your screen, then select Hyperlink (or use the Command + K shortcut).

Step 3: In the Hyperlink window, type or paste the URL that you want the text link to go to. You can also add a title for the link that will appear when the user hovers over it.

Step 4: Click OK, and your text link is now created!

It’s that easy! You can now add as many text links as you want to your email text, and your recipients can click on them directly to visit the webpage or product you want to promote. By using text links, you can add value to your messages, increase engagement with your readers, and stand out in their inboxes.

One important thing to remember is to avoid adding too many links in one email. Overuse of links can be overwhelming for the reader, and they might not click on any of them if there are too many. Also, make sure that your links are relevant to the email message and provide useful information.

In conclusion, text links are a simple and effective way to take your emails to the next level. By using the Hyperlink option in Mac Mail, you can add them in seconds and improve your email marketing success. So, next time you’re drafting an email, don’t forget to incorporate text links and watch the engagement soar!

This article explains how to insert a link in rich text or a URL in plain text emails with Mac OS X Mail. Information on editing or removing a link is included.

##   How to Create a Hyperlink in Rich Text Emails for macOS Mail  
 

Inserting a link to a web page is easy in Mail for macOS. Just copy the webpage's URL from your browser's address bar and paste it into the body of the email. However, the way Mail formats outgoing messages may break the URL you're trying to send. One workaround is to create a hyperlink.

 

To add a clickable link, you must compose your message as rich text.

 
- Open Mail and start a new message.
 - From the menu bar, select Format > Make Rich Text to compose your message in rich text format. (If you see only Make Plain Text, your email is already set for rich text, and you don't have to do anything.)
 - Type your message and highlight the word or phrase that you want to turn into a hyperlink.
 - Under the Edit menu, select Add Link...
 - A box will pop up and ask for the link. Paste the URL and select OK.

 

The appearance of the linked text changes to indicate it is a link. When the email recipient clicks the linked text, the web page will open.

 

Open Mail and start a new message.

 

From the menu bar, select Format > Make Rich Text to compose your message in rich text format. (If you see only Make Plain Text, your email is already set for rich text, and you don't have to do anything.)

 

Type your message and highlight the word or phrase that you want to turn into a hyperlink.

 

Under the Edit menu, select Add Link...

 

A box will pop up and ask for the link. Paste the URL and select OK.

 
##   How to Create Hyperlinks to URLs in Plain Text Emails  
 

Mac Mail won't place a clickable text link in the plain text version of an email, as the plain text format by its nature does not support text links. If you are not sure if the recipient can read emails with rich or HTML formatting, paste the link in the message body directly instead of linking text to it. Follow these steps to make sure Mail does not "break" the link:

 
- Paste the URL on a line of its own.
 - If the URL is longer than 69 characters, use a service like Bitly or TinyURL to make the URL shorter. Mail breaks lines at 70 characters. If the break occurs in the middle of a URL, the link may not be clickable.

 
##   How to Edit or Remove a Link in a macOS Mail Message  
 

If you change your mind, you can change or remove the hyperlink in macOS Mail:

 
- Click anywhere in the text that contains the link.
 - Under the Edit menu, select Edit Link.
 - Select Remove Link > OK. The link will be gone from the highlighted text.
