# Unleash Your Inner Skater Pro: Master the Insane Magic Bum Ollie 5x in THPS 1&2 at Venice Beach Now!

If you are a fan of skateboarding, then the release of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1&2 has undoubtedly been a highlight of your year. The remastered classic brings back memories of shredding through levels as your favorite skater while jamming out to an iconic soundtrack. But, even if you have played the original game countless times, there may be one trick that has always eluded you - the Magic Bum Ollie. In this article, we will guide you through mastering this insane trick and show you how to do it 5x in a row at Venice Beach.

## The Trick

To master the Magic Bum Ollie, you need to know a few things about the game mechanics. First, this trick requires you to manual, which means balancing on two wheels instead of all four. You can do this by pushing the left stick forward (to manual forward) or backward (to manual back). Second, the trick requires you to add a quick flip before landing back on your wheels. To do this, perform a manual and then quickly tap the X button on PlayStation or A button on Xbox to perform a flip trick.

Once you have these basics down, it's time to add in the magic. Performing the Magic Bum Ollie requires a specific combination of inputs that must be done quickly and correctly to pull off the trick. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Start by performing a manual and heading towards a small ledge or curb.
2. As you approach the edge, quickly perform a kickflip by holding down on the left stick and pressing square on PlayStation or X on Xbox.
3. While still in the kickflip animation, perform a boneless (jump without an ollie) by holding down on the D-pad and pressing circle on PlayStation or B on Xbox.
4. While in the boneless animation, perform a quick ollie by tapping the X button on PlayStation or A button on Xbox.
5. Perform a quick flip trick to complete the trick and land back on your wheels.

## The Location

Now that you know how to perform the Magic Bum Ollie, it's time to head to the perfect location to practice and show off your new trick - Venice Beach. Located in Los Angeles, Venice Beach is a famous skating location with smooth and diverse terrain that makes it an ideal spot for skating and performing tricks. Plus, with the beautiful beach and boardwalk in the background, it's a prime location to snap some killer in-game screenshots while showing off your skills.

## The Strategy

To master this trick, you need to practice it over and over again until it becomes muscle memory. Head to Venice Beach and find a small ledge or curb to start practicing on. Approach the edge, perform the trick, and then repeat. Don't get discouraged if you don't land it perfectly the first time. It takes practice to get the timing down and make it look effortless.

One helpful tip is to use the slow-motion feature to perfect your execution. After performing the trick, hold down the right stick to enable slow-motion, and study your timing and muscle memory. Then, try again, making small adjustments until you nail it every time.

## Final Thoughts

The Magic Bum Ollie is an insane trick that requires some skill and patience to master. But, with a little bit of practice and dedication, you can become a master of this trick and show off your skills to your friends. Venice Beach provides the perfect location to hone your skills and take control of the virtual world of skateboarding. So, grab your controller, head to Venice Beach, and unleash your inner skater pro by mastering this insane trick!

### Ollie the Magic Bum Location 1
 

 
When you start the level, go straight and then go in the north-west direction. Once you take a right there, you will see the first Magic Bum sleeping that you have to Ollie over. He will call you a nuisance but by then you will be on your way to the next Magic Bum.
 
### Location 2
 
Turn and go back the same way you came from and take a right here. You will see stairs so go downwards and when you move a bit forward, you will see the second Magic Bum next to the wall.
 
### Location 3
 
For the third Bum, turn and go back to the main area again and then go right. Take the stairs on the right side and then take a left. He will be near a long grass patch so go ahead and Ollie over him.
 
### Location 4
 
Go slightly ahead from there and take a left and then another left. That’s the fourth Magic Bum in THPS.
 
### Location 5
 
Finally, you have to go back from where you came and keep going straight (at this point the long grass patch will be on your right). Next to a trash can, the last Magic Bum will be sleeping.
