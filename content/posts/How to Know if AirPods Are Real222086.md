# Exposed: Shocking Truth Revealed on How to Spot Fake Airpods in Seconds!

Are you a big fan of Apple Airpods but struggling to identify fake ones from the real deal? You are not alone. Many people are falling for counterfeit Airpods, and it's challenging to tell the difference between genuine and fake ones.

In this article, we'll reveal some shocking truths on how to spot fake Airpods in seconds. Read on to learn more.

## Check the Packaging

One of the most obvious ways to identify fake Airpods is by examining the packaging. Real Airpods come in a white box with text in gray letters, while fake ones have different colors, logos, or misspellings.

You should also check that the box has the same size and labels as the ones on the official Apple site. Look for any discrepancies in the serial numbers, logos, or packaging.

## Look for Logo Differences

Another way to spot fake Airpods is by examining the logos. Check for any differences or inaccuracies in the Apple logo or branding. Authentic Airpods usually have the letters 'TM' in the logo, which denotes a trademark, while fake ones tend to have the letters 'R,' which means registered.

You should examine the font size, spacing, and color to determine whether the Airpods are legit. Some fake Airpods have spelling errors, or their logos might be smaller or larger than the original.

## Compare the Price

If the price seems too good to be true, then it probably is. The average cost of Airpods is around $159, and any price much lower than that should raise a red flag. Fake Airpods are usually cheaper, and sellers often try to lure customers with attractive prices.

## Check for Connectivity

A significant difference between genuine Airpods and fake ones is their connectivity. Real Airpods can connect seamlessly to other Apple devices through Bluetooth, while fake ones' connection is unreliable and weak.

You can check the connectivity by going to the Bluetooth settings on your device and checking if the Airpods are listed as a device. You can also test the connection strength by walking around with the Airpods.

## Sound Quality

The sound quality is another way to spot fake Airpods. Authentic Airpods produce high-quality sound, and the microphones work correctly, while fake ones often produce a muffled or low-quality sound. The bass might be weak, and the sound might cut out frequently.

You can test the sound quality by playing music or making phone calls. If the sound quality is low, then it's likely fake Airpods.

In conclusion, spotting fake Airpods is essential before parting with your cash. Always check the packaging, branding, connectivity, price, and sound quality to determine whether the Airpods are genuine. Don't fall for attractive offers that might end up being fake. Use these tips to identify fake Airpods in seconds, and you'll be able to enjoy the real deal.

Worried you have fake AirPods, or you may be about to buy some? This article provides some foolproof tips and tricks to help you spot fake AirPods.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Check AirPods's serial number in Apple's coverage checking tool. If they show up there, your AirPods are authentic.Open the case next to an iPhone or iPad and press the button on the case. Only real AirPods open a window to connect/show battery life.

 
##   How to Tell If AirPods Are Fake: Check the Serial Number  
 

The most foolproof way to tell if AirPods are fake is to go directly to the source: Apple. Apple has an online to check a product's warranty status. Just enter the AirPods' serial number and, if you find them there, they're the real deal. If you don't, you've spotted fake AirPods. Here's what to do:

 
- In your web browser, go to Apple's coverage checking tool.
 - Find your AirPods' serial number on the box or, if you've already connected them to your iPhone, by going to Settings > Bluetooth > tapping the i next to the AirPods name.
 - Enter the serial number, the CAPTCHA, and click Continue.
 - If the tool returns information for that serial number (especially a valid purchased date), the AirPods are real.

 
##   How to Tell If AirPods Are Fake: Try to Pair Them or Check Battery Life  
 

Another reliable way to tell if AirPods are fake is by doing something only authentic AirPods can do.

 

In your web browser, go to Apple's coverage checking tool.

 

Find your AirPods' serial number on the box or, if you've already connected them to your iPhone, by going to Settings > Bluetooth > tapping the i next to the AirPods name.

 

Enter the serial number, the CAPTCHA, and click Continue.

 

If the tool returns information for that serial number (especially a valid purchased date), the AirPods are real.

 

When you try to pair AirPods to an iPhone or iPad, or open already-paired AirPods near those devices, a window pops up on the device's screen. That can only happen with genuine AirPods because that feature relies on the W1 chip, a communications chip Apple created for the AirPods. It's extremely unlikely fake AirPods could mimic that feature.

 

So, to spot fake AirPods using this trick, follow these steps:

 
- Make sure the AirPods are charged.
 - Hold the AirPods next to an iPhone or iPad, which has Bluetooth turned on. Open the AirPods case (while leaving the earbuds in the case).
 - If the AirPods have already been set up with this device, the battery screen will appear. That means your AirPods are genuine.
 - If the AirPods haven't been set up with this device, wait for the connection screen to appear. If it does, your AirPods are the real thing.

 

If you follow these steps but don't see the images from steps 3 or 4 on your device's screen, we're sorry to tell you, but your AirPods are probably fake.

 

Make sure the AirPods are charged.

 

Hold the AirPods next to an iPhone or iPad, which has Bluetooth turned on. Open the AirPods case (while leaving the earbuds in the case).

 

If the AirPods have already been set up with this device, the battery screen will appear. That means your AirPods are genuine.

 

If the AirPods haven't been set up with this device, wait for the connection screen to appear. If it does, your AirPods are the real thing.

 
##   How to Spot Fake AirPods: Packaging, Manufacturing, and More  
 

Checking the serial number and AirPods-only features is the most reliable way to spot fake AirPods, but you can use some other methods. These options include some guessing, so we recommend the options from earlier in the article, but you can try these, too:

 
Sometimes genuine AirPods have problems connecting or don't work properly. In that case, check out our tips on how to fix them by reading How to Fix It When AirPods Won't Connect and How to Fix AirPods When They're Not Working.
 
- Price: Apple products aren't cheap. The starting retail price for regular AirPods is $159, and AirPods Pro is $249. If you paid much less than that—say, $50 for AirPods Pro—they might not be real.
 - Wireless Charging Case: The charging case included with the second-generation AirPods and AirPods Pro supports Qi wireless charging. It's unlikely copycats would throw in this expensive feature. Try putting your AirPods case on a Qi charging mat. If it doesn't get any power, it might be a fake.
 - Build Quality: Apple is famous for the very high quality of its devices. You shouldn't see any seams in the plastic, the ports and connectors are tight and sturdy, and the color of white products (like AirPods) is clean and bright. If your AirPods seem a little low quality, the pieces are loose, or the color isn't perfect, you might have knock-off AirPods.
 - Packaging: Just like the build quality of Apple products is high, so is the packaging quality. The boxes' fit is tight, the quality of the printing high, the placement of stickers perfect. Apple's quality control for its products is exacting, so if your AirPods don't meet that mark, they could be fake.
