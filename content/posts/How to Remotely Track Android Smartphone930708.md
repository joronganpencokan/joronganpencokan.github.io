# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Remotely Track any Android Smartphone!

Have you ever misplaced or lost your android smartphone and wished you could easily locate it? Well, you may be surprised to know that tracking your lost phone is not as challenging as you may think. Remote tracking technology has made it easy to track any android phone, even if you do not have physical access to the device.

The advancement in technology has made it possible to track an Android device even after it is lost or stolen. All you need is a trusted location tracker and a few minutes of online access to track the device remotely. In this article, we explore the various ways to remotely track an Android phone.

## Using Google's Find My Device Feature

One prominent way to track an Android device is by using Google's Find My Device feature. This feature enables you to track your phone's location and erase its data remotely. The following are the steps to enable the Find My Device feature:

1. Go to your Google account settings, select security and click on the Find My Device option. 

2. Turn on the location feature and the Find My Device option.

3. Download the Find My Device app on another android device or log in to google.com/android/find on any device.

4. Sign in to the device location website, and it will instantly show you the location of your lost android device if it is turned on and online.

If you can't track your device with this feature, you can take further steps such as wiping all data remotely or remotely locking the device.

## Using Third-party Apps

Some third-party apps can also help track your android device remotely. Most of these apps are available for free, while others come at a small cost. They have the same features as Google's Find My Device, but they offer more flexibility options. Here are the most widely used tracking apps available on the Google Play Store:

1. Where's My Droid: This tracking app allows you to track your lost device's location, wipe all data or lock the device remotely. 

2. Anti-Theft: This app has a unique feature that takes pictures of any person who tries to access your phone with the wrong password repeatedly.

3. Mobile Tracker Free: This app can help you track the GPS location on the mobile, and read the text messages and view the call logs on the lost phone.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, remote tracking has enabled several users to recover their lost or stolen android devices in a matter of minutes. Google's Find My Device feature is an excellent place to start if you want to track your device as it provides a free, simple and effective way to locate it. However, if you need more advanced features, third-party apps such as Where's My Droid or Anti-Theft may suit your needs better. Regardless, it's essential always to keep your android devices with you, prevent it from being lost or stolen, and protect your personal information.

Smartphones have now become an internal part of our lives. While as adults, we know what’s good or bad for us, the same cannot be said for kids. Given how much of a necessity it has become to own a smartphone nowadays, parents are left with little choice but to give their kids a smartphone while they are still studying in school.

This makes it important to keep a track on what they do with their smartphones, who they talk to and just keep an overall tab on their activity. While some may consider this as a breach of privacy, giving too much freedom to your kids at a young age can also be harmful and keeping a tab on their activity is not going to harm anyone.
