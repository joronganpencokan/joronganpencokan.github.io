# The Ultimate Guide To Unlocking Infinite Inventory Space In Witcher 3 - You Won't Believe How Easy It Is!

If you are a fan of the Witcher 3 and have been scouring the game's vast open-world for treasure, you know how quickly inventory space can fill up. With a limited inventory, you might find yourself constantly having to manage items by selling, dismantling, or even dropping them. But what if I told you that you could have **infinite inventory space** without the need to manage your inventory at all? Yes, you heard it right – it's easy and here's how you can do it.

## Step 1 – Obtain A "Saddlebags" Skill

Saddlebags are a popular addition to the Witcher 3 game, and they provide a handy inventory management solution that can grow based on how you develop your character. Search far and wide, and you'll discover a long list of saddlebags that can be attached to any horse. 

One of the most useful saddlebags in the game is the "Erlenhorn" saddlebag that can be purchased from the merchant at the end of the Main Street in Novigrad. The saddlebag has a base capacity of +100, but you can unlock the **infinite inventory space** upgrade by equipping the saddlebag while acquiring a skill that helps to activate the infinite inventory space upgrade. The crucial skill can be found in the General Skill Tree, and it's called "Strong Back." Purchase this skill to activate the infinite inventory space upgrade.

## Step 2 – Find An Alchemist And Purchase "Dye Mutagens."

Once you've got your hands on the "Strong Back" skill, the next step is to travel to an alchemist and purchase "dye mutagens." Dye Mutagens are unique in that they can be dismantled into "white dye," "red dye," "blue dye," and "green dye." These dyes can be used to create the glyphs described below. 

After buying the "Dye Mutagens" from an alchemist, dismantle them into the various dyes using the "Dismantle" feature available in the game menu.

## Step 3 – Create Glyphs Using The Dyes And The Crafting System

Once you've dismantled the "Dye Mutagens" into various dye colors, it's time to use them to craft glyphs. Crafting glyphs are an essential step to achieve** infinite inventory space.**

To craft a Glyph, select any Armor item you own and scroll across to the Glyph section. Each Glyph requires a set of different colored dyes to be crafted. Add the dyes and craft the glyph. You should aim to create at least **20 glyphs** in different armor items to activate the **infinite inventory space** upgrade.

## Step 4 – Equip The Armor Items With The Glyphs To Activate Unlimited Inventory

Once you have crafted and equipped your armor items with the Glyphs, you can now have **infinite inventory space**! As you would have noticed, the Infinity symbol appears in your inventory space once you have equipped the necessary items, which means you can now carry infinite items. 

## Final Thoughts

In conclusion, this is a very easy way to upgrade your inventory space countless times without worrying about selling or dismantling items frequently. Acquiring the "Strong Back" skill, buying the "Dye Mutagens," dismantling them into different dyes, crafting 20 glyphs, and equipping them on your armor items are easy-to-follow steps that open up the unlimited inventory option. Happy playing!
