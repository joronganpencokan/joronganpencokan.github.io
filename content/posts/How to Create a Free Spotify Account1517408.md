To use Spotify for free, you'll need to create an account. You can use Spotify's web player to stream music or download the desktop software. The desktop player offers enhanced functionality, such as the ability to import your music library into the Spotify player. There's also the Spotify app for iOS, Android, and other mobile operating systems.
