Title: You'll Never Believe How to Keep Apps From Detecting Root Access on Your Android!

Are you tired of being denied access to your favorite apps because they detect that your Android device is rooted? Rooting your Android device can help you customize it and make it work better for you. However, it comes with some limitations especially with regards to apps that require a secure environment. 

In this article, we will show you how to keep apps from detecting root access on your Android device.

Step 1: Use Magisk Manager

Magisk Manager is a free third-party app that allows you to manage root access on your Android device. It is designed to bypass root detection by creating a virtual environment where you can run your apps without the apps detecting the root access. 

To use Magisk Manager, you have to download the app from the official website and install it on your device. Once installed, open the app and click on the "install" button to install Magisk on your device. After installation, restart your device.

Step 2: Install Magisk module

After restarting your device, open Magisk Manager and click on the "Downloads" tab. Look for the module "MagiskHide Props Config" and install it. This module allows you to trick apps into thinking that your device is not rooted.

Step 3: Configure MagiskHide

After installing the Magisk module, open Magisk Manager and go to the "MagiskHide" section. Look for the app that you want to hide root access from and enable MagiskHide for that app. This will prevent the app from detecting the root access on your device.

Step 4: Verify MagiskHide is working

To verify that MagiskHide is working, you can download a root checker app and check if it detects root access. If it doesn't, then MagiskHide is working correctly.

Conclusion:
Rooting your Android device is a great way to customize it and make it work better for you. However, it comes with some limitations when it comes to using secure apps. By using Magisk Manager and the MagiskHide module, you can bypass root detection and use your favorite apps without any limitations. Give it a try and see for yourself!
