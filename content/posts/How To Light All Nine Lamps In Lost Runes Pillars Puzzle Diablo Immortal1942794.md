# Unleash Your Inner Puzzle Master: The Ultimate Guide to Lighting ALL Nine Lamps in Lost Runes Pillars Puzzle - Diablo Immortal Sneak Peek Revealed!

Are you ready to embark on a new challenge? Diablo Immortal, the upcoming mobile game in the popular Diablo franchise, has already impressed fans with its impressive graphics, deep storyline, and immersive gameplay. But one of the most exciting features of the game is its intricate puzzles. And today, we're going to talk about the Lost Runes Pillars Puzzle and how to light all nine lamps.

But before we dive into the puzzle, let's give a quick introduction to Diablo Immortal. Developed by Blizzard Entertainment and NetEase, the game is set between the events of Diablo II and III, and takes place in the chaotic aftermath of the destruction of the Worldstone. Players can choose from six iconic classes - Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Necromancer, and Wizard - and explore Sanctuary to uncover the dark forces at work.

Now, let's get back to the puzzle. The Lost Runes Pillars Puzzle is one of the most challenging and rewarding puzzles in Diablo Immortal. The objective of the puzzle is to light all nine lamps by manipulating nine pillars, each with a unique rune. The lamps are positioned at the center of a circular area, and the pillars surround it in three circles.

Here are the steps to solve the puzzle:

Step 1: Understand the Pattern

The first step is to observe the pattern of the runes on the pillars. There are three unique runes, repeated in a specific order on each pillar. The order of the runes is different for each pillar.

Step 2: Identify the Starting Point

The second step is to identify which pillar must be used as the starting point. The starting pillar is the one that has a rune in the same position as the lamp that is opposite to it.

Step 3: Light the First Lamp

The third step is to manipulate the starting pillar in such a way that its rune is aligned with the rune on the next pillar in the pattern. Once the first two pillars are aligned, light the lamp between them.

Step 4: Repeat the Process

The fourth step is to repeat the process of aligning and lighting for each of the nine pillars, until all the lamps are lit. Remember to always manipulate the pillar that has a rune in the same position as the lamp that is opposite to it.

Step 5: Celebrate Your Victory!

Congratulations! You have successfully solved the Lost Runes Pillars Puzzle and lit all nine lamps. Take a moment to appreciate your inner puzzle master and the satisfaction of completing one of the most challenging puzzles in Diablo Immortal.

As you can see, the Lost Runes Pillars Puzzle is not an easy one to solve. But with patience, observation, and a bit of trial and error, you can master it and add another trophy to your collection.

And that's not all. Diablo Immortal promises to have more puzzles and challenges like this, each one more complex and rewarding than the last. So, gear up and get ready to explore the dark corners of Sanctuary, unleash your inner puzzle master, and conquer whatever challenges come your way.
