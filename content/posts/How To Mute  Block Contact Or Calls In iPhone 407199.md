You might get so many text messages and calls that sometimes you hate it when your phone goes off with the calls or notifications. 
 
Though it is what a mobile phone is made for, certain calls or messages can really annoy a person if it is out of bounds. If you are irritated or disturbed by a contact in iPhone then you can very well mute or block the contact as desired.
 
You can simply silence your iPhone which will turn off all the notifications sounds for all the calls and messages including the camera shutter sound. 
 
But what if you only wish to silent specific calls/messages or contacts. This is where our tutorial will help you out. Using the methods mentioned here you can mute or block the desired contacts only.
 
## Mute Contact In iPhone
 
In case you are annoyed by continuous messages from particular contact(s) then you can very well mute that conversation and get rid of the disturbing notifications from that person. In order to mute an individual contact or multiple contacts follow the steps given below:
 
Open the Messages Application. Now there are two methods to mute a contact and their text message notification.
 
### Method 1

Then three options will appear under it, here select the third one i.e. info. Next, in the new Detail screen you will see the option Hide Alerts, turn the toggle switch on and the contact is muted successfully.
 
### Method 2
 
Another way is directly from the messaging app. Here swipe left on the contact you wish to mute, and you will see Hide Alerts option inside the purple box. Select it.
 
After you enable Hide Alerts for the conversation you won’t get the notifications of messages from that contact and all the messages will be silent from that contact. You can note the moon icon before that contact in Messages app which signifies that Do Not Disturb is turned on for that conversation.
 
To remove the contact from mute, just head to the same settings and then turn off the Hide Alerts switch or select the Show Alerts option from the Messages app.
 
Note that even if you mute the conversation by using the above steps, the calls will not be silenced. To mute calls, you need to follow the steps below.
 
- Download a silent ringtone. You can find it easily online.After that, add that ringtone to your iPhone by syncing it from iTunes.Now, set that silent ringtone for that particular contact.If you wish you can also set the vibration for the specific contact to None.
