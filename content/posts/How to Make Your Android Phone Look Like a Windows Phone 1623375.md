Transform Your Boring Android Phone into a Sleek and Stylish Windows Device in Just 5 Easy Steps!

Are you tired of using the same old Android interface? Do you want to give a fresh and stylish look to your device? You do not have to buy a new phone to get the Windows experience. With just a few steps, you can transform your boring Android phone into a sleek and stylish Windows device. Here are the 5 easy steps that you can follow to accomplish this transformation:

Step 1: Install a Windows Launcher

The first and the most crucial step is to install a Windows Launcher on your Android Phone. A launcher is an application that replaces your phone's default home screen, app drawer, and other essential components. There are many Launcher applications available in the Google Play Store, but we recommend the Microsoft Launcher. It is free to download and provides you with the most authentic Windows experience.

Step 2: Configure the Microsoft Launcher

Once you have installed the Microsoft Launcher, the next step is to configure it according to your needs. To do this, you have to open the Microsoft Launcher and follow the guidelines given by the app. You can customize your Launcher by choosing a theme, adding widgets, and changing your device's font.

Step 3: Install Windows Apps

The next step is to install Microsoft's apps on your Android device. You can find these apps in the Google Play Store, and most of them are free. Install apps such as Microsoft Office, OneNote, Skype, and the Edge browser to enjoy a seamless Windows experience on your device.

Step 4: Set Windows Wallpaper

One of the noticeable features of Windows is its wallpapers. You can replicate the same Windows feel by setting a high-quality Windows wallpaper on your Android device's home screen. You can download Windows themes and wallpapers from Microsoft's website or search for them on Google.

Step 5: Disable Android Features

To get the full Windows experience, you can disable Android's features that are not needed. For instance, you can disable the Google Assistant or Google Widget on your home screen to give a more refined Windows look.

In Conclusion

In just five easy steps, you can transform your boring Android phone into a sleek and stylish Windows device. You can download Windows-themed launchers, configure them, install Windows apps, set Windows wallpapers, and disable Android features. This process may take some time, but it is worth it. So, what are you waiting for? Get started and transform your phone's interface today!

Windows Phone is dead. It’s been a long time coming, what with Microsoft’s mobile platform being born with the fatal defect of “Not Android or iOS Syndrome.” The Windows Phone had some noble ambitions, trying to fuse itself seamlessly with the PC version of Windows, but in the end it just didn’t get enough support. However, there are some things from the Windows Phone that are worth keeping, and luckily many of them are available in one form or another on Android.
 
Here are the tools and apps that will keep a piece of that Windows Phone magic alive, long after it’s gone to the great mobile market in the sky.
 
## Launcher 8 WP Style
 

 
The name of this app may be all over the place, but don’t let that deter you if you’re looking for a convincing tile-based interface, harkening back to the “glory” days of Windows 8. While the tile stuff didn’t really work out on desktop, it works very nicely on touchscreens, and you get all the joys of changeable tile sizes, Windows theming, and live tiles as well, which dynamically flip over to let you know when someone’s trying to contact you or when you’ve received an email.
 
## SquareHome 2
 
Alternatively, if you want to go a bit more contemporary, you could try SquareHome 2, which is perhaps a little more elegant than Launcher 8. The animations of the tiles are lovely, and app icons are integrated into the tile interface, rather than replaced with more generic icons. If you find the tiles a bit garish, you can add backgrounds and add transparency effects to the tiles, giving it a nice slick appearance. The tiles are live, and it also comes with its own Smart App Drawer which prioritizes your most-used apps.
 
## Cortana
 
If you use voice assistants, then you’ll be aware that they largely define your mobile experience. Google Now (or Google Assistant as it’s come to be known) is Android all over, and if you want to truly get that Windows Phone experience (with the perks of Android’s customizability and Play Store, of course), you need to get Microsoft’s digital assistant, Cortana. It has much the same functionality as Google Assistant, is regularly updated, and syncs up nicely with Windows, too.
 
Here’s our guide to replacing Google Now with Cortana on Android.
 
## A.I. Type Keyboard
 
A.I. Type Keyboard isn’t specifically designed to recreate the Windows Phone feel, but it has so many customization options contained in it that you can do just that. A couple of the free themes in this app are “Windows 8 Tablet Theme” or “Windows Phone 7 Theme,” which accurately mimic the dark look of the keyboards found on Windows Phone devices. If you fancy yourself as a bit of a designer, you can even customize the existing theme to your liking!
 
## Microsoft Office
 
The trifecta of Microsoft Office apps – Word, Excel and PowerPoint – came to Android a couple of years ago, and it’s safe to say that they’ve been a great success. The polished look and feel of these apps makes them the very best that you can get on Android, and frankly their wealth of features puts Android’s native office suite – Docs, Sheets and Slides – to shame. A real masterclass of app design, this suite shows that even though Microsoft has bowed out of the hardware game on Android, it has a bright future on the software front.
 
## Conclusion
 
With this lot, you’ll be able to pay fitting tribute to Windows Phone using your Android device. There was a lot to be said for Windows Phone, but it really didn’t cut it in the apps department, so here you get the best of both worlds. Even if you’re not that into Windows Phone (hence you’re on Android), it’s fun to tweak things, right? So do give it a go.
