Have you thought about giving WhatsApp a break but don’t want to delete and reinstall the app? Ever wondered if you could just sign out of WhatsApp like you do Instagram or Twitter? 
 
You can and it’s pretty easy too. I’ve put together a handy tutorial to show you just how to do it.
 
I’ve also made sure to cover all the devices: Android, iPhone, and desktop. Read on to learn how to sign out of your WhatsApp account. 
 
## How To Log Out Of WhatsApp On Android
 
WhatsApp is the most used mobile messenger app in the world. Many Android users enjoy it because of its wide feature set and popularity. An interesting fact is that the average Android user spends about 38 minutes a day on WhatsApp. 
 
However, if you want a break and want to log off the WhatsApp app on your Android. Here’s how to do it:
 
- Before you log off your WhatsApp account, make sure you back up your WhatsApp data. Open WhatsApp, tap the three vertical dots to the top right of the screen, and select Settings.Next, tap Chats from the dropdown menu to access the Chats settings.Afterward, tap the Chat Backup option then tap the Back Up button to create a backup.Once your backup is finished, tap Settings and then tap the Apps section.Find and tap WhatsApp from the list of apps available.Next tap Storage to access its storage settings.Lastly, tap Clear Data to erase all of your WhatsApp data and log out.Now, you’ll see the login screen the next time you open WhatsApp.

 
Here’s a video demonstration of how to sign out of WhatsApp on Android:
 

 
Clearing an app’s data is also a great way to save storage too. And in the case of your browser, it can clear your browser history, as well. 
 
## Log Out Of WhatsApp On iOS
 
WhatsApp is also a popular messaging app on iOS, as well. In fact, WhatsApp launched almost a year earlier on the App Store than it did on Google Play Store. 
 
Unfortunately, unlike Android, there isn’t an option to log out of WhatsApp on iOS devices. There also isn’t an option to clear data on iPhone either. 
 
Therefore, if you really want to sign out of WhatsApp on your iOS device then you need to delete it. 
 
Here’s how to do it:
 
- Before you remove WhatsApp from your iOS device, you need to back it up to your iCloud account. To do this, open the app then tap the gear icon in the bottom right corner to access Settings then tap the Chats option for the chat settings tab.Next, tap the Chat Backup option and tap Back Up Now to create a manual backup.Once your backup is finished, go to your home screen and long press on the WhatsApp icon.Afterward, you’ll see a pop-up menu next to the WhatsApp icon, tap Remove App, then tap Delete App from the confirmation message to completely remove the app from your iPhone.That’s how to easily remove, and in essence, sign out of WhatsApp on your iPhone.

## Log Out Of WhatsApp Web Via Browser
 
WhatsApp Web is the browser version of WhatsApp. It allows you to use WhatsApp Desktop on any computer without your android smartphone or iOs device.

Here’s how to log out of WhatsApp Web on your computer:

If you logged into WhatsApp Web on someone else’s computer and forgot to log out, don’t fret, you can easily log out of it using the Linked Devices feature on the WhatsApp app. This method works for WhatsApp Desktop, as well.

### Can You Sign Out Of WhatsApp On iPhone?
 
Presently, you cannot sign out of WhatsApp on iPhone. You cannot do it on iPad either. If you want to sign out of WhatsApp on an iOS device, you’re going to have to delete the WhatsApp app altogether. You can do this from the home screen or via Settings.
 
### Does WhatsApp Web Logout Automatically?
 
WhatsApp Web does logout automatically. This happens after 30 minutes of inactivity. However, you can check a box under the QR code that says “keep me signed in” to stay signed in even after 30 minutes of inactivity. That way, you can log in whenever you wish, instead of automatically.
