This article explains how to install Node JS on Windows 11, 10, and 8.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Download Node JS and run the installer. Choose a directory and which components to install, then select Next. When it asks to install tools for Node JS, check the box for Automatically install the necessary tools.To open a Node console window, go to the Start menu > Node.js.

 
##   How to Install Node JS on Windows PCs  
 

Even though Node JS, like many web languages, tends to be easier to work with on Mac and Linux, that doesn’t mean Windows users are stuck without it. You can still easily get Node JS running on your Windows PC.

 
- Open your browser, then head over to the Node JS download page.
 - Select the Windows Installer, and begin your download.
 - When the download’s complete, run the installer.
 - The install wizard will open and greet you. Select Next to continue.
 - Next, you’ll be asked to accept the Node JS license. Read and accept the license and then select Next to keep moving.
 - The next screen will ask you to choose an installation directory for Node JS. The default option in your Program Files directory will work in most cases, but if you want something custom, select Change and navigate to the location you prefer. When you're done, select Next.
 - You’ll then have an opportunity to change the Node JS setup and choose which components you install. Unless you need something custom, leave this alone, then select Next.
 - The installer will then ask if you want to install the tools to build modules for Node JS. Select the box for Automatically install the necessary tools, then select Next.
 - Because Node isn’t generally intended to run on Windows, it’s a good idea to install these modules for the absolute best possible compatibility now, rather than having to go back later and fill in gaps.
 - With the setup complete, you’ll be presented with the option to begin the installation. Select Install to start.
 - The installation will run. It should only take a few seconds to run through. When it’s done, you’ll see a success message letting you know that Node JS was installed. Select Finish to complete the install.
 - A command line window will now appear and ask you to install the additional modules. Press any key to start.
 - A PowerShell window will launch to begin the installation. Confirm anything that it asks. This process will install several components and modules from multiple locations, so it may take some time.
 - Finally, the install will complete and the PowerShell window will close. You’re officially ready to work with Node.
 - Open the Start menu, scroll and select the Node.js folder to expand the entry, then select Node.js.
 - A Node console window will open. Here you can test out Node. You can type any JavaScript code in the console, and Node will run it. It’s simplest to test with:
 - console.log(“something”);
 - That’s it! You’re ready to start developing with Node JS on your Windows PC.
