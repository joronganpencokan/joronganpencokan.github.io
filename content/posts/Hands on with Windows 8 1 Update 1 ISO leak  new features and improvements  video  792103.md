# You won't believe the game-changing upgrades in the Windows 8.1 Update 1 ISO leak - see it for yourself in this mind-blowing hands-on video!

The long-awaited Update 1 for Windows 8.1 has finally been leaked in ISO form, and the rumors are true - it brings a range of game-changing upgrades to the popular operating system. With a focus on improving the user experience and functionality, Update 1 introduces a number of features that Windows users have been clamoring for.

Thanks to a hands-on video that has surfaced online, you can now see these new features in action for yourself. From improved mouse and keyboard support to better multitasking, the updates are sure to make Windows 8.1 even more popular than it already is.

So, what are some of the standout features that we can expect from Update 1? Let's take a closer look:

## Enhanced Search Functionality

One of the biggest complaints about Windows 8.1 has been the difficulty in finding files and apps. With Update 1, Microsoft has addressed this issue by making search more intuitive, smarter, and more consistent. The new search bar on the Start screen is a major improvement, providing users with easier access to search results and making it much simpler to find what they're looking for.

## Start Screen Customization

Speaking of the Start screen, Update 1 also brings improved tile customization options, including the ability to pin both desktop and universal apps to the Start screen. This makes it easier to access your favorite apps and programs from a single location, and gives you more control over the appearance and functionality of your device.

## Mouse and Keyboard Support

Windows 8.1 has always been designed with touchscreens in mind, which has left users with traditional mice and keyboards feeling left out. With Update 1, Microsoft has focused on improving mouse and keyboard support. There are new right-click context menus on the Start screen and in the Taskbar, and there are more options for desktop apps when using touchpads.

## Improved Multitasking

Multitasking is easier than ever with Update 1, thanks to the ability to pin apps to the taskbar and access them with a single click. Users can also snap up to four apps side by side on the screen, making it possible to work on multiple tasks simultaneously.

## A More Streamlined Experience

Finally, Update 1 brings a range of smaller tweaks and improvements that make using Windows 8.1 a more streamlined experience. This includes the ability to shut down or restart your PC from the Start screen, an overall increase in system stability, and a more seamless transition between the desktop and Start screen modes.

After watching the hands-on video of Update 1, it's clear that Microsoft has listened to the feedback of its users and made some significant improvements to Windows 8.1. Whether you're a fan of the operating system or not, these upgrades are sure to make your experience with it even more efficient, intuitive, and enjoyable.
