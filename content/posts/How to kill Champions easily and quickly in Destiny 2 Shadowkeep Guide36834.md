Introduction
Destiny 2 Shadowkeep Champions can be annoying and difficult to beat, but with the right method and approach, you can take them down with ease. In this article, we'll cover tips on how to unleash your inner guardian and master the art of Shadowkeep Champion Defeating.

Step One: Identify the Champion
The first step to take down any Champion is to figure out what kind of Champion it is. There are three types of Champions in Shadowkeep: Barrier, Unstoppable, and Overload. Each of them requires a different strategy in order to defeat them. 

Barrier Champions - These champions put up a shield that blocks incoming damage. In order to take them down, you need to quickly destroy their shield. Once it's down, you can unleash your weapons and do damage. To destroy their barrier, use Anti-Barrier Rounds or a weapon that has the Armor-Piercing Rounds perk.

Overload Champions - These champions can heal themselves and become invulnerable for a short time, making them hard to defeat. To take them down, you need to overload their healing ability. Equip weapons with the Overload Rounds perk, or use abilities like Arc Grenades or Arc Staff, to inflict huge amounts of damage and take them down.

Unstoppable Champions - These champions have a strong shield ability that makes them immune to all incoming damage. To bring them down, you need to stagger them. Use weapons with the Unstoppable Rounds perk or use abilities like the Void Grenade to stagger them and inflict damage.

Step Two: Use The Right Weapons And Mods
The second step to defeating Shadowkeep Champions is to use the right weapons and mods. Equip weapons with the correct mods to make them more effective at taking down Champions. 

Anti-Barrier Rounds - As previously mentioned, Anti-Barrier Rounds can penetrate armor and destroy a Barrier Champion's shield.

Overload Rounds - Overload rounds can interrupt an Overload champion's healing ability.

Unstoppable Rounds - Unstoppable Rounds can stagger an Unstoppable Champion, making them more open to attacks.

Step Three: Use Super And Abilities
Most players overlook super and abilities when trying to take down Shadowkeep Champions, but with the right approach, they can help you defeat them with ease. 

Arc Grenades - Arc grenades can overload an Overload Champion, making them more vulnerable to attacks.

Void Grenade - A Void Grenade can stagger an Unstoppable Champion, allowing you to inflict damage.

Arc Staff - The Arc Staff can also overload an Overload Champion.

Step Four: Team up with Other Guardians
Team up with other Guardians to increase your chances of defeating Shadowkeep Champions. A team of guardians can coordinate better and take down Champions quicker using different abilities and approaches. 

Conclusion
In conclusion, Shadowkeep Champions may seem intimidating, but with the right approach, you can take them down with ease. By identifying the Champion, using the right weapons and mods, using Super and Abilities, and teaming up with other Guardians, you can become a master of Shadowkeep Champion Defeating. So, go out there, Guardian, and unleash your inner strength!

Destiny 2 Shadowkeep not only brings new weapons and quests for players but this time around players got a new class of enemies, titled the Champions in Destiny 2. These Champions are extremely powerful enemies and you will require a lot of coordination to stop them. This guide will show you the best method for how to kill Champions in Destiny 2 Shadowkeep.
 
## How to kill Champions easily and quickly in Destiny 2 Shadowkeep
 
First, to kill a Champion easily and quickly you need to understand what type of Champion you are up against, there are three types the Barrier, Overload, and Unstoppable Champions that you can find in Destiny 2 Shadowkeep.
 
Before you take on a Champion and engage in a fight you will need to equip yourself with some of the new mods that have been made available in Destiny 2 Shadowkeep.
 
The new mods are accompanied by the Gate Lord’s Eye Seasonal Artifact. The three mods that are essential to kill a Champion give the weapon a much-needed effect and those are Anti-Barrier Rounds, Overload Rounds, and Unstoppable Rounds.
 
These mods and their effects if used properly will let you take down a Champion in no time.
 
### Barrier Champions
 
A Barrier Champion will protect himself from enemies with a shield, now normally shooting it would work but for this Champion, you will require the Anti-Barrier Rounds Mod. Make sure that you have a weapon around that can equip this mod so that you can start inflicting some damage.
 
Only weapons that can use the Anti-Barrier Rounds Mods are Auto Rifles, Submachine Guns, and Hand Cannons. Once the Champions has its shield up, equip this mod and it will inflict massive damage to the shield.
 
In our opinion, the Recluse is probably the best weapon to use for the Anti-Barrier Mod.
 
### Overload Champions
 
Overload Champions are almost invincible, they are extremely powerful and will be immune to most firepower unless you have the Overload Rounds mod. This mod will quickly turn your weapon into something extraordinary in an instant.
 
You cannot attack an Overload Champion without the Overload Rounds Mod, once attached, they will overload the champion and this, in turn, stuns them and makes them vulnerable for normal weapon fire.
 
You can repeat the above method to kill an Overload Champion.
 
### Unstoppable Champions
 
Like the Overload Champions, the Unstoppable Champions too are difficult to take down, and you will require specific weapon mod to take them down. The Unstoppable mod can only be used with a hand cannon.
 
Unlike other mods and bosses though, the Unstoppable mod works a bit different, you will always require to aim your sights down and wait until the gun starts glowing. Only when the message pops up on the screen saying “you’ve loaded an unstoppable round” can you inflict damage to the Unstoppable Champions.
 
However, you can only fire one Unstoppable Round at a time so make sure that you plan your attacks well.
 
The new Champions introduced to Destiny 2 in Shadowkeep are challenging and it is a great bit fun, make sure to use the correct mod to the correct Champion and you will start taking them down in no time.
