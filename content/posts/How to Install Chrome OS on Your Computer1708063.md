Have you ever wanted to try out the Chrome OS on your PC but didn't want to invest in a new device? Well, you don't have to! In this article, we'll guide you step-by-step on how to transform your PC into a Chromebook using a simple trick. 

Firstly, let's discuss what a Chromebook is. A Chromebook is a laptop or tablet that runs on Google's Chrome OS, which is a lightweight operating system designed for browsing the internet and running web applications. It also has a built-in virus protection system and automatic updates, making it an excellent option for those who prioritize security and simplicity.

To transform your PC into a Chromebook, you'll need a lightweight operating system called CloudReady. CloudReady is a free open-source operating system based on Chromium OS, the same open-source project that powers Chrome OS. 

Let's get started on transforming your PC into a Chromebook using CloudReady. 

Step 1: Download and Install CloudReady

Firstly, you'll need to download the CloudReady Home Edition installer from their official website. The Home Edition is free for individual use and compatible with most modern PCs and Macs. 

Once downloaded, create a bootable USB drive using the CloudReady installer. Connect the USB drive to your PC and restart your computer to boot into the CloudReady installer. 

Step 2: Install CloudReady on Your PC

Follow the on-screen instructions to install CloudReady on your PC. Make sure to select the option to erase your hard disk and install CloudReady as the only operating system. 

Once the installation is complete, your PC will restart, and you'll be greeted with the CloudReady login screen. 

Step 3: Enjoy Your Newly Transformed Chromebook PC

Congratulations! You've transformed your PC into a Chromebook using CloudReady. 

CloudReady comes with all the features and benefits of Chrome OS, including automatic updates, built-in virus protection, and access to the extensive Chrome Web Store. You can also install Android apps on your new "Chromebook" using the Google Play Store, making it even more versatile. 

In conclusion, transforming your PC into a Chromebook using CloudReady is easy, affordable, and a great way to try out a new operating system on your device. You can try out this simple trick without the need for purchasing new hardware. So, what are you waiting for? Give CloudReady a try, and enjoy the benefits of Chrome OS on your PC.

##   How to Create a CloudReady Chromium OS Installer on a USB Drive  
 

This process is a little different on Windows than it is on MacOS and Chrome OS, and Neverware recommends that you use Windows for this step even if you aren't planning on installing CloudReady on a Windows computer.

 

If you have access to a Windows computer, the first step is to download the CloudReady USB maker from Neverware:

 
- Navigate to Neverware.com.
 - Scroll down to Get the Free Version and select it.
 - Select Install the Home Edition.
 - Select Download USB Maker.

 

Once you have downloaded the USB maker, you're ready to create the USB installer. You will need an 8 or 16GB USB stick for this step. You will lose any data that's stored on the USB stick, so back it up before you create your USB installer.

 

Navigate to Neverware.com.

 

Scroll down to Get the Free Version and select it.

 

Select Install the Home Edition.

 

Select Download USB Maker.

 

Here's how to create a USB installer for CloudReady:

 
Neverware recommends that you don't use SanDisk USB sticks, but if that's all you have, it should work.
 
- Launch the CloudReady USB maker program that you downloaded from Neverware.
 - Click or tap Next.
 - Select 64-bit or 32-bit, and click or tap Next.
 - If you're unsure, here's how to tell if your Windows computer is 64- or 32-bit.
 - Insert your USB stick and click or tap Next.
 - Do not proceed if you have any important data on your USB stick. Back up any important data first.
 - Select the USB stick that you want to use, and click or tap Next.
 - Wait for the installation to complete, and click or tap Finish.
 - Once you have finished making your CloudReady USB stick, you're ready to try it out.

 
##   What If You Only Have a Mac or Chromebook?  
 

If you don't have a Windows computer, you can still make a CloudReady USB installer. The process is a little more complicated, and Neverware recommends you use Windows instead, but it is possible.

 

Launch the CloudReady USB maker program that you downloaded from Neverware.

If you insert the USB stick in your computer, and it boots to its normal operating system, you will need to change the boot order. Check out our guide to changing boot order in BIOS if you are unsure how to accomplish this. On a Mac, just hold down the option key when booting up and you'll be given a choice of which device to use to boot your Mac.

 

Here's how to run Chromium OS from a USB stick via CloudReady:

 
- Select a computer that you want to use with CloudReady.
 - You can use a laptop, desktop, Windows, Mac, or even Linux computer. The hardware may not be perfectly compatible, but you won't know until you try.
 - Make sure the computer is off.
 - Locate a USB port on the computer and insert your CloudReady installation USB.
 - Turn the computer on.
 - If it boots to its normal operating system, you will need to change the boot order.
 - Wait for the welcome screen to appear.
 - Click Let's go.
 - Check your internet connection.
 - If you aren't connected to ethernet, plug in an ethernet cable, or click Add other Wi-Fi network.
 - If adding a Wi-Fi network, click on your network, or enter the SSID and click Connect. Skip this step if you are connected via ethernet.
 - Click Next > CONTINUE.
 - Enter your Gmail address or email that's associated with your Google account, and click Next.
 - If you don't already have a Google account, click More options and follow the on-screen instructions.

###   Optional: Run CloudReady From USB Without Permanently Installing It  
 

If you don't want to permanently replace your existing operating system with CloudReady, you can simply leave the USB stick in your computer. Every time you turn it on, it will boot to CloudReady instead of the original operating system. If you ever want to use the original operating system, just turn off the computer, remove the USB stick, and turn the computer back on.

 

Before you install CloudReady permanently, you will need to back up all of your files to the cloud or an external hard drive. You should then boot up CloudReady using the method that was described in the previous section.

 
If you don't install CloudReady permanently, you will not receive updates. CloudReady receives regular, automatic updates from Neverware once it has been installed. You will need to periodically create a new CloudReady USB stick to take advantage of updates to the operating system if you choose to not permanently install it.
 
Installing CloudReady deletes your original operating system and all of the files on your computer. After you install it, your computer will have a version of Chromium OS on it instead of the original operating system. The rest of the data on the computer, including any images or videos you have saved, will also be gone.
 

If your computer doesn't operate normally when running CloudReady from the USB installer, permanently installing CloudReady won't magically fix the problem. Make sure that all of your devices, including the keyboard, mouse or touchpad, Wi-Fi, and everything else functions normally.

 

CloudReady is compatible with most computers, but some hardware just isn't compatible with ChromeOS or CloudReady. If you find that your computer won't connect to Wi-Fi, CloudReady probably doesn't have a working driver for your Wi-Fi card. In that case, permanently installing CloudReady would be a bad idea.

 

If CloudReady works well on your computer, installing it is extremely easy:

 
- Turn your computer on with the CloudReady USB stick already inserted.
 - Wait for CloudReady to boot up.
 - Click your user icon in the lower right corner of the system tray.
 - Click Install CloudReady > INSTALL CLOUDREADY.
 - Read and agree to all warnings, and wait for the installation process to finish.
 - Once the installation process has finished, you can turn the computer off and remove the USB stick. When you turn the computer on the next time, it will boot into CloudReady.

 
##   Chrome OS vs. Chromium OS  
 

Chrome OS is based on Chromium OS. Chromium OS is an open-source project that anyone (really) can copy, modify, and use in any way they like. That means you could get pretty close to a Chrome OS experience by installing Chromium OS on a computer. It does take some rather technical expertise, however.

 

Turn your computer on with the CloudReady USB stick already inserted.

 

Wait for CloudReady to boot up.

 

Click your user icon in the lower right corner of the system tray.

 

Click Install CloudReady > INSTALL CLOUDREADY.

 

Read and agree to all warnings, and wait for the installation process to finish.

 

Once the installation process has finished, you can turn the computer off and remove the USB stick. When you turn the computer on the next time, it will boot into CloudReady.

 
##   What Is CloudReady?  
 

CloudReady is an operating system that is based on Chromium OS, just like Google's official Chrome OS. Both Neverware and Google take the base code from the Chromium OS open source project and add their own proprietary code to create a working operating system.

 

The advantage of CloudReady, in comparison to Chrome OS, is that you can install it on a wide variety of hardware. If you have an old Windows laptop or MacBook that has slowed down over time, you may be able to turn it into a very close approximation of a Chromebook by installing CloudReady.

 

Because CloudReady isn't as resource-intensive as modern versions of Windows and MacOS, you may see a performance improvement if you install it on an older computer or laptop.

 
CloudReady isn't compatible with all computer hardware. Before you install it on your computer, boot it from a USB drive and make sure that your mouse or touchpad, keyboard, Wi-Fi, and other devices work.
