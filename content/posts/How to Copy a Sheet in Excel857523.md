Introduction:
Excel sheets are a vital part of every business, and most of our work revolves around them. It can be a frustrating task when we have to create multiple sheets with similar formulas, formats, and data. It is tedious and time-consuming, but what if there was a way to duplicate Excel sheets easily? In this article, we will unlock the secret of effortlessly duplicating Excel sheets and change our spreadsheet lives forever.

The simplest way to duplicate an Excel sheet is by using the "Move or Copy Sheet" feature. Follow these steps to duplicate a sheet:

1. Right-click on the sheet you want to duplicate.

3. In the "To Book" section of the "Move or Copy Sheet" dialog box, choose "New book" from the list.

This process will create an identical copy of your sheet in a new workbook. You can also choose to duplicate the sheet within the same workbook by selecting a different worksheet from the "To Book" section.

1. Right-click on the sheet you want to duplicate
2. Hold down the "Ctrl" key and drag the sheet's tab to the right or left within the workbook.
3. Release the mouse button and the "Ctrl" key.

This process will create a duplicate sheet with the same data, formulas, and formatting as the original sheet.

Lastly, you can use a VBA macro to create a duplicate sheet. To do this, press" Alt + F11" to open the VBA editor and follow these steps:

1. Select the workbook in the left pane of the VBA editor.
2. Click the "Insert" drop-down menu and select "Module" to create a new module.
3. In the new module's window, paste the following code:

Sub CopySheet()
  Dim ws As Worksheet
  Set ws = ActiveSheet
  ws.Copy After:=ws
End Sub

4. Press "F5" to run the code and create a duplicate sheet.
