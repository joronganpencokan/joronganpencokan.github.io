If you are a fan of high-quality video content and have a 4K television at home, you have likely heard the term HDR10. HDR10, which stands for High Dynamic Range 10, is a technology that is revolutionizing the entertainment industry by providing viewers with an unparalleled viewing experience. With HDR10, you can enjoy richer, more vibrant colors, sharper contrast, and a greater level of detail in every scene.

But what exactly is HDR10, and how does it work? HDR10 refers to a set of technical specifications that allow content creators to expand the range of colors and contrast that are displayed on your TV screen. Instead of the traditional 8 bits of color per channel that are used in standard dynamic range (SDR) content, HDR10 uses 10 bits per channel. This means that there are billions more colors available to display on your screen, resulting in a much more realistic and immersive image.

HDR10 also enables a higher level of contrast between the brightest and darkest areas of an image. In SDR content, the brightest areas are often "clipped," or cut off, meaning that any detail in those areas is lost. With HDR10, the brightest areas of an image can be displayed without clipping, allowing for a more true-to-life representation of the scene.

So, why is HDR10 such a game-changer? Simply put, it provides viewers with a viewing experience that is closer to what the human eye can see in the real world. HDR10 content looks more vibrant, more lifelike, and more engaging than ever before. Whether you are watching a blockbuster movie, a nature documentary, or a live sports event, HDR10 can take your viewing experience to the next level.

But it's not just about the technical specifications. What really sets HDR10 apart is the creativity that it enables content creators to bring to the screen. With HDR10, filmmakers and television producers have more tools at their disposal to tell their stories and create immersive, visually stunning content. HDR10 allows for creative choices in color and contrast that were simply not possible before, meaning that viewers can experience content in a way that was previously only possible in their imagination.

In conclusion, HDR10 is a game-changing technology that is revolutionizing the entertainment industry by providing viewers with an unmatched viewing experience. By expanding the range of colors and contrast that can be displayed on your screen, HDR10 allows you to enjoy content in a way that is closer to what the human eye sees in the real world. So, the next time you are looking for a high-quality viewing experience, make sure to seek out HDR10 content – it will leave you breathless!

If you’ve purchased a new TV recently or follow the industry in any capacity, you’ve probably come across the term HDR10+.

 

This article will help you understand how HDR10+ works and how it differs from other HDR standards.

 
##   What Is HDR10+?  
 

Before getting into HDR10+, it’s essential to understand what HDR is.

 

High-dynamic-range (HDR) is a video technology used in the high-definition television industry to produce video and still images with improved brightness, contrast, and color accuracy. Any HDR-capable TV is compatible with one or more HDR formats.

 

HDR10 is the most widely adopted format and is an open, royalty-free standard that uses static metadata to deliver brightness, contrast, and color to your TV. Since static metadata bases its tone mapping on the brightest frame in the content (a movie, for instance), HDR10 can deliver a disappointing viewing experience on less capable HDR TVs.

 

By contrast, HDR formats like Dolby Vision and HDR10+ use dynamic metadata, which adjusts tone mapping on a scene-by-scene basis, significantly improving the overall viewing experience. Dolby Vision and HDR10+ are competing HDR formats, each with its pros and cons.

 

Dolby Vision is slightly more powerful thanks to its 12-bit color depth (compared to HDR10+’s 10-bit color) and is currently supported by a wider array of TV makers and content platforms. However, HDR10+ has the advantage of being an open standard; meaning content makers don’t need to pay a licensing fee to use it like they do with Dolby Vision. 

 
##   Is HDR10+ Better Than HDR?  
 

HDR10+ is essentially a delivery method for HDR rather than a competing technology. The more important question is whether HDR10+ is better than HDR10, to which the answer is yes — at least in terms of overall quality. HDR10 is still considered the default HDR format due to its near-universal adoption. But as covered above, its use of static metadata makes it a less than ideal format. 

 

HDR10+ delivers the same brightness level (maximum of 4,000 cd/m²) as HDR10, but its use of dynamic metadata provides enhanced HDR images. As more TV makers and content platforms adopt it, HDR10+ will likely replace HDR10 as the default HDR format.

 
HDR10 is supported by all HDR-compatible TVs, home theater receivers, Ultra HD Blu-ray players, and select media streamers.
 
##   Is HDR10+ Better Than Dolby Vision?  
 

It’s easy to get the impression that the presence of HDR10+ and Dolby Vision is akin to the format war we saw between Blu-ray and HD-DVD in the mid-2000s. However, this rivalry is much more consumer-friendly as TV and content makers can support multiple HDR formats simultaneously. But just because HDR formats aren’t mutually exclusive doesn’t mean there aren’t notable differences between them.

 

Although HDR10+ has the advantage of being royalty-free, Dolby Vision is generally regarded as the better format due to its improved brightness and color. That said, you’ll get incredible picture quality from either one.

 
##   What Equipment Do I Need to Get HDR10+?  
 

To take full advantage of HDR10+, you’ll need the following equipment:

 
##   What Is the Difference Between 4K and HDR10+?  
 

Although both 4K and HDR improve image quality, they do so differently and are not competitors.

 

4K refers to screen resolution, corresponding to the number of pixels that fit on a TV screen or display. Used synonymously with Ultra HD (UHD), 4K represents a horizontal screen resolution of approximately 4,000 pixels.

 

As outlined above, HDR refers to contrast and color range on a TV screen or display. An HDR image has a higher contrast and brightness range than Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) and is frequently combined with a 4K resolution to deliver striking picture quality.

 
##   Is HDR10+ the Future of the Format?  
 

It isn't easy to know for sure what the future holds for HDR10+ and HDR formats as a whole. Although there's a good chance HDR10+ will become the de facto standard format, Dolby Vision isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

 

The good news is since it's relatively easy for TV manufacturers and content producers to support multiple HDR formats, you don't need to choose between HDR10+ and Dolby Vision. Aim to buy a TV that supports both formats if you can, but you should be fine as long you have HDR-compatible equipment in the first place.

 
- What is HDR10 for gaming?
 - HDR10 for gaming requires games, consoles, and TVs that support the HDR10 format. HDR gaming usually requires turning on the HDR setting on your gaming console and compatible TV (if the setting isn't on by default). Learn more from our guide to setting up HDR gaming on a PS4.
