So, if you were planning to play with your friends on different platforms, it will not be possible. You can only play with those who are on the same platform as you. In case you play the game on PC, you won’t be able to play with console players. You can only join other PC players. It seems that crossplay won’t be added to the game in the future too so it’s best we don’t keep our hopes up.
