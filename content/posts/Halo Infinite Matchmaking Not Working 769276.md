Matchmaking Glitch:
The matchmaking glitch that has caused chaos in online play is related to inconsistent skill-based matchmaking.

In the meantime, the developers have advised players to avoid crossplay and turn off the game's multiplayer mode until a permanent fix is found. They have also assured fans that they are listening to feedback and working hard to improve the game's stability and performance.

Conclusion:

This is what you can do from your end to possibly fix it.
 
## Halo Infinite Matchmaking Not Working Fixes
 

 
If matchmaking is not working in Halo Infinite, this is what you need to check.
 
### Check your Internet Connection
 
Let’s get the most obvious one out of the way. It’s crucial that your internet speed is fast and if it’s unstable, turn off the router, restart it and try to join the matchmaking queue again. Check with your ISP regarding any connection issues and if it’s related to your speed, make sure to increase it.
 
### Restart the Game
 
The solution that’s tried and tested and may work well in this case also – simply shut down the game and relaunch it. Any issues that may have built up while playing will get flushed out and you can start over.
 
### Check the Halo Infinite server status
 
It’s a new title from an established series that has players, new and old, excited to try it out. With so many players flocking to the game, the servers can easily get overloaded and go down. This is how you can check if Halo Infinite servers are down or they are back up online. Due to server issues, players may face connection issues while trying to join the matchmaking queue.
 
### Matchmaking Glitch
 
Sometimes, the matchmaking system simply glitches. These are part of the problems that every online game has to face someday in their life cycle. If you are getting a glitch where the game gets you nowhere and keeps loading/freezes, close Halo Infinite and relaunch it.
