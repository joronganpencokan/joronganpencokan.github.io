# Unlock 7 Insane Minecraft Bed Tricks You Need to Try NOW!

As one of the most popular games in the world today, Minecraft continues to amaze gamers with its infinite possibilities. From building amazing structures to creating custom mods, Minecraft has something for everyone. However, one feature in the game that is often overlooked is the bed. Yes, the humble bed that we use to sleep in Minecraft has hidden potential that most players haven't yet discovered.

In this article, we'll share seven insane Minecraft bed tricks that you need to try now. So, letâ€™s get started.

## 1. Skip The Nighttime

Tired of waiting for the sun to rise in Minecraft? Well, you can skip the night altogether by using a bed. Simply place a bed and sleep in it, and the game will fast forward to the next morning. This trick is especially useful if you're playing in survival mode and need to avoid hostile mobs.

## 2. Cancel Your Fall Damage

Are you tired of taking damage when you fall from high places in Minecraft? Then, this trick is for you. If you place a bed at the bottom of your fall, you will negate the fall damage. Yes, you heard that right. Just make sure that the bed is placed on a block that is at least two blocks high.

## 3. Use Beds as Trampolines

Another interesting idea for beds in Minecraft is to use them as trampolines. You can do this by placing a bed on top of a high position and jumping on it. You will bounce back up much higher than before. Just make sure that the bed doesn't break from the impact.

## 4. Create Custom Spawns

Did you know you can create custom spawn points in Minecraft? This trick is especially useful if you want to return to a specific location in the game. To do this, simply place a bed where you want your new spawn point to be, and sleep in it. The next time you die, you'll spawn back at that location.

## 5. Use Beds as Doors

While beds aren't technically doors, they can be used as one in Minecraft. Simply place a bed in front of a door, and it will act as a temporary entrance until you can find or craft a proper door.

## 6. Travel Across the World Quickly

Minecraft is a vast world, and traversing it can take a lot of time. But, you can reduce your traveling time by using beds. If you place a bed at a remote location, you can sleep in it to reset your spawn point. Then, if you die or need to go back to that location, you can easily travel to it by killing yourself and spawning at that bed.

## 7. Create Hidden Storage

Finally, you can also use beds as hidden storage containers in Minecraft. To do this, place a bed in a location where you want to hide something. Then, place a block on top of the bed to hide it from view. You can then use the bed as a chest, and nobody will know it's there.

Conclusion:

These Minecraft bed tricks are just a few examples of the possibilities that exist in the game. With a little creativity, there's so much that you can do with this seemingly simple feature of the game. So, go ahead and try out these seven tips to unlock the full potential of Minecraft's beds. Happy gaming!
