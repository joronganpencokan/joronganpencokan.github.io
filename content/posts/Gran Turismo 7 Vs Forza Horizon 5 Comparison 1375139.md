When it comes to racing games, two of the biggest names in the industry are Gran Turismo and Forza Horizon. With the release of Gran Turismo 7 and Forza Horizon 5, both games offer exciting gameplay, stunning graphics, and an excellent selection of cars. But when it comes to the ultimate showdown between Gran Turismo 7 and Forza Horizon 5, who comes out on top?

Let's start with Gran Turismo 7. Developed by Polyphony Digital, Gran Turismo 7 has been highly anticipated since its announcement in 2019. With a focus on realism, Gran Turismo 7 offers an incredibly immersive experience. The game boasts an extensive selection of cars and tracks, including iconic circuits like the Nürburgring and Bathurst. The game also features a new campaign mode, where players can progress through different racing classes and compete in a variety of challenges.

On the other hand, Forza Horizon 5, developed by Playground Games, takes a different approach. Unlike Gran Turismo 7's realism, Forza Horizon 5 focuses on the fun, laid-back side of racing. The game is set in a vast open world, featuring stunning locations and dynamic weather. The game also boasts a wide variety of cars, with everything from classic muscle cars to modern supercars. The game also features a new campaign mode, where players progress through different racing events and earn rewards.

Now, onto the ultimate showdown - which game is better?

Both games excel in their respective areas, making it impossible to declare one game better than the other. Gran Turismo 7 offers a brilliant racing experience, with attention to detail that allows players to fully immerse themselves in the game. The selection of cars and tracks is fantastic, and the campaign mode offers a real sense of progression. On the other hand, Forza Horizon 5 offers a fun and thrilling racing experience, with a wide variety of cars and locations to explore. The open-world gameplay allows players to create their own adventures, and the campaign mode offers a sense of accomplishment.

In the end, it really comes down to personal preference. If you're looking for a realistic and immersive racing experience, Gran Turismo 7 is the game for you. But if you're looking for a fun and exciting game that allows you to explore a vast open world, Forza Horizon 5 is the perfect choice. Regardless of which game you choose, both Gran Turismo 7 and Forza Horizon 5 are excellent racing games that offer endless hours of entertainment.

This Winter Season has brought a lot of hype to the Racing Community in the forms of Gran Turismo 7 & Forza Horizon 5. Forza Horizon 5 was released on November 14th by Xbox. The game is open-world based in Mexico where the players can drive virtually anywhere. Gran Turismo 7 is a sim-racing game where all of the races are entirely based on race circuits. Along with these circuits, the players have carefully controlled their cars with intricate controls. Both games are stunning in their own right but which one is better? In this guide, I will be discussing which game will be the best one for you, Gran Turismo 7 Vs Forza Horizon 5.
 
## Gran Turismo 7 Vs Forza Horizon 5
 
Both Gran Turismo 7 & Forza Horizon 5 are Racing games so they will share a lot of similarities. Despite that, these games play out differently. Below are some of the points that differentiate the two games.
 
### Gameplay & Graphics
 

 
Both games, Gran Turismo 7 & Forza Horizon 5, are based on two very distinct styles of racing. Forza Horizon 5 is an open-world game where the players are free to drive wherever they choose so, on-road or off-road. However, Gran Turismo 7 is centered around proper race circuits that you see in professional sports. Saying this, both are very good in their own right. If you are a casual gamer then Forza Horizon 5 is more for you as the game is pretty laid back and you can focus only on the race. If you want a more competitive experience then Gran Turismo 7 is your game. Not only do you have to focus on the race but you’re required to constantly adjust your speeds.
 
Graphics is a major factor in players’ decision-making as only a beautiful game is worth playing. Although I don’t conform to it it is a preference for many. If I have to speak about the Level of Graphics for Gran Turismo 7 & Forza Horizon 5, then I would say that both have top-notch Quality. Forza Horizon 5 has bright & stunning visuals that are eye-catching where you will be able to experience every shade of color. Gran Turismo 7 is not as colorful but has some very realistic graphics that pretty much can become VR.
 
There is a point to be made as Forza Horizon 5 may have an edge on Gran Turismo 7 in this department just based on well they have used colors in the game. Another feature that is present in Forza is the Rewind system. In simple terms, it will Rewind you to a few positions back if you end up falling over a cliff. This allows players to make mistakes and then rectify them immediately. This is not there in Gran Turismo 7 as it is a competitive game that a more hardcore audience will enjoy.
 
The weather system in both games is amazing but Gran Turismo 7 has gone above & beyond. With its realistic weather and weather-related effects like wet roads or slippery roads due to snow, you will notice cars handling differently based on the weather.
 
### Cars: Gran Turismo 7 Vs Forza Horizon 5
 
### Handling the Vehicle
 
Coming back to the point of it being easier to drive in Forza Horizon 5 than it is in Gran Turismo 7. The Cars in Forza Horizon 5 are meant to be easier to drive as you tend to switch between in almost every race. Unlike in Gran Turismo 7, you get the Cars and then race to get them all in a pretty short amount of time. However, in Gran Turismo 7, you get one Car and learn everything about it. How it moves, how it turns, everything about it. You play more on a Car rather than a Set of Cars.
 
This again points back to the point of are you a casual player or a competitive player. But this is only a comparison between the two games. Both have realistic controls unlike most Racing games and you will need near-perfect hand-eye coordination to ace every race. If you have a Steering Wheel & a Gearbox, you can play both of these games with it instead of a mouse & Keyboard, or Controller.
 
### Sound Design: Gran Turismo 7 Vs Forza Horizon 5
 
Forza Horizon 5 & Gran Turismo 7 are modern-day games that have top-notch audio quality. Although Forza may have some amazing sound bites Gran Turismo wins this case. Gran Turismo 7 is meant to be more realistic and hence will lean towards sounds based on real Cars. If you want that adrenaline-pumping types sounds then Forza is going to be your pick. Saying that the realism Gran Turismo 7 brings to the table in terms of audio is on another level.
 
### Which Game should you choose?
 
Both Gran Turismo 7 & Forza Horizon 5 are amazing games. They both portray the Racing World from very different perspectives. If you want a more casual game and just want to have some fun then you should go with Forza Horizon 5. If you are a Gearhead and want a challenge then Gran Turismo 7 is your game. The choice also boils down to what Gaming System you have. If you have an Xbox or PC then you will be able to play Forza Horizon 5 while Gran Turismo 7 is a PS exclusive. Depending on what you have, you may have to go with that game. In any case, choosing one over the other doesn’t do justice to both of them. They are completely different and are equally as good.
