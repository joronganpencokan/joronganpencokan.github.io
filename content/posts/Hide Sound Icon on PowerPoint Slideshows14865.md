You've Been Using PowerPoint Wrong This Whole Time - Learn How to Hide Sound Icon On Your Slideshows Now!

PowerPoint has been the go-to tool for creating presentations for decades. However, many people, even those who have been using it for years, are unaware of some of its powerful features. One of these features is the ability to hide the sound icon on slideshows. In this article, we will show you how to hide the sound icon on your PowerPoint slideshows.

Why Hide the Sound Icon?

Before we dive into how to hide the sound icon on your PowerPoint presentations, it's essential to understand why you would want to do this. One of the most obvious reasons is aesthetics. The sound icon can be an eyesore that distracts from the presentation's content. Hiding the sound icon can make the slideshow appear more professional and polished.

Additionally, if you have been using PowerPoint for a while, you may have noticed that when you click on the sound icon, it produces a distracting sound. This can be particularly jarring if the sound is loud, and you are trying to present in a quieter room. Hiding the sound icon can eliminate this problem altogether.

How to Hide the Sound Icon

Hiding the sound icon on your PowerPoint slideshow is relatively simple. Follow the steps below to learn how:

1. Start by opening your PowerPoint presentation.

2. Click on the slide that contains the audio file you wish to hide.

3. Next, navigate to the "Insert" tab.

4. Click on "Audio" and select "Audio on My PC."

5. Select the audio file you want to hide.

6. Once you have the audio file selected, click on the "Playback" tab.

7. Locate and click on the "Hide During Show" checkbox.

8. Click "OK" to save your changes.

9. Finally, click "File" and "Save" to update your PowerPoint presentation.

And that's it! The sound icon will no longer appear on the slide during your PowerPoint presentation.

Conclusion

PowerPoint is a powerful tool that has been around for a long time. However, many people are unaware of some of its advanced features. Hiding the sound icon on your PowerPoint presentations can be a simple yet effective way to make your presentation more professional and polished. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can quickly and easily hide the sound icon on any slide in your presentation.
