Save Money and Stay Connected: Learn the Secret to Limiting App Data Usage on Your Android!

Introduction:
In this digital age, staying connected to the world has become an essential aspect of our daily lives. With the increasing number of applications on Android devices, it has become crucial to find a way to limit data usage to prevent unnecessary charges. Limiting data usage not only helps in saving money but also helps in staying connected to the world without any interruptions. In this article, we will uncover the secret to limiting app data usage on your Android device.

1. Turn off background data:
One of the most effective ways to limit app data usage on your Android device is to turn off background data. Background data is data that all apps use in the background to stay updated. However, it comes with a cost - data usage. Turning off background data can be done in a few simple steps. Head to the "Data Usage" tab in "Settings" and select the app that you want to restrict background data on. Then toggle the "Restrict background data" option to prevent the app from using data when it is running in the background.

2. Use Wi-Fi whenever possible:
Using Wi-Fi instead of mobile data whenever possible can be a great way to limit app data usage. Wi-Fi is faster and often free, making it a more cost-effective option. Make sure to connect to a trusted network to avoid any security issues.

3. Disable auto-updates:
Auto-updates can be convenient, but they consume a considerable amount of data. Disabling auto-updates can help in reducing app data usage. You can turn off auto-updates by going to the "Play Store" app and selecting "Settings." Then choose "Auto-update apps" and select "Don't auto-update apps."

4. Use data-saving apps:
Many apps are designed to help limit app data usage. Data-saving apps such as "Datally" and "My Data Manager" can help monitor data usage and limit app data usage to save money. These apps allow you to select which apps can consume data and which cannot.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, limiting app data usage on your Android device can help in saving money and staying connected to the world without any interruptions. By turning off background data, using Wi-Fi, disabling auto-updates, and using data-saving apps, you can significantly reduce app data usage and avoid unnecessary charges. Try out these tips and enjoy a seamless mobile experience without going over your data plan!

### Using NetPatch Firewall


Well, NetPatch is one of the leading firewall apps available on the Google Play Store. The great thing about NetPatch Firewall is that it can not only block internet usage of the specific app, but it also allows users to block domains to exchange internet traffic.
Another great thing about the NetPatch firewall is that it doesn’t need a rooted Android smartphone to work. So, let’s know how to use NetPatch Firewall to restrict Data Usage per-app basis on Android.
