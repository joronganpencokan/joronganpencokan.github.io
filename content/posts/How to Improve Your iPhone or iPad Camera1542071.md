# Discover the Secret Tricks to Taking Breathtaking Photos on Your iPhone or iPad!

Are you tired of taking mediocre photos with your iPhone or iPad? Do you want to capture stunning images that look like they were taken by a professional photographer? Then, you're in luck because, with a few simple tricks, you can take breathtaking photos that will leave your friends and family in awe.

Here are some secret tricks to taking amazing photos on your iPhone or iPad:

## 1. Clean your lens

The first and most important step to taking great photos on your iPhone or iPad is to clean your lens. Your camera lens can easily accumulate dust, dirt, or fingerprints, which can cause your photos to look blurry or hazy. Use a microfiber cloth or a lens cloth to clean your lens before taking any photos.

## 2. Use natural light

Lighting is one of the essential factors that determine the outcome of a photo. Using natural light is one of the best ways to get stunning photos. Find a spot where there is plenty of natural light, and position your subject accordingly. Try not to use the flash unless you have no alternative.

## 3. Adjust the exposure

Sometimes, when taking photos, the subject can be too bright or too dark. The iPhone and iPad have a built-in feature that allows you to adjust the exposure before you take a photo. To do this, tap on the subject on the screen, and then swipe up or down the vertical scale that pops up to increase or decrease the exposure.

## 4. Use the rule of thirds

The rule of thirds is a photography technique that involves dividing the frame into thirds, both horizontally and vertically. The idea is to place your subject on one of the intersecting points, rather than in the middle of the frame. This way, your photos will look more balanced and visually pleasing.

## 5. Get creative with angles

Don't be afraid to experiment with different angles when taking photos. Shooting from a different angle can completely change the visual perspective of a photo. Try shooting from a lower or higher angle, or even from a different position altogether. You never know what you might capture.

## 6. Edit your photos

The iPhone and iPad have an extensive range of built-in editing tools that can take your photos to the next level. You can adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation, and more, and even add filters to your photos. But try not to overdo it, as too much editing can make your photos look unnatural.

In conclusion, these simple tricks can help you take breathtaking photos on your iPhone or iPad. Remember to clean your lens, use natural light, adjust the exposure, use the rule of thirds, get creative with angles, and edit your photos. With a little effort, you'll be able to capture stunning photos that you'll be proud to share with the world.

The iPad camera gets better with each new model. Still, it isn't a full-featured camera capable of taking every shot. While the device's huge screen can make it easier to snap a fantastic photo, the camera lags behind the one found in the iPhone. To take advantage of your mobile device without sacrificing quality, improve your camera and the photos you take with these suggestions.

 
##   Improve Your Photos Through Settings  
 

Some newer iPads contain an Auto HDR or Smart HDR setting that you select to automatically take every photo with this feature. This setting tells the iPhone or iPad to snap multiple photos and merge them to create a high dynamic range (HDR) photograph. Turn Auto HDR or Smart HDR (depending on your iOS version) on or off in Settings > Camera.

 
Instructions in this article apply to iOS 12, iOS 11, iPadOS 14, and iPadOS 13.
 

In older iPads, there isn't an automatic setting for HDR. Instead, you manually turn on HDR in the Camera app when you want to use it.

 
- Open the Camera app.
 - Tap HDR.
 - When HDR is on, HDR appears at the top of the screen.
 - HDR automatically runs whenever you take a photo as long as HDR is displayed at the top of the screen. Use your camera as usual.

 
##   Edit Photos With the Camera App  
 

The Camera app has built-in filters that can bring out the best in an image. After snapping a photo, a small thumbnail of the picture appears to the right or below the large circular snap button, depending on if the iPad is in landscape or portrait mode. Tap this thumbnail to view the photo full-screen, then tap the Edit button in the upper-right corner.

 

Open the Camera app.

 

Tap HDR.

 

When HDR is on, HDR appears at the top of the screen.

 

HDR automatically runs whenever you take a photo as long as HDR is displayed at the top of the screen. Use your camera as usual.

 

Use the editing tools to make changes and enhance a photo. Depending on your iPad model, these tools all appear on the right side of the image or are split to appear on both sides of the image.

 
- The Magic Wand analyzes a photo and adjusts lighting and color contrast.
 - The Crop tool removes unwanted portions of a photo and can be used to rotate the image.
 - The Filters tools apply filters to a photo that change the brightness, saturation, and color contrast, which can have a dramatic effect on your photo. You can add third-party filters through the App Store.
 - The Dial tool gives you manual control over lighting and color.

 

When you finish making changes, tap Done to save the image.

 
##   Use Live Photos to Improve Your Photography  
 

Live Photos are small video clips the phone captures when you take a photograph on a newer iPhone or iPad. Along with creating moving pictures, you can choose a main photograph from the video to fix defects like an awkward facial expression, a blink of the eyes, or a just-missed shot.

 

Here's how to choose a new image from a Live Photo:

 
The Live Photos function is available on iPhones 6S and later and 9.7-inch iPad Pros and later, running iOS 9 or newer.
 
- Take a Live Photo or select one from the Photos app and then tap Edit in the upper-right corner of the screen.
 - When editing a Live Photo, the bottom of the screen shows every frame the camera captured. Tap individual slides to preview the image.
 - Tap Make Key Photo to choose a frame.
 - Tap Done to finalize your choice.

 
##   Buy an External Lens  
 

An external lens can do more than adjust the camera settings. It can increase magnification and take specialty shots such as wide-angle. A lens also boosts functionality on an older device by improving the camera without the extra cost of a new smartphone or tablet.

 

Take a Live Photo or select one from the Photos app and then tap Edit in the upper-right corner of the screen.

 

When editing a Live Photo, the bottom of the screen shows every frame the camera captured. Tap individual slides to preview the image.

 

Tap Make Key Photo to choose a frame.

 

Tap Done to finalize your choice.

 

A good source for camera peripherals for iPad and iPhone is iOgrapher. This company makes lenses that work with a specially designed case that supports different interchangeable lenses to get the perfect shot. You can use the same lenses for both iPad and iPhone as long as both devices have an iOgrapher case.
