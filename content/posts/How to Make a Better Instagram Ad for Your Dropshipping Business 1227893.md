Boost Your Dropshipping Business with This One Simple Trick for Killer Instagram Ads!

Instagram is one of the leading social media platforms for businesses to boost their online presence and attract new customers. If you are running a dropshipping business on Instagram, you are already ahead of the game. However, to truly take your business to the next level, you need to leverage the power of Instagram ads effectively. In this article, we will share with you one simple trick that will help you create killer Instagram ads and boost your dropshipping business.

The first thing you need to keep in mind when creating an Instagram ad is that the platform is all about visual content. That is why your ad needs to be visually appealing and communicate a clear message to your target audience. But with so many ads competing for attention, how can you stand out?

The answer is simple: use high-quality images.

High-quality images catch the eye, communicate professionalism, and help build brand trust. They can make your brand stand out among the vast sea of Instagram ads, and they are more likely to entice viewers to click on your ad, leading them to your product page.

So, how do you ensure you are using high-quality images for your Instagram ads?

Here are some tips:

1. Use professional images: This means avoiding stock images that look fake or generic. Instead, consider hiring a professional photographer to take product photos for you. If that is outside your budget, use a high-quality camera or smartphone to take photos that are sharp, well-lit, and in-focus.

2. Showcase your products in use: Instead of just showing your product on a plain background, consider using lifestyle images that show your product in use. These types of images give your product context and make it easier for your target audience to visualize how it fits into their own lives.

3. Edit your images: Editing your images can help them stand out even more. Consider adjusting the brightness, contrast, and saturation, or adding filters that are on-brand.

By implementing these tips, you can create high-quality images that will catch the eye of your target audience and entice them to click on your ad. From there, it is up to you to deliver an enticing product page and close the sale.

Remember, Instagram ads are all about visuals, so investing in high-quality images can make all the difference in your dropshipping business's success. So, do not hesitate to take advantage of this one simple trick and start creating killer Instagram ads today!

When drop-shipping, there are quite a number of people that know how to set up a Shopify store, find product, edit product photos, and apply a proper item description – the basics of getting started with a new business.
 
However, not many people know how to use Instagram and Facebook ads effectively for maximizing profit. This article will encompass a few tips and tricks to increase Shopify sales via Instagram ads!
 
## Use Video to Your Advantage
 
Video, in most cases, can be more powerful then a still image in terms of conveying ideas. This is why it is a fantastic option for ads. The video you create should encompass the beauty of your product to first and foremost grab attention – and then pull focus of key features about the product or brand from there. The best Instagram and Facebook ad videos are those that are simple in nature but direct as to what the product is. And don’t forget to add a call to action.
 
## It Goes Down in the DM
 

 
Do not be afraid to try direct messaging influencers. These people are always excited to share great products with their fan base for a small charge. Your targeted audience may be more likely to pay attention to your ad if it is coming from someone whom they already follow and trust, rather than a post that is check-marked as “promoted.” Point being, influencer posts are a lot less intrusive than traditional ads.
 
Although, and you will want to listen to this, DO NOT simply spam these influencers with a copied and pasted wall of text. They deal with this sort of thing on the daily, so you will need to keep things personable. As far as knowing exactly what to say, that is something that you will have to learn with time and trials. The types of influencers you wish to introduce to your brand’s products will vary vastly based on how their lifestyles (and therefore their fanbase’s lifestyles) mesh with your products.
 
## Use Emojis and Key Phrases
 
Set up your ad’s description within a notes app so that you can press enter to start a new line. Doing this on Instagram will have no effect, and the lines will just be grouped with no formatting. Clearly separating ideas into lines is crucial to better captivate the audience’s attention.
 
Furthermore, try incorporating emojis that will better convey your ideas into the description. If you are offering free shipping, a box emoji on both sides of the text will better display your idea at a glance. If you sell iPhone accessories, use an iPhone emoji, and so on, meaning base the emoji us on what product you are offering.
 
## Watermark Your Stuff
 
Since you are drop-shipping, chances are the product photos you are using to promote were not taken by you. That is totally okay, but just know that you will not be the only one on the Internet using the photos in promotions. This is why it is  a good idea to “watermark” your photos by placing a logo in a non-intrusive location of the photo, such as the bottom right-hand corner. If you have incorporated your logo or branding into another area of the product, such as a tag, you can disregard this step.
 
## Use Stock Photos – Just Not Boring Ones
 
A lot of the stock photos of products that you will find on sites like Aliexpress focus on the product very specifically and typically feature a stark white background. While this is not necessarily bad in any way, it does not make for good advertising. You will be the most successful browsing a site like Pixabay and subbing out the white background for some abstract art. You can sub out the backgrounds with a desktop-class application such as Photoshop, of course, but a mobile app like Superimpose works wonders when using the magic wand tool.
 
## Build Your Brand Organically
 
While a paid advertisement is a quick way to gain brand exposure, it is not near as good as true followers and fans. Spend some time focusing on adding popular hashtags to your posts, browsing similar accounts, liking posts, and commenting on individuals’ photos. Again, similarly to contacting influencers, DO NOT spam like a bot. Keep it personable, and you will see a high turnover of people from mere browsers to loyal and paying customers.
