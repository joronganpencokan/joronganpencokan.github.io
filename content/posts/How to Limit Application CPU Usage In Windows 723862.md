Title:
Windows Users Beware: Your Applications Are Eating Up Your CPU! Learn How To Stop Them In Their Tracks

Introduction:
Do you constantly find your computer slowing down for no apparent reason? Are you frustrated with your Windows applications hogging your CPU resources? If yes, then this article is for you. In this article, we will discuss how applications use CPU resources, and how you can manage it to optimize your computer's performance.

Body:
Firstly, let's understand the role of the CPU. CPU or Central Processing Unit is the "brain" of your computer. It's responsible for executing commands and running software applications. When multiple applications are running simultaneously, they compete for CPU resources, which slows down your computer. 

Now, let's talk about how to identify the applications that are eating up your CPU resources. 

Task Manager is a built-in Windows utility that allows you to monitor your computer's performance. To open Task Manager, press Ctrl + Alt + Del and select "Task Manager." Once you have opened Task Manager, select the Processes tab to check the applications that are using your CPU resources. 

You will notice that some of the applications use more CPU resources than others. The ones that are occupying a significant percentage of CPU resources need to be addressed immediately. Here are some tips to prevent your applications from hogging CPU resources:

1. Kill Resource-Intensive Processes: If an application is using an excessive amount of CPU resources, you can terminate the process from the Task Manager. Select the process with high CPU usage, and click the ‘End Task’ button to stop the application.

2. Uninstall Bloatware: Windows comes with pre-installed applications that are not useful for everyone. These applications consume valuable system resources and slow down your computer. Go to Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a program and uninstall the apps you don't use.

3. Limit Startup Applications: Applications that start automatically consume CPU resources, even if you don't use them. To disable startup apps, go to Task Manager > Startup, and disable the apps that you don't want to start with Windows.

4. Upgrade Your Hardware: Upgrading your CPU, RAM, or hard drive will improve your computer's performance. However, it's an expensive option and not always necessary.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, applications that eat up CPU resources can significantly affect your computer's performance. Fortunately, Windows provides tools to help you identify and stop these resource-intensive applications. With these tips, you can optimize your computer's performance by limiting CPU usage and improving your system's responsiveness.

Previously, when we discussed the way to limit CPU usage of any process in Linux, many of you were asking how you can achieve the same effect in Windows. So here is it, the way to manage your application CPU usage in Windows.
 
There are several ways that you can do so, but the easiest way I have found is via the use of Process Tamer.Process Tamer is a donation-ware that runs in your system tray and constantly monitors the cpu usage of other processes. When it sees a process that is overloading your cpu, it reduces the priority of that process temporarily, until its cpu usage returns to a reasonable level.
 
### Using Process Tamer
 
Download Process Tamer from DonationCoder.com.
 
Run the installer. (The application works on Windows XP/2K/NT/Vista/Win7)
 
Once you have completed the installation, run the Process Tamer application. At first run, you will see the window as shown below:
 
You will be prompted to enter a license key. If you are wondering why you need a license key for a free software, this is because ProcessTamer is a donation-ware and the process to acquire a license is to encourage you to make a donation to support the developer.
 
To acquire your free license key, go to Donation Coder Forum and register a user account. Once you have created a user account, go to Process Tamer license page. Copy the license and paste to the Process Tamer app.
 
After the app is activated, it will automatically run in the system tray, monitoring your computer’s CPU usage. This is what you will see when you open the configuration window.
 
You can see the Priority assigned to individual process. If you see that an application is taking far too much CPU resources, or that you wish to limit a particular app to low priority, you can manually set the “Explicitly Rule” to “Force below normal” or “Force Low”.
 
On the Configuration tab, the more important thing you should take note is the marker for CPU Trigger Low and High usage. You can set the value to a higher or lower value if you find the default values don’t work well for you.
 
You can also select if Process Tamer should start on boot up.
 
Overall, Process Tamer works pretty well even if left alone. You can simply install and leave it and it will do the necessary monitoring. If, however you need to restrict certain apps to have high or low priority, Process Tamer allows you to do so too.
