# Unlock The Ultimate Potential Of Your ICS Smartphone With This Step-By-Step Rooting Guide!

Are you looking to unleash the full power of your ICS smartphone? Do you want to customize your device to your heart's content and unlock advanced features and functionalities that are not available to the ordinary user? Then rooting your smartphone is the way to go! In this comprehensive guide, we will take you through the process of rooting your ICS smartphone step-by-step, so you can enjoy the full potential of your device.

## What is rooting?

Rooting is the process of unlocking the full administrative control of your smartphone, also known as "root access." By default, your smartphone is locked down by the manufacturer, and you are only allowed to use the features and applications that they have provided for you. However, rooting your phone gives you access to the core system files and allows you to install custom ROMs, tweak the settings, and enjoy advanced features and functionalities that are not available to the average user.

## Should you root your ICS smartphone?

The decision to root your smartphone is entirely up to you. Rooting has its advantages and disadvantages, and you should carefully consider both before proceeding. Some of the benefits of rooting your ICS smartphone include:

* Customization: You can customize your device to your liking by installing custom ROMs, themes, and icons.

* Performance: You can improve the performance of your smartphone by removing bloatware and tweaking the settings.

* Advanced features: You can enjoy advanced features and functionalities that are not available to the average user, such as ad-blocking, Wi-Fi tethering, and overclocking.

On the other hand, rooting also has its drawbacks, such as:

* Security: Rooting your smartphone can expose it to security risks and vulnerabilities if not done correctly.

* Warranty: Rooting your smartphone may void its warranty, and you may not be able to get it repaired or replaced if something goes wrong.

* Compatibility: Some apps may not work correctly on a rooted device, and you may experience compatibility issues.

Before proceeding with the rooting process, make sure you understand the risks and potential consequences.

## How to root your ICS smartphone

Now that you have decided to root your ICS smartphone let's dive into the rooting process. Please note that the rooting process may vary depending on the brand and model of your device, and you should always follow the instructions carefully to avoid bricking your device. Here are the general steps to root your ICS smartphone:

1. Backup your data: Before rooting your smartphone, make sure to backup all your data, including contacts, messages, and media files. Rooting your smartphone may erase all your data, and you don't want to lose anything valuable.

2. Install ADB and Fastboot: ADB and Fastboot are essential tools in the rooting process, and you need to install them on your computer. You can find them on the Android SDK platform tools website.

3. Enable USB debugging: To connect your smartphone to your computer, you need to enable USB debugging on your device. Go to Settings > Developer options > USB debugging and turn it on.

4. Unlock the bootloader: The bootloader is a program that loads the operating system when you turn on your smartphone. Unlocking the bootloader is the first step in rooting your smartphone, and you can do it by following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.

5. Install a custom recovery: A custom recovery is a tool that allows you to flash custom ROMs, backups, and other modifications to your smartphone. To install a custom recovery, download the appropriate recovery file for your device and flash it using Fastboot.

6. Root your smartphone: Finally, it's time to root your smartphone. Download the appropriate rooting package for your device, boot into recovery mode, and flash the package. Once the flashing is complete, reboot your smartphone, and you should have root access.

Congratulations! You have successfully rooted your ICS smartphone! Now it's time to explore the advanced features and functionalities and customize your device to your heart's content.

## Conclusion

Rooting your ICS smartphone can be a rewarding experience if done correctly. With root access, you can unlock the full power of your device and enjoy advanced features and functionalities that are not available to the average user. However, rooting your smartphone also has its risks and drawbacks, and you should carefully evaluate them before proceeding. If you decide to root your smartphone, make sure to follow the instructions carefully, backup your data, and always be cautious. With this step-by-step rooting guide, you should be able to root your ICS smartphone and unlock the ultimate potential of your device.

So, here we are, finally! A rooting tutorial. Now, before you say “there are tons of such tutorials on the web!”, know that many do not work properly or do not have the hole information you need to successfully root your Ice Cream Sandwich Android smartphone.

 
#### What does “rooting” even mean?


Well, in short, rooting is the process that allows you to use apps that require special permissions to access protected data on your phone, normally locked by the Android OS. The explanation is much more complex but I won’t bother you with details. Those of you who have used Linux OS in the past should be familiar with the terms “root” and “superuser”.

 
### How to root Ice Cream Sandwich smartphones


The process is identical for other Android versions also. I have used it to root my Nexus S on Android Gingerbread and ICS (we will give you an update for Jelly Bean after I install it). Before we move on, I have to warn you that rooting/unrooting your Android device will erase all data on your phone! So better make a few backups before you proceed.
1. You will need to download and install the Android driver for your device. The Android ADB Interface is required for you to proceed further. A quick search on Google for the Android ADB for any device will give you lots of places from where you can acquire them. After the download, install the driver.
2. Power off your device and enter Recovery Mode. On some smartphones (Nexus and SGS series), you do this by holding down the Power Button and the Volume Down button together. If this does not work, again, ask Google how to enter Recovery Mode on your device. Once you are there, plug your phone to the USB cable and connect it to your computer.
3. Download the Fastboot for your device. A list of fastboot zip files is available here (Fastboot Files). If not, consult the forum from XDA developers under your device, you will certainly find the zip there. After downloading the file, unzip it to a folder (I prefer to put it in my C:/ partition because it’s easier to find later on).
4. Open a Command Prompt and start unrooting. Use the “cd\” command to navigate to the folder with the fastboot you’ve just downloaded (example: cd\ fastbootICS, if you have the folder on your C: partition and it’s called fastbootICS). When reaching the folder, type the following line in the Command Prompt: fastboot oem unlock.
You will see that your screen has changed (on your smartphone), asking you if you want to root. Select “Yes” by using the Volume Keys and press the power button. Now your phone will restart and enter the Bootloader. You will see the Lock State of your phone change from “LOCKED” to “UNLOCKED”. Congratulations, you have now rooted your device! But there is one more thing you need to do before you are done.
Your smartphone might be unlocked, but you still have to install a Recovery and the Superuser app. I recommend the ones from Clockwork, they work really good, and now they have developed a recovery that works on the touchscreen.
5. There are a few ways to download the Recovery file. An app called ROM Manager is available on the Play Store that allows you to download it, or the old fashioned mode, by searching for the zip file. A list of zip files very well sorted by devices can be founded on the ClockworkMod Website. Go ahead and download the file and place it in the same folder as the fastboot file.
After doing so, return to the Command Prompt and type the following: “fastboot flash recovery name of the recovery file”. Your phone will restart when the process is complete and then you will see the Recovery option on the Bootloader. You can navigate to it by using the volume keys.
6. After doing this, the last step in rooting your device is to install the Superuser app. The app can be found on many websites, here is a link for downloading one from the XDA forum.
After downloading it, head back to your phone and enter the Recovery Mode by using the volume keys to scroll and selecting with the Power Button. Upon entering, you will see lots of options, scroll to the “Mount – Mount USB Storage” option and select it. Now your computer will see the SD card from your phone. Copy the Superuser zip file on your SD card. After doing so, click “Unmount”.
Now, from your phone, navigate to the “Install” button, (if another menu shows up, select “Install zip from SD card”) and navigate to the zip file. Click on the file and install it (“Flash Now”). After the flashing of the file is complete, select the “Reboot” option and you are done!
Now you can enjoy your completely rooted Android Smartphone, complete with the Superuser app. This will allow you to use apps that require special permissions, like Titanium Backup, overclock your smartphone or use custom ROMs.  Also, for more information, visit the XDA Forum, there you will see a complete list of almost any Android device and any issues you might have will find an answer.
