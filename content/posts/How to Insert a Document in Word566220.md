# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Insert A Document In Word - See How In 3 Simple Steps!

Microsoft Word is an application that has become ubiquitous in the world of work, education, and personal use. It is widely used for creating, editing, and formatting all kinds of documents. And, one of the most important features of Word is the ability to insert various objects like images, tables, and charts. But what about inserting documents? Well, you won't believe how easy it is to insert a document in Word. In this article, we will show you how to do it in just three simple steps.

## Step 1: Open Word Document

The first step is to open the Word document in which you want to insert a document. You can either create a new document or open an existing one. To create a new document, click on the "File" tab, then select "New" and choose the document type you want to create. To open an existing document, click on the "File" tab, then select "Open" and navigate to the file location.

## Step 2: Insert Document

Once the document is open, you can now insert the desired document. To do this, click on the "Insert" tab in the ribbon menu. In the "Text" section, click on the "Object" button. A new window will open, and you will see several tabs. Click on the "Create from File" tab, and then click on the "Browse" button to locate the document you want to insert.

Select the file you want to insert and click on the "Insert" button. You can then choose how you want the object to be displayed. You can either display it as an icon or as a document. If you choose to display it as an icon, you can double-click on it to open the document. If you choose to display it as a document, you can edit it directly in your Word document.

## Step 3: Save and Close

Once you have inserted the document, you can save your Word document. To save a document, click on the "File" tab and select "Save" or "Save As." Give the file a name and choose the location where you want to save it.

You can then close the inserted document window by clicking on the "X" button in the top-right corner. And, that's it! You have successfully inserted a document in your Word document.

## Conclusion

This is a useful way to reference a document without importing the text into your existing document.
