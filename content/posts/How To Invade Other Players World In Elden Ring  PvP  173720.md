## Unleash chaos in Elden Ring: Learn how to invade and conquer other players' worlds in PVP!

Are you ready to unleash chaos and show off your PVP skills in Elden Ring? With the game's release just around the corner, it's never too early to start planning your invasion strategies. In this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about invading and conquering other players' worlds in PVP mode.

### Understanding PVP

PVP (player versus player) is a game mode in which players can fight against each other, rather than working together to fight AI enemies. Elden Ring's PVP mode is based on invading other players' worlds, giving you the chance to prove your combat skills against other human players.

### The Invasion Process

Before invading another player's world, you'll need to make sure you have the necessary items. In Elden Ring, you'll need a Red Eye Orb or Cracked Red Eye Orb to invade other players' worlds. These items can be bought from certain vendors or found in the game world.

Once you have one of these items, you can use it to invade another player's world. To do this, you'll need to be in the right area, as certain areas may have restrictions on PVP invasions. When you're ready to invade, use the Red Eye Orb, and the game will search for a world to invade. If a match is found, you'll be transported to the player's world, and the battle for supremacy begins.

### Invading Strategies

The key to a successful invasion is having a solid strategy. Here are a few tips to help you conquer your opponents' worlds:

- Scout the area: Before you invade, take a look around the area to get an idea of what you're up against. Take note of any potential ambush points or hazards that could work to your advantage.

- Be unpredictable: Your opponent will be expecting you, so be unpredictable in your approach. Use different tactics to catch your opponent off guard and keep them guessing.

- Use the environment: The environment can be your ally in Elden Ring. Use the terrain and obstacles to your advantage, using them as cover or to set up traps.

- Stay aggressive: Don't let your opponent take the upper hand. Stay on the offensive and keep the pressure on, using your weapons and magic to deal maximum damage.

### Conclusion

Conquering other players' worlds in Elden Ring's PVP mode requires skill, strategy, and a readiness to adapt to any situation. With the right preparation and mindset, you'll be able to stand victorious over your opponents.

So, get ready to unleash chaos, sharpen your combat skills, and become a conqueror in Elden Ring's PVP mode!

As you may already know, players require multiplayer items to experience Co-op, PvP or Invasion mechanics of this open-world game. Wondering how to invade other players’ games and worlds in Elden Ring? Here’s the item you need to use.
 
## How to Invade Other Players Worlds in Elden Ring?
 

 
To invade other players, you require the Bloody Finger item which is a one-time consumable. With this, you can invade another player’s world. If your attempt is successful, players have to beat the Host of Fingers of the world where you were summoned. And during the invasion, Finger Phantoms can be used as items. Head to the Rose Church in Liurnia of the Lakes to find the Bloody Finger.
 
Note that you might just not have to kill the host, but also beat the co-op allies that they have summoned. Once you beat the host, you will be sent back to your own world. Players can use the Finger Severer item to head back to their world as well or to send a co-op ally back to their world. You cannot use this to send an invader back – players must fight and kill them to end the session. You can obtain the Finger Severer by searching the corpse in Stranded Graveyard.

### More things to know about Invasion
 
- You can also attempt to invade the same world you have previously invaded before.
 - If you want to avoid getting invaded, here’s how to do it. This will significantly reduce the challenge, but with this, you can focus on the solo campaign without worrying about players trying to attack you.
 - In case you are invaded and you want to request the help of another hunter, you need to use the White Cipher Ring. This will automatically send a request for a Hunter after your invasion occurs. You can buy this ring at the cost of 1000 Runes at the Twin Maiden Husks (Roundtable Hold).
 - In case you want to lure in invaders, use the Taunter’s Tongue item.
 - With the use of a Small Red Effigy, you can send a competitive sign to a summoning pool.  You can try to jump into another player’s world to beat its host and other allies. This item can be found on a corpse near the Stormhill Colosseum entrance.
 - And with a Duelist’s Furled Finger, you can create a competitive multiplayer summon sign. For this, you have to beat the Host of Fingers of the world where you were summoned. This item can be found on a corpse near the Stormhill Colosseum entrance.
