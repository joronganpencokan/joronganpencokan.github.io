Power Slider

The Build 15014 update introduces the Power Slider, a feature that lets you customize the power consumption settings of your device. You can now choose between different power modes, each designed to provide optimal performance or battery life, depending on your needs.

The available modes include:

The Power Slider is accessible from the battery icon in the taskbar, where you can simply click and drag the slider to switch between modes. The feature is particularly useful for laptop users who are always on the go, as it lets them adjust their device’s power consumption according to their needs.

Color Picker

The Color Picker is another exciting addition to Build 15014. This feature allows you to pick and customize the accent color of your device, giving you more control over its appearance. You can choose from a wide range of colors and shades, and preview them in real-time to see how they affect different design elements such as taskbar and Start menu.

Customizing the accent color of your device may seem like a minor detail, but it can make a huge difference in terms of personalization and visual appeal. With the Color Picker, you can easily match your device’s color scheme with your own preferences or brand identity.
