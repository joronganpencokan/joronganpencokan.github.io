Here’s a secret that pro players don’t want you to know: muting players and disabling voice chat in Valorant can give you a major advantage in the game.

Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter that requires teamwork and communication to win. However, toxic players can ruin the game by hurling insults and distracting their teammates. It’s crucial to know how to mute players and disable voice chat to avoid such hindrances.

Muting players can be done in two ways. Firstly, you can use the ‘Tab’ button on your keyboard to bring up the scoreboard. Click on the offending player’s name and then press ‘Tab’ again to mute them. You’ll not be able to hear them but will still receive their pings and text chat.

Secondly, you can use the chat command "/mute 'player name'" to mute a player directly without going to the scoreboard. Just make sure to replace 'player name' with the in-game name of the player you want to mute.

Disabling voice chat is also very easy. You can simply go to the settings menu, choose ‘Audio’ and toggle the ‘Voice Chat’ off. This will prevent all voice communication from other players. 

Many pro players play with the voice chat turned off by default. They rely on pings, text chat, and map awareness to communicate with their team. This helps them stay focused on their own individual gameplay and not get distracted by the team’s banter.

However, disabling voice chat completely can also have its drawbacks. Communication is key in Valorant, and sometimes hearing your teammate's callouts can be the difference between winning or losing a round. Therefore, it is important to find a balance that works for you and your team.

In conclusion, muting players and disabling voice chat in Valorant can give you a major advantage in the game. It can help you avoid distractions and stay focused on your gameplay, but sometimes it can also hinder communication between teammates. As a player, it's up to you to use these features responsibly and find the perfect balance that works for you and your team.
