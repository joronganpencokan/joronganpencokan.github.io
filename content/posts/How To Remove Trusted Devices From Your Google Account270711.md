Shocking! Your Personal Info at Risk - Learn How to Remove Trusted Devices from Your Google Account NOW!

It is hardly surprising that we use our Google accounts for just about everything in our digital lives. We use them to access our email, social media accounts, online banking, and more.

But what most of us fail to consider is how such activities put our personal information at risk. That's because if someone gains access to our Google account, they automatically have access to all the apps and services we have linked to it.

Fortunately, there is a way to keep our Google accounts and personal information safe. By removing trusted devices from our accounts, we can secure our personal information from potential hackers who may have accessed our devices.

To get started, here's what you need:

1. A web browser

2. Access to your Google account

Now, let's dive into the process of removing trusted devices from your Google account.

Step 1: Log in to your Google Account

Head over to your browser and go to the Google homepage. Proceed to log into your account by entering your email address and password.

Once you're logged in, look for the drop-down menu on the upper right-hand corner of the page. Click it, and several options will appear.

Step 2: Go to the "Security" tab

From the drop-down menu, select the "Manage Your Google Account" option. This will take you to your Google account's dashboard.

On the lower right-hand side of your screen, you will see a section called "Security." Go ahead and click on it.

Step 3: Click on "Manage Devices"

Under the "Security" menu, you will see the "Your Devices" section. Go ahead and click on "Manage Devices."

Here, you will see a list of all the devices that have access to your Google account. These devices are labeled as "trusted."

Step 4: Revoke access to a "trusted" device

Find the device you want to remove from the trusted list, then click on it. You will now see a pop-up message, and from there, click "Remove" to erase its access to your Google account.

You can also choose to remove or revoke access to multiple devices at once. Do this by selecting multiple devices and hitting the "Remove" button.

Once you're done, make sure you sign out of all your devices associated with your Google account, and you're all done!

Final thoughts

Removing trusted devices from your Google account may seem like a small step but is an important one when it comes to protecting your sensitive data. The process is simple and can be done in a few clicks. If you're unsure which devices to remove, you can always start with those you're no longer using or recognize.

Well, if you have been using Google apps and services for a while, then you might know that Google provides users an option to set trusted devices. If you have 2-step verification enabled, then you will receive a prompt on the trusted device or verified the phone number.
Trusted devices were meant for those who don’t want to enter the 2-step verification code every time while login into the Google Account. It basically allows users to mark a computer or mobile device as ‘Trusted’. On the trusted devices, you no longer need to enter the verification code each time you sign in.
