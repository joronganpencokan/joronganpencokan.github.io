# Windows Users Rejoice! Discover This Simple Trick to Rollback Updates Even After the Dreaded 10-Day Limit!

Updating your computer is essential to ensure that it runs smoothly and securely. However, sometimes the updates may cause issues, and you would like to revert to the previous version of Windows. Unfortunately, Windows 10 only allows you to roll back updates within ten days of installation. After the ten days have passed, you are stuck with the latest version of the operating system, whether you like it or not.

However, there is a way to rollback updates even after the ten-day limit using a simple trick that involves a system restore point. A system restore point is a snapshot of your computer's settings and state at a particular point in time. It allows you to restore your computer to that specific point if anything goes wrong.

Here's how you can use a system restore point to rollback updates in Windows 10 after the ten-day limit:

1. Open the Start menu and type "Create a restore point" in the search bar.

2. Click on the "Create a restore point" option that appears in the search results.

3. In the System Properties window that opens, click on the System Protection tab.

4. Click on the "Create" button to create a new restore point.

5. Enter a description for the restore point, such as "Before the latest Windows update."

6. Click on the Create button to create the restore point.

7. Once the restore point has been created, and you encounter an issue with the latest Windows update, open the Start menu and type "System Restore" in the search bar.

8. Click on the "System Restore" option that appears in the search results.

9. In the System Restore window that opens, click on the "Next" button.

10. Select the restore point you created earlier from the list of available restore points.

11. Click on the "Next" button.

12. Click on the "Finish" button to start the system restore process.

13. Wait for the system restore to complete. Your computer will restart after the restore process finishes.

14. Once your computer has started, check if the issue you were having with the latest Windows update has been resolved.

Rolling back updates in Windows 10 after the ten-day limit may seem like an impossible task, but with this simple trick, you can do it without breaking a sweat. By creating a system restore point before installing updates, you can ensure that you can always revert to the previous version of Windows if anything goes wrong. So, the next time you encounter an issue with the latest Windows update, don't panic. Just follow these steps, and you'll be back to your stable and functional version of Windows in no time.

However, what if the ten-day period has passed? In that case, you need to utilize some other tricks to roll back to the previous version of Windows 10. It’s possible to revert to the previous version of the operating system even if ten days have passed.
However, there’s no direct option to roll back Windows updates after ten days. You need to manually change few settings to roll back Windows updates after ten days of the upgrade.

 
### Things you should know


Whenever your PC installs a new update, the older version files get stored on the Windows.old folder. Microsoft keeps this folder for 10 days, allowing you to roll back to the previous version.
However, once the ten-day period has passed, Windows automatically deletes the files stored in the Windows.old folder. Microsoft does this to free up storage space on your device. That means, after ten days, you won’t get the option to roll back to the previous Windows version.

 
## Steps to Rollback to the previous version in Windows (After 10 days)


Since Microsoft stores the previous version files on the Windows.old folder and retains it for 10 days, the trick here is to rename the Windows.old folder.
After upgrading to a newer version, you need to rename the Windows.old folder to something else if you wish to preserve it. Follow some of the simple steps below to rename the Windows.old folder.
Step 1. First of all, open File Explorer on your Windows 10 computer.
Step 2. Now click on the ‘View‘ button as shown in the screenshot.

Step 3. Next, click on the ‘Options‘ to open the Folder options.

 
Step 4. Select the View tab and enable the ‘Show hidden files, folders, and drives’. Also, uncheck the box next to ‘Hide protected operating system files’.

Step 5. Now on C:drive, find the folder ‘Windows.old’. You need to rename it to something else like Windowsold.old.


That’s it! You are done. Now, whenever you wish to roll back to the previous version, head to the C:drive and rename the folder to Windows.old. Next, follow the steps shared on this guide – How to Rollback Windows 10 Updates (Including Insider Builds) to roll back Windows 10 updates.
