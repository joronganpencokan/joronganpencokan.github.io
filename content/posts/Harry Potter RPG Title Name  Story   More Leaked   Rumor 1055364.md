The Harry Potter universe has been one of the most beloved literary and cinematic franchises of all time, captivating people of all ages and backgrounds with its magical world of wizardry, spells, and fantastic creatures. Whether you're a die-hard fan or a casual enthusiast, you can't help but be excited about the latest rumors of a Harry Potter RPG game that promises to immerse you in an all-new adventure set in this iconic world.

According to insiders and leaks, the game is being developed by Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment, in collaboration with Portkey Games, the gaming division of Harry Potter publisher, J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World Digital. The title is reportedly titled "Hogwarts Legacy" and is set during the 19th century, well before the events of the films and books.

Players will play as a Hogwarts student, customizing their character and attending classes to learn spells, potions, and magical skills. The game world will be fully open, allowing players to explore the Forbidden Forest, Hogsmeade, and other iconic locations from the books, meet magical creatures, and interact with other students and professors. As the story unfolds, players will find themselves embroiled in a dangerous plot to uncover the secrets of a long-lost magic that threatens the entire wizarding world.

The leak suggests that the game's storyline is an original creation, written by award-winning game writers and Harry Potter fans, who worked closely with J.K. Rowling to ensure authenticity and continuity with the original canon. The plot is said to be dark, complex, and full of surprises, weaving together elements from various aspects of the Harry Potter universe to create a compelling and immersive experience.

The graphics and visual effects of the game are also rumored to be top-notch, with highly detailed character models, realistic environments, and spectacular spell-casting animations. The game is said to be targeting next-generation consoles, such as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, as well as PC, ensuring that fans can enjoy the game at the highest possible quality.

Fans have been eagerly waiting for more information about the Harry Potter RPG since its announcement back in 2018, and this latest leak has only served to increase their anticipation and excitement. Social media is buzzing with comments, memes, and speculations about the game, with many expressing their incredulity at the rumors.

Some fans are skeptical, fearing that the game may not live up to the hype, or worse, contradict the original canon. Others are hopeful, seeing it as a chance to finally live out their dreams of attending Hogwarts and experiencing the magic firsthand. Whatever the case may be, one thing is for sure: the Harry Potter RPG will be one of the most highly anticipated games of the year, and fans will be closely watching for any updates and news about its release date and details.

During the last month of 2018, the gameplay of a new Harry Potter RPG game was surprisingly leaked. Many years have passed and we have had no official information about this new project. But, today a leak might have just revealed the name of this game, called Hogwarts: A Dark Legacy.
 
In a recently leaked information, we found out that the game, presumably in the hands of Avalanche Software, would already have a release window. The rumor gives us a rough idea of ​​the mechanics, story, and other details of this unannounced RPG.
 
So, as per the information shared on Reddit, the game will be based on the Harry Potter universe, but will not bear the name of the popular wizard in its title. The game would be called Hogwarts: A Dark Legacy and it would allow us to be a student at Hogwarts.
 
The details suggest that in this new game we would start a course at the magic school and could progress until we graduated. The title would have a customization system with which we would create our character. We could choose our gender and if the protagonist can be a muggle-born, half-blood, or pure blood.
 
The leak also mentions that the game could reach a Mature classification due to the elements of romance that will be in the game, since it would be possible to get married. As for its narrative, Voldemort would not be the antagonist, instead, the central villain would be a Death Eater who would be in charge of a small group of wicked wizards.
 
The new Harry Potter RPG would feature a large world with areas from Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, The Ministry, and another undisclosed area. Also, a skill tree is mentioned that would allow us to learn new powers. There would be a total of 5 branches, but none would offer the possibility of learning prohibited spells.
 
Lastly, there will be some side activities like the possibility of playing Quidditch and a card minigame. Recall that, this information is not yet official, so it will be best to take this leaked information with a big grain of salt.
