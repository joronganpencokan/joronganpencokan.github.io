Title: Unlock the Secret Shortcut: Effortlessly Add Degree Symbol in Microsoft Word!

If you are a heavy user of Microsoft Word, you might have come across the need to add degree symbols, especially when writing articles that require temperature measurements, such as weather reports, chemistry experiments or baking recipes. 

But did you know that you can quickly and easily add a degree symbol in Microsoft Word without having to go to the Insert menu or memorize the alt code? Yes, you read that right, there is a secret shortcut that unlocks this convenience, and this article will show you how to use it.

Step 1: Place the Cursor Where You Want to Insert the Degree Symbol

Open Microsoft Word, navigate to the document where you want to insert a degree symbol, and place the cursor where you want the symbol to appear. You can use this shortcut anytime, whether in the body text, a header, a footer, or a table cell.

Step 2: Press the Shortcut Key Combo

Here's the magic shortcut key combo: press and hold the Alt key while typing 0176 on the numeric keypad (make sure Num Lock is on). Then release the Alt key, and voila! The degree symbol (°) will appear where your cursor was placed.

Note: if you don't have a numeric keypad on your keyboard or laptop, you can use the on-screen keyboard that comes with Windows. Simply search for "on-screen keyboard" in the Start menu, click it to open, and press the Alt key and the numbers on the keyboard's virtual keypad. 

Step 3: Use the Degree Symbol as Much as You Want

Congratulations, you have unlocked the secret to adding degree symbols in Microsoft Word with ease! Now you can use this shortcut anytime you need a degree symbol in your document, without interrupting your flow, slowing down your typing speed, or searching through menus.

You can use the degree symbol to express temperatures in Celsius (°C) or Fahrenheit (°F), angles in degrees (°), gradients in percent (°P), or other unit of measure that requires the symbol.

Bonus Tip: Customize the Autocorrect Feature

If you find yourself using the degree symbol frequently, you can customize the Autocorrect feature in Microsoft Word to automatically replace an abbreviation with the symbol. Here's how:

1. Go to the File menu, click Options, and select Proofing.
2. Click Autocorrect Options, and in the Replace box, type a unique abbreviation like "degsym".
3. In the With box, type the degree symbol (°), and click Add and OK.
4. Test the autocorrect by typing the abbreviation followed by a space or punctuation mark. The degree symbol should appear automatically.

Conclusion

Adding a degree symbol in Microsoft Word doesn't have to be a chore or a memory game, thanks to the secret shortcut that unlocks this convenience. By pressing the Alt key and the numeric code 0176, you can effortlessly insert the symbol anywhere in your document. Give it a try, and you'll be amazed at how much time and energy you'll save!

Sometimes you may want to insert the degree symbol in Microsoft Word to show temperature readings rather than typing the word “degrees.” However, this may not be as easy as it sounds because you won’t find the degree symbol on your keyboard.
 
There are actually several great ways to do this, including using your keyboard. Even though you don’t see the symbol, it doesn’t mean there isn’t a way to type it. We focus on Windows here but do provide solutions for macOS and Linux too.
 
## 1. Use the Symbol Menu in Word
 
Microsoft Word and Libre Office come with a built-in special characters menu that you can use to insert the degree sign. To access the symbols menu in Word, simply follow the steps below:
 
Select the “Insert” tab and navigate to the “Symbols” section towards the far-right end of the screen. Click the “Symbols” icon, and you should see a list of the most common or recently used symbols.
 
Click the “More Symbols” option and a rectangular grid with a full list of many different symbols will open. Locate the degree sign and click on it. You’ll also be able to see a description of the degree symbol you’ve highlighted just above the “AutoCorrect” button.
 
Move the cursor to where you want to insert the degree sign in the Word document, then click the “Insert” button in the characters menu. Now every time you open the Symbols menu, you should see the degree sign in the list of the recently-used symbols.
 
You can go a step further, and if you often use the degree symbol you can create your own shortcut to insert it (we’re going to go with Alt + o, because isn’t a degree symbol a kind of tiny ‘o’?).
 
Go back to the Symbol window in word, select the degree symbol, then click “Shortcut Key.”
 
In the “Customize Keyboard” window that pops up, click the “Press new shortcut key” text box, enter the keyboard shortcut you’d like to use then click “Assign”. You can even have more than one shortcut per symbol.
 
## 2. Using Copy and Paste
 
If you rarely use the degree symbol in Microsoft Word, it’s hard to remember keyboard shortcuts or how to open special menus. If this is the case, you can use a simple trick to avoid having to remember anything: copy and paste. 
 
The Wikipedia List of Unicode Characters is a great place to start. Simply use your browser’s search feature to search for the name of the symbol, then copy the symbol and paste it into Word.
 
CopyPasteCharacter is another great resource. Expand the All Characters menu, which floats as you scroll, to filter characters by type or use the search box within the menu. Then, copy the symbol you want and paste it in your Word doc. You’ll find more characters here than on Wikipedia’s list, so it’s a great option to bookmark to quickly access when you need it. Also, when you click a symbol, you can copy the HTML shortcode if you’re creating web pages in Word.
 
For frequently used symbols, create a Word doc with just those symbols listed, then copy and paste. To make it easier to use, type the name of the symbol beside it. You will have your own copy and paste resource right on your desktop. This works for all operating systems.
 
## 3. Use the Keyboard Shortcut
 
Using a keyboard shortcut is the easiest method to insert symbols into a document. The only problem is you’ll need to remember some rarely used short codes. You can always keep a Notepad document on your desktop for easy reference. Fortunately, with this method, you just need to hit a combination of keys to insert the degree sign anywhere in a Word document.
 
The bad thing about this method is that it may not work for you if your laptop keyboard doesn’t have a number pad. Desktop models come equipped with number pads, but most laptops forgo the number pad due to space limitations.
 
To insert the degree sign, first make press the Num key to enable Num Lock and make those number bad work as numbers rather than their alternative functions.
 
Then simply follow these two steps:
 
- Select where you want to insert the degree symbol in Microsoft Word.While holding down the Alt key, use the keypad to type “0176.” Release the Alt key, and the degree sign will appear.

 
Note: for this method to work, the Num Lock on your keyboard MUST be OFF. If it’s ON, the keyboard will not accept numerical input.
 
If you’d like to know how to insert other symbols using this method, Alt Codes lists most every symbol code.
 
For macOS, use this keyboard shortcut instead: Option + Shift + 8. Option + K gives you a slightly different degree symbol, so try both to see which looks best for your needs.
 
Linux uses Unicode versus Alt Codes: Ctrl + Shift + U followed by 00B0. Hit Enter and the degree symbol will appear. Use this guide to learn different ways to insert special characters in Linux.
 
## 4. Use Character Map
 
To use this method, follow the steps below.
 
- Open your Start menu and type “Character Map” in the search box. Hit Enter. This searches your computer for the Character Map program.

 
- Double-click the Character Map desktop app that will appear to open the program. Here you’ll find a list of symbols and characters.

 
- At the bottom of the program, you should see the “Advanced view” box. Click to check it. Skip this step if it’s already checked. The essence of checking the box is to be able to easily find the degree sign from a list of over one-hundred symbols.Now it’ll be easy to locate the degree sign. Type “degree sign” in the search box as illustrated below, then click the search button, and all the other symbols will clear, leaving behind only the degree sign.

 
- Double-click the degree sign, then click “Copy.” Go to the Word document where you want to insert it and click Ctrl + V to paste it. You can use the same procedure to insert any other special character into Word or a webpage.

 
For macOS users, you have a similar feature called Character Viewer. Use Control + Command + Space to bring up the viewer. You can insert accents, special characters, emojis, and mathematical symbols.
 
Inserting a degree symbol in Microsoft Word only takes seconds once you know how to do it. No matter which method you prefer, you can finally skip typing out “degrees” and insert the symbol instead. Plus, once you’ve learned to do this, you’ll be able to insert other types of symbols, too.
