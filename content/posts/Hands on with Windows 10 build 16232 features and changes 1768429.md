# Windows 10 just got a massive upgrade! Get an inside look at all the exciting new features and changes with Build 16232!

Are you ready for a new and improved Windows 10 experience? The latest Windows 10 Build 16232 has a lot of exciting new features, changes, and improvements that make it a must-have for any Windows user. In this article, we'll take a closer look at all the new additions in Build 16232 and explore their potential benefits.

## Better Windows Defender Security

Windows Defender is the built-in antivirus and threat protection software in Windows 10, and Build 16232 introduces some significant improvements to it. With this new build, Windows Defender now features an enhanced user interface that makes it easier to use and more accessible. Also, there's a new "Device Performance and Health" section that helps you identify and address issues that can impact your device's performance.

Moreover, Build 16232 introduces a new feature called "Controlled Folder Access," which provides extra security against ransomware attacks. Controlled Folder Access limits the access of suspicious or unauthorized applications to your system files and folders, making it harder for malware to steal or damage vital data.

## Cortana Enhancements

Cortana, Microsoft's virtual assistant, got some significant upgrades in Build 16232. The most notable improvement is the ability to manage your music and podcasts with your voice. You can use voice commands to play, pause, or skip tracks, as well as open and interact with music and podcast apps.

Also, the Cortana app is now more integrated with the operating system, enabling it to provide more tailored and personalized experiences based on your preferences.

## Better Action Center

Windows 10's Action Center is the centralized hub for notifications, quick settings, and other system-related functions. Build 16232 introduces a revamped Action Center that features a cleaner and more modern design, improved functionality, and the ability to view and manage notifications from your phone via the Cortana app.

Also, Build 16232 introduces a new feature called "My People" that allows you to pin your most important contacts to the taskbar for quick and easy communication. You can access their profiles, send messages or emails, and even start video calls right from the taskbar.

## Improved Touch and Pen Support

Windows 10 is a versatile operating system that supports touch and pen input on compatible devices. Build 16232 makes significant improvements to touch and pen input by introducing new features like the "Windows Ink Workspace," which provides quick access to ink-based apps and features like sketchpad, screen sketch, and sticky notes.

Also, there are new settings to customize your pen's behaviors, such as inking acceleration, click-and-hold actions, and palm rejection.

## Conclusion

Build 16232 is undoubtedly one of the most significant updates to Windows 10 in recent years. From enhanced security to better Cortana integration, improved touch and pen input, and a revamped Action Center, there's a lot to like in this new build.

So, if you're a Windows 10 user, be sure to get your hands on this new update and experience its fantastic new features and functionality yourself. And, if you haven't tried Windows 10 yet, now is the time to upgrade and enjoy a modern, powerful, and versatile operating system that meets all your computing needs.
