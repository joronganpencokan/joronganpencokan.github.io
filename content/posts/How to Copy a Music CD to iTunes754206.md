##   How to Rip a CD to Digital Files  
 

The fastest way to build your digital music library is to import your CD collection to iTunes. After converting your CD collection into digital music files, synchronize them with your iPhone, iPad, iPod, or another compatible portable music player.

If you haven't installed iTunes for Mac or iTunes on PC, the best place to get the latest version is to download it from the Apple website.

 

It takes about 30 minutes to rip an entire CD of music to your iTunes music library.

 
- Insert an audio CD into the computer's CD or DVD drive or an external drive connected to your computer.
 - Wait for a few seconds until you see a list of tracks. You need an internet connection to pull in all the song titles and album art for the CD. If you don't see the information for the CD, select the CD icon at the top of the iTunes window.
 - Select Yes to import all the songs on the CD. Select No to copy only some of the music on the CD and remove the check mark next to the songs you don't want to copy. (If you don't see any check boxes, choose iTunes > Preferences > General and select List view checkboxes.)
 - Select Import CD.
 - Select the import settings (ACC is the default) and then select OK.
