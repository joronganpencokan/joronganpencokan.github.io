# Discover the Secret Methods to Spy on Anyone's Snapchat in 2023 - You Won't Believe How Easy it Is! 

Are you curious about what your friends, family, or significant other are doing on Snapchat? Do you want to know what they are sending, receiving, or posting on their accounts? Well, you are in luck because we have uncovered some secret methods to spy on anyone's Snapchat in 2023, and it's easier than you think! 

Before we get into the specifics, it's worth mentioning that spying on someone without their consent is unethical, and in some cases, illegal. Therefore, we recommend that you only use these methods for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring your children's online activity or ensuring your employees are not sharing confidential information. 

Now, let's dive into the different ways you can spy on someone's Snapchat account: 

1. Spy Apps 

One of the easiest and most effective ways to spy on someone's Snapchat is by using specialized spy apps. These apps are designed to be discreet and allow you to track all of the target's Snapchat activity, including their snaps, stories, chats, and friends' list. Some of the best spy apps for Snapchat include mSpy, Spyzie, and Hoverwatch. 

To use a spy app, you need to install it on the target's device, which can be a bit tricky if you don't have access to their phone. However, some spy apps offer remote installation, which means you can install them on someone's phone without physically accessing it. Once the app is installed, you can log in from your own device and monitor the target's Snapchat activity in real-time. 

2. Phishing 

Phishing is a technique used to obtain sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, by tricking people into entering their login credentials into a fake website or app. In the case of Snapchat, you can create a fake login page that looks identical to the real one and send it to the target via email, text message, or social media. If the target enters their login information into the fake page, you will receive it, and you can use it to log in to their Snapchat account. 

It's important to note that phishing is illegal, and we do not recommend that you attempt it. Moreover, because Snapchat has implemented two-factor authentication, which requires users to enter a verification code sent to their phone number or email address, phishing has become much less effective. 

3. Keylogging 

Keylogging is a method of recording all the keystrokes made on a device, including usernames and passwords. Therefore, if you install a keylogger on the target's device, you can capture their Snapchat login information and use it to log in to their account. 

There are several ways to install a keylogger on someone's device, including physically accessing it, using a USB keylogger, or sending the target a link to a malicious website that installs the keylogger automatically. However, like phishing, keylogging is an invasive and illegal method that we do not recommend. 

In conclusion, while spying on someone's Snapchat account may seem tempting, it's essential to consider the ethics and legality of such actions. We hope that this article has given you an overview of the different methods used to spy on Snapchat and has convinced you to use these methods for legitimate purposes only. Remember, trust and respect are the foundations of any healthy relationship, be it personal or professional.

Snapchat spy apps can do more than just see Snapchat conversations. These apps, like mSpy, Umobix, and Eyezy can also monitor your device activity, do GPS tracking, and see your call and message history. Protecting your children from harm online has never been easier with monitoring apps.
 
Although instant messaging apps have undoubtedly made our lives easier and more exciting, it’s also undeniable that they can put users in a lot of risky and even dangerous situations – especially those who are too young to know any better.
 
In this article, I’m going to discuss how to monitor Snapchat, a privacy-oriented instant messaging app whose target users are teenagers and young adults. Our top suggestion is mSpy but we will also look at the other options as well.
 
Teenagers, in particular, are often considered a high-risk group. In an up-and-down part of their lives where they’re only figuring out their own identity, they’re the likeliest ones to disregard rules for the sake of fun and excitement. With their unlimited access to the internet and the many instant messaging apps out there, this can be quite harmful.
 
So read on to learn how to monitor your child’s Snapchat!
 
## 3 Ways To Spy On Someone’s Snapchat
 
Although you can see when someone is online on Snapchat, that doesn’t really tell you anything about their activities. If you have a child, especially if they’re in their early teens, it’s still best to know everything that they’re doing online.
 
There are 3 main methods that you can reliably use to spy on people’s Snapchat accounts. In this section, I’ll discuss all of them in detail.
 
### Using mSpy
 
mSpy is a tried and tested device monitoring and parental control app that can help you spy on people’s Snapchat. One of the most popular in the industry, mSpy has reportedly consulted with learning experts to help parents better protect their children via advanced software. The company then used the findings to improve the features of the mSpy app.
 
In this section, we’re going to look at the overview of mSpy’s features, compatibility, pricing, and finally a tutorial on how to use it to spy on someone’s Snapchat. If you want a more in-depth review of the app, you can also take a look at this review.
 

 
#### Main Features
 
As one of the premier parental control apps around, mSpy boasts a wide array of options that can help you keep your children safe online, especially on apps like Snapchat.
 
mSpy sports typical monitoring features. With the app, you can access things such as call logs, messages, website history, apps, media, email, keylogs, and even the Wi-Fi connection of the target device. 
 
mSpy also has features that allow you a certain measure of control over the target device, such as app and website blocking, call management, and even remote lock and device wipe.
 
This means that not only can you monitor Snapchat with mSpy perfectly well, but you can also restrict access to the app if you so choose.
 
In addition, the app also features a pretty comprehensive GPS tracking service that allows you to keep your charge safe by knowing where they are any minute of the day – wherever the target device might be in the world.
 
More than that, you can also set up restricted areas with mSpy, which notifies you whenever the target device passes into the restricted zone.
 
Finally, you can get comprehensive analytics of the target device’s activity on your dashboard with the mSpy app. For instance, if they’ve been using Snapchat for a longer time than they should be, you’ll know.
 
#### Compatibility
 
mSpy can be installed on both Android and iOS devices. That said, there are pretty significant differences between both versions when it comes to compatibility, installation method, and features.
 
mSpy for iOS has different installation requirements depending on whether it is jailbroken or not. Without jailbreak, mSpy can be installed on all iOS versions. On jailbroken systems, however, it can only be installed on iOS versions 7 to 9.1.
 
A lot of the functionalities that make mSpy a great spy app are only available on jailbroken systems, such as GPS tracking and geofencing, and app/call/internet management. 
 
Sadly, this also includes monitoring social media platforms like Messenger and Snapchat. For both versions on iOS, mSpy can be installed remotely by using your iCloud email and password.
 
For Android devices, you can also install with or without rooting – however, the features for unrooted devices are extremely limited. If you want to enjoy mSpy to its fullest and spy on people’s Snapchat, rooting the target device is the way to go. Take note that you need to have physical possession of the target Android phone for installation.
 
#### Pricing
 
mSpy’s subscription cost does not vary between Android and iOS versions.
 
Pricing begins with the 1-month Premium plan at $48.99 a month, followed by the 3-month Premium plan at $27.99 a month, and finally the 12-month Premium plan at $11.66 a month.
 
For the number of features that it offers, these prices are very reasonable. If you need a time-tested, reliable spy app, choose mSpy.
 
#### How To Spy On Other People’s Snapchat With mSpy
 
The Snapchat monitoring app mSpy is a paid service, so mSpy needs you to subscribe to a package first. 
 
Once you’ve subscribed to the package that you want, go ahead and install mSpy on the target device. Make sure that it’s jailbroken or rooted because that’s the only way that the Snapchat monitoring feature will work.
 
Also, take note that you need a registration code in order to install mSpy on a rooted or jailbroken phone. To find mSpy’s registration code, you need to go back to the screen that showed up when you were installing mSpy for the first time. As an alternative, you can reach out to mSpy support and ask them to provide you with the code.
 
With that out of the way, here are the steps:
 
- Once mSpy has been installed on the target device, go to the mSpy User Space.
 - Enter your credentials and log in.
 - You will then enter your mSpy dashboard, where you will see the target device’s general status.
 - On the upper-left-hand corner of your dashboard, click the hamburger icon.
 - You will then be presented with the options menu. Scroll down to see the Snapchat option.
 - Click the Snapchat button to monitor the target device’s Snapchat account.
 - On the tab, you will then see a summary of the target device’s Snapchat account and its activities. You can see their most recent messages, and you can also click the profile icon to see their contacts on the app.

 
### Using Umobix
 
Umobix may be a newcomer to the industry, but when it comes to features, it’s certainly no small fry. Available for both Android and iOS, Umobix sports a clean, modern, and easy-to-use interface and a robust set of features that will allow you to keep your children safe at all times.
 
Made specifically for keeping teenagers safe, Umobix focuses on the basics. Instead of offering a wide array of peripheral features that teenagers may or may not use, the app centers its attention on channels that teenagers use to interact and communicate with the internet, including Snapchat.
 
Umobix is one of the best alternatives to mSpy to help you protect your children from the worst-case scenarios. 
 
In the next section, I’ll discuss Umobix’ main features.
 
A good parental control app needs to have a robust set of monitoring and tracking features, and Umobix has all of the basics covered quite well.
 
For monitoring, this Snapchat spy app can keep track of more than just Snapchat. It can also track the target phone’s call history, text messages, browser history, and video/photo files. 
 
Umobix is pretty thorough when it comes to monitoring, as it will show even deleted call history and browser history. It also has advanced filters and sorting capabilities when displaying the results.
 
That isn’t all, because Umobix also allows you access to your teen’s social life. It can monitor the most popular social media apps and instant messaging apps, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, and of course, Snapchat. 
 
That said, the apps available vary greatly between Android and iOS, with Android having more trackable apps than iOS.
 
For the ultimate monitoring function, the app also features a keylogger that allows you to see every stroke that your teen has ever typed on their phone. If they’ve been chatting with random strangers on Snapchat, for instance, then you’ll know every detail of what they said with this feature.
 
Lastly, Umobix’s GPS tracking function also allows you to keep your child safe in the physical world by letting you know where they are. No need to wait for them to hashtag their location on Snapchat or Instagram!
 
If you want to read more about uMobix, check out our extensive review.
 
Umobix is available for both Android and iOS devices, although functionalities vary between both, especially when it comes to tracking social media and messaging apps. Sadly, the Snapchat feature is only available on Android.
 
In fact, Umobix for iOS has a pretty limited capability when it comes to app monitoring. It can only track Facebook, Instagram, Skype, Whatsapp, and Messenger, as opposed to the Android version, which can track all popular social media and instant messaging apps, including Snapchat, TikTok, Viber, and even Telegram.
 
Umobix subscription prices differ a bit between Android and iPhone, although they both have four price tiers and two packages.
 
For Android, prices start with the 1-month Basic package at $29.99 a month, followed by the 1-month Full package at $59.99 a month, a 3-month Full package at $33.33 a month, and finally a 12-month Full package at $14.99 a month.
 
For iPhones, prices start with the 1-month Basic package at $29.99 a month, followed by the 1-month Full package at $49.99 a month, a 3-month Full package at $26.66 a month, and finally a 12-month Full package at $12.49 a month.
 
If you want a full-featured app to protect your children, get Umobix now.
 
#### How To Spy On Someone’s Snapchat with Umobix
 
Now, let’s learn how to monitor the target device’s Snapchat account using Umobix. Since you need to subscribe to use the app’s services, this tutorial assumes that you have already subscribed, downloaded, and installed Umobix on the target device.
 
- Once you have Umobix installed, go to the Umobix User Space.
 - Enter your credentials and log in.
 - You will then enter your dashboard, where you will see the target device’s general status.
 - On the upper-right-hand corner of your dashboard, click the icon with three uneven lines, next to the hamburger icon.
 - You will then be presented with this options menu.
 - Scroll down to see the Snapchat option and click it to monitor the target device’s Snapchat account.
 - On the tab, you will then see a summary of the target device’s Snapchat account and its activities. If it’s online, you will see a green bar that says “Snapchat is online now.”

 
### Using Eyezy
 
Eyezy is the third app with parental controls on this list and it fits right in. When it comes to thorough spy apps, look no further than Eyezy. It has a wide range of features that you can use to protect your child from some of the dangers on the internet. 
 
In this section, we will look at Eyezy’s main features, compatibility, pricing, and how to use it. If you’re interested in a more in-depth review, look at our Eyezy review.
 
Eyezy is a force when it comes to parental control apps, that’s because it offers an impressive feature set that goes beyond merely social media monitoring. 
 
Eyezy’s are separated into different categories. The Keystroke Capture category features a keylogger and a screen recorder. You can view whatever your child types and see random screenshots of their phone screen. 
 
The next category is Social Spotlight. This is what will allow you to view Snapchat messages and contacts. This feature also allows you to view not just Snapchat but also emails, text messages, WhatsApp, Instagram DMs, Telegram messages, and more. 
 
The Phone Analyzer allows you to view your child’s contacts and phone calls. For standard location services, Eyezy has a Pinpoint Category that allows you to view the GPS location of your child. It also allows you to view the WiFi networks they’re connected to or have been connected to. 
 
With Files Finder, you can view the media on your child’s device as well as the installed apps. Web Magnifier handles browser history and bookmarks, while Connection Blocker allows you to block your child from using inappropriate apps, going on certain websites, or even connecting to Wi-Fi networks. 
 
Lastly, the Magic Alerts category contains keyword tracking so you can be notified when specific words are used. It also has a geofencing feature that tells you when your child has left designated safe zones. 
 
#### Compatibility 
 
Eyezy is available for both Android and iOS.  Android devices can utilize all of Eyezy’s features, especially the Social Spotlight that allows you to spy on Snapchat.  However, iOS devices are limited in what Eyezy can access. 
 
Jailbroken iOS devices allow for some of the features from Social Spotlight, however, it’s only limited to Tinder, WhatsApp, and text messages. If you’re looking for more access to your child’s iOS devices then check out these spy apps for non-jailbroken iPhones. 
 
A workaround would be the fact that the Keylogger and Screen recording features are active on both iOS and Android devices. These may give you an insight into the type of messages your child is receiving on Snapchat. 
 
Eyezy charges you per device. The price of its plans are as follows:
 
- 1 Month  $68.56
 - 3 Months – $119.96
 - 6 Months – $154.20Snapchat app
 - 12 Months – $171.26

 
Eyezy is somewhat pricier than other spy apps on the market, however, given its features, it’s understandable.
 
#### How To Spy On Someone’s Snapchat With Eyezy
 
Here’s how to use it to monitor Snapchat on your child’s mobile phone. This tutorial skips the initial setup steps, as it assumes you’ve already purchased a subscription plan and linked the target phone to your account. 
 
- Go to Eyezy’s website and log into your Eyezy account.

 
- Once you’re logged in, you’ll be brought to the dashboard of the target phone. To the left of your screen, you’ll see the categories of features that Eyezy has available. Click Social Spotlight to expand the list.

 
- From the expanded list, you’ll see all the social media apps that Eyezy covers, click Snapchat.

 
- Once you’ve clicked Snapchat, you’ll see the last messages your child sent/received since you’ve installed Eyezy on their phone. Click the message thread that you want to view.

 
- Now you can view those messages as well as any new messages that your child shares. It’s important to note that you won’t have access to the full message history as Snapchat often deletes its messages.

 
For a video demonstration, here’s how to view Snapchat messages with Eyezy:
 
Download Eyezy and see what’s happening on the Snapchat app. 
 
### Using Other Methods Besides Spy Apps
 
If you’re wondering “do I have to use a spy app to monitor my child’s Snapchat?”  The answer is no. There are simpler ways to be your child’s phone monitor without employing the use of any apps.
 
#### Have A Conversation About Online Safety
 
While Snapchat can be fun for kids to talk to their friends and enjoy funny filters, it can also be an avenue for harm. This harm can come from strangers or even people they know. 
 
Talk to your children about online safety. Let them know that while Snapchat may have a disappearing feature, what they share there and on other social media platforms can exist online forever. Recipients can save snaps and send them to their other people. Have an honest conversation with them so they’re more careful about what they share online. 
 
#### Assist Your Children In Choosing The Right Settings
 
One of the benefits of Snapchat and many social media platforms is that they have helpful privacy settings. These settings can help your child choose who is able to contact them, who is able to view their story, and their location. They can also block strangers and make it so that they can only speak to their friends.
 
## Now You Know How To Monitor Snapchat
 
Maybe you’re a concerned parent who doesn’t want your children to be taken advantage of. Maybe you’re an employer who doesn’t want company devices to be used for things not related to the company business. Regardless of who you are, sometimes, it’s necessary to snoop into someone’s Snapchat account. 
 
### Is There An App To Spy On Snapchat?
 
You can spy on another person’s Snapchat activities through spy apps. I recommend 3 spy apps in particular: mSpy, Umobix, and Eyezy. These apps allow you to monitor the target device’s Snapchat activity quite easily, as well as other things, such as GPS tracking.
 
### Can You Spy On Snapchat For Free?
 
There are apps that will advertise themselves as free Snapchat trackers. However, most of them are scams and viruses. If you want to spy on someone’s Snapchat using a reliable method, you can use Umobix, mSpy, or Eyezy. However, you have to pay a price for their reliability.
 
### Can You Spy on Someone’s Snapchat Without Them Knowing?
 
You can spy on someone’s Snapchat account without their knowledge through the use of spy apps such as Umobix, mSpy, and Eyezy. They will be installed discreetly on the device that you want to monitor and be hidden away by clever programming so the target won’t know.
 
That said, do take note that while it may be completely legal to use monitoring apps on your kids’ devices or on company devices, it’s still better to check your local laws beforehand to be safe.
 
Once you’ve determined that it’s okay based on local laws, you can spy on someone’s Snapchat without them noticing through the use of spy apps such as mSpy, Umobix, and Eyezy. These three are some of the most popular Snapchat spy apps in the market. Through them, you can monitor your target’s Snapchat account without the target knowing.
