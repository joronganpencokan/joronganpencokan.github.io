Transform Your Computer Experience with Whatsapp - Here's How to Install and Use it on Your Windows PC!

If you're a regular Whatsapp user, you know the joy of staying connected with your friends and family, no matter where you are. With the ability to send messages, make voice and video calls, and share files, Whatsapp has completely changed the way we communicate. But did you know that you can use Whatsapp on your Windows PC too? In this article, we'll tell you how to install and use Whatsapp on your computer and enjoy the same seamless experience as on your phone.

Step 1: Download and Install Whatsapp on Your Computer

To use Whatsapp on your computer, you'll need to download the desktop app from the official website. Simply go to whatsapp.com/download and click on the 'Download for Windows' button. Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install the app.

Step 2: Set Up Your Whatsapp Account on Your Computer

Once you have installed the app, open it on your computer. You'll see a QR code on the screen. Now, open Whatsapp on your phone, go to 'Settings,' select 'Whatsapp Web,' and scan the QR code with your phone's camera to link your account. Once the QR code is scanned, you'll see your Whatsapp chats on your computer screen.

Step 3: Enjoy Using Whatsapp on Your Computer

Now that you have installed and set up Whatsapp on your computer, you can use it just like you do on your phone. You can send text messages, make voice and video calls, and share files with your contacts. The desktop app also allows you to customize your notifications and customize your keyboard shortcuts for a personalized experience.

Benefits of Using Whatsapp on Your Windows PC

Using Whatsapp on your Windows PC offers several benefits:

1. Bigger Screen: You can enjoy chatting with your contacts on a bigger screen, which makes it easier to read messages and follow conversations.

2. Easier Typing: Typing on a physical keyboard is faster and easier than typing on a virtual keyboard.

3. Better Productivity: With Whatsapp on your computer, you can stay connected with your contacts while working on your computer without the need to switch between devices or apps.

Conclusion

Using Whatsapp on your Windows PC offers a seamless experience and makes communication with your contacts even more convenient. All you need is to download and install the desktop app, set up your account, and start chatting with your contacts on your computer. So, transform your computer experience with Whatsapp and enjoy the same great features wherever you go.

If you are a iPhone, Android, Blackberry or Windows Phone user, you might be familiar with the WhatsApp application that allows you to chat and send free SMS with your friends. It is such a useful app, to the extend that it has completely replaced my default SMS app. WhatsApp is tied to your mobile number and that is why it can only be used on a mobile device. What if you want to use it on your Windows desktop? Here’s how to do so.

For this tutorial, we’ll be using a free app call Bluestacks to install the Android version of WhatsApp on your Windows desktop. If you are using a Mac, you can also check out the Bluestacks for Mac, though it is pretty new and doesn’t support as many apps as the Windows version.
 
1. Download and install Bluestacks for Windows.
 

 
2. Install the WhatsApp application in Bluestacks (it usually appears in the sidebar. If not, you can search for it in the search bar).
 
3. Once installed, click on the WhatsApp application to launch it.
 
Click the “Agree and Continue” button to proceed.
 
4. Enter your country and mobile number.
 
When it prompts you to verify the mobile number, click OK.
 
5. Sit back and wait as it tries to verify your account. It should fail since your desktop doesn’t come with the capability to receive SMS. Once the verification failed, it will give you a “Call me” option to verify your account. Click “Call Me”. Remember to have your mobile phone by your side to receive the call.
 
6. Once the verification is completed, you will be able to use WhatsApp to chat and send free SMS with your friends on your desktop. 
 
The bad thing about this is that WhatsApp can only run on one platform at any one time. If you are using WhatsApp on your desktop, it is best to turn off the Internet connection on your mobile so the WhatsApp on your mobile is not operating. Another thing is that the chat log is not synced over the server, so your chat log on your desktop won’t appear in your mobile. This will definitely lead to a break in the conversation thread.
