# REVEALED: The Secret Trick to Mirroring Your iPhone on a Samsung TV - No Expensive Cables Needed!

If you own an iPhone and a Samsung TV, you may want to use the latter to display content from the former. However, mirroring your iPhone on a Samsung TV is not as simple as it could be, especially since Apple and Samsung use different technologies for their devices.

While there are many ways to mirror your iPhone on a Samsung TV, most of them involve buying expensive cables or adapters that may or may not work. But fear not, as we have discovered a secret trick that will allow you to mirror your iPhone on a Samsung TV without any costly accessories.

The first thing you need to do is to make sure that your Samsung TV and iPhone are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. This is crucial, as it will enable them to communicate with each other. You can check your Wi-Fi connection on your iPhone by going to Settings > Wi-Fi, and on your Samsung TV by going to Settings > Network.

Once you have confirmed that both devices are on the same network, go to the Control Center on your iPhone by swiping down from the top-right corner of the screen (for iPhones with Face ID) or up from the bottom of the screen (for iPhones with Touch ID). Then, tap on Screen Mirroring and select your Samsung TV from the list of available devices.

If you don't see your Samsung TV on the list, make sure that the Screen Mirroring feature is enabled on it. You can do this by pressing the Home button on your Samsung TV remote, going to Settings > General > Network > Screen Mirroring, and turning it on.

Once you have selected your Samsung TV, your iPhone screen will be mirrored on it. You can then use your iPhone to play videos, music, or display photos, and they will appear on your Samsung TV.

The secret trick to mirroring your iPhone on a Samsung TV without expensive cables is AirPlay 2. AirPlay 2 is a wireless technology developed by Apple that allows you to stream content from your iPhone to compatible devices, including Samsung TVs.

To use AirPlay 2, you need to make sure that your Samsung TV supports it. Most Samsung TVs released in 2019 and later support AirPlay 2, but you can check if your TV is compatible by going to the Samsung support website and searching for your model.

If your Samsung TV is compatible with AirPlay 2, you can use it to mirror your iPhone screen without any cables. Simply follow the same steps as before to connect your iPhone and Samsung TV to the same Wi-Fi network, go to the Control Center on your iPhone, and select your Samsung TV from the list of available devices.

With AirPlay 2, you can also use your Samsung TV as a speaker for your iPhone. If you're listening to music on your iPhone, you can select your Samsung TV as the output device and enjoy your music through its speakers.

In conclusion, mirroring your iPhone on a Samsung TV doesn't have to be a complicated or expensive process. By using AirPlay 2, you can easily display content from your iPhone on a Samsung TV without the need for any cables or adapters. So, try out this secret trick today and enjoy your iPhone content on your Samsung TV with ease!
