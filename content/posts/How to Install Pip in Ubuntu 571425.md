# Unlock The Secret To Easy Python Installations- Learn How To Install Pip In Ubuntu Now!

Python is a high-level programming language that is easy to learn, read and write. It is used for various applications such as web development, data analysis, scientific computing, and machine learning, etc. One of its most significant advantages is the availability of a large number of libraries and modules that are widely used in the industry today. To manage these libraries and modules, Python uses a package manager called "pip." 

In this article, we will discuss how to install "pip" in Ubuntu, which is a popular Linux distribution.

## What is Pip?

Pip is a package manager for Python that allows us to install, upgrade, and manage Python packages and libraries easily. It is a command-line tool that comes pre-installed with Python versions 2.7.9 and later versions, including 3.4 and higher. Pip is used to download and install external libraries for Python that are not included in the standard library.

## Installing Pip in Ubuntu

Unfortunately, pip is not pre-installed in Ubuntu. However, it can be installed in a few simple steps.

Step 1: Open the terminal by pressing "Ctrl + Alt + T" or launch it from the applications menu.

Step 2: Update the package lists by running the following command:
```
sudo apt-get update
```
This command will update the package lists making sure that you are installing the latest version of Pip.

Step 3: Install pip by running the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
This command installs the pip package for Python version 3.x, which is the default version of Python on Ubuntu systems. If you want to install pip for Python 2.x or another version, replace "python3-pip" with "python-pip" or "python2-pip".

Step 4: Verify that pip was installed successfully by running the following command:
```
pip3 --version
```
This command should display the version of pip along with the version of Python that is currently installed on your system.

## Using Pip to Install Python Packages

Now that pip is installed, we can use it to install Python packages easily. Here's an example:

Step 1: Open the terminal and type the following command:
```
pip3 install matplotlib
```
This command installs the "matplotlib" package, which is a popular data visualization library. You can install any package or library using pip by replacing "matplotlib" with the name of the package you want to install.

Step 2: Verify that the package was installed successfully by running the following command:
```
python3 -c "import matplotlib"
```
If the package was installed correctly, this command will execute without giving any error.

## Conclusion

Pip is an essential tool for Python development, and installing it in Ubuntu is a straightforward process. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily install pip in Ubuntu and start installing packages and libraries for your Python projects. Pip is a powerful tool that makes Python development significantly easier, so take advantage of it and start exploring the vast world of Python modules and libraries.

Linux is absolutely rife with package managers. Not only does Ubuntu have apt, but many programming languages come with their own package managers as well. Node.js has npm, Ruby has gem, and Python has pip.
 
Pip stands for Python Installs Packages and lets you easily install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI). You can use it to install from other indexes as well, but much of what you’ll generally need is available on PyPI. In order to use pip to install packages, you’ll need to install it on your system first.
 
## Which Version of Pip Do You Need?
 
If you’re at all familiar with Python, you likely know that Python 3 has been out for a long time. Even so, because of major changes between Python 2 and Python 3, many Linux distributions include both versions by default. Because of this, there are also two versions of pip.
 
Newer versions of Ubuntu only come with Python 3 installed by default. If you need pip for Python 2, you’ll need to install Python 2 as well.
 
Which version you need likely depends on the package you need to install. Either way, the process is relatively easy, but we’ll show you how to install both versions so you know exactly what to do.
 
## How to Install Pip for Python 3
 
The first thing to do before you get started is to make sure that your package list is up to date. Do this by running apt:
 
This process will take a little time. Once it is complete, you can move on to actually installing pip. To do this, run the following command:
 
Confirm that you want to install the packages, and wait for the process to complete. Once this is finished, confirm that the package installed correctly by checking the version:
 
## How to Install Pip for Python 2
 
As mentioned above, if you need pip for Python 2, you need to install Python 2 as well. This is easy, though, as Python 2 will be installed as a dependency for pip.
 
First, make sure your package list is up to date:
 
Once this is complete, you can install pip with the following command:
 
Confirm that you want to install pip and its dependencies, then wait for the installation to complete. Once this is finished, make sure everything installed properly by checking the version:
 
## Should You Use Pip or Apt?
 
In some cases you’ll find that packages are available in both the Python Package Index and via Apt. If you have to choose, you’re better off sticking with installing via Apt, as these versions have been tested to work on Ubuntu. In most cases you’ll only want to use pip if a package isn’t available via Apt or if you need a specific version.
 
## Conclusion
 
It’s worth noting that you may need to install pip for both Python 2 and Python 3. Some packages are only available for certain python versions, and other software may rely on one or both. Neovim, for example, lets users create add-ons in both Python 2 and Python 3 and relies on having its own package installed in both versions of pip.
 
Chances are good that you’re installing pip because you’re a developer. If this is the case, be sure to check out our list of the best Python IDEs.
