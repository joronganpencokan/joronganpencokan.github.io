# Shocking Goose Goose Duck S Revealed: The Incredible Lore Behind The Epic Game You Never Knew!

Goose Goose Duck S, a game that has taken the internet by storm, is a multiplayer game of deception and intrigue. Players are assigned different roles, and their goal is to either identify and eliminate an imposter, or to deceive the crew and carry out their nefarious deeds. However, what many players may not know is that the game has a rich and fascinating backstory that adds depth to the gameplay.

The game takes place on a spaceship named the SS Walrus, which is on a mission to explore the galaxy. The crew is made up of different characters, each with their own backstory, that have been chosen to undertake this dangerous mission. However, as they journey through the galaxy, they encounter a mysterious being known only as "The Goose."

The Goose is a creature from another dimension that has the power to possess and control other beings. It had been on a mission to conquer other worlds, but was forced to flee after being defeated by a powerful entity. However, it managed to escape and stumbled upon the SS Walrus. It saw the potential of the ship's crew and decided to take advantage of their weaknesses by possessing one of their own and infiltrating the crew.

The possessed crew member, now known as the imposter, must sabotage the ship and eliminate the crew without getting caught. The other players, who are unaware of the imposter's identity, must work together to identify and eliminate the threat before it's too late.

As the game progresses, players will uncover different pieces of the game's lore through various tasks and missions. They will uncover the Goose's true intentions and learn about the other entities that inhabit the galaxy. These entities include the space whales, who are giant creatures that live in the vast reaches of space, and the mysterious Black Hole Cult, who worship the power of the black holes and seek to harness their power.

Players can also unlock different cosmetic items that showcase their knowledge of the game's lore, such as the "Space Whale Plushie" or the "Black Hole Hat." These items add an extra layer of fun and customization to the game and allow players to show off their dedication to the storytelling behind the game.

In conclusion, Goose Goose Duck S is not just a game of deception and intrigue, but also a rich and fascinating world filled with interesting characters and lore. As players continue to explore the depths of space, they will uncover new secrets and unravel the mystery behind The Goose's true intentions. So why not join the crew of the SS Walrus and see what kind of adventures await you in this incredible game?

Goose Goose Duck has quickly become one of the most played massively multiplayer games after Among Us. One of the reasons for its popularity is due to a BTS star. One of the members of the popular Korean band live streamed the game back in November 2022. Since then, the game has created an insane amount of hype. It is pretty obvious that the game’s core focus is a cold war battle between the ducks and geese. But what players don’t know is the events that took place that ignited the fight. This guide will show you the lore story behind Goose Goose Duck.
 
## What’s the Lore Storyline Behind Goose Goose Duck
 

From the start of the official game trailer, we are shown that there was an unknown conflict between the geese and ducks. That was put to rest when both of them signed a peace treaty. But that was only for the time being! As soon as the geese launched a space program, a general duck appears to get infuriated. He then proceeds to send in duck agents who are disguised as geese. This eventually leads to the undercover ducks committing the merciless and endless killing of geese. We don’t know for sure the exact reason behind this. But there is some lore in Goose Goose Duck that supports it.
 

 
There are two sides to every story. While the game portrays the ducks as the villains, we have no idea what or who started the dispute. We can assume that it was a small misunderstanding blown out of proportion or culture differences that led to heated exchanges. Or it was probably a classic love story that strained the relationship between the ducks and geese forever. Well, these are just presumptions. It remains to be seen what exactly took place that led to this day.
