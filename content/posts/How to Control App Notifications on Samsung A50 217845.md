# Samsung A50 Notification Overload? Here's The Ultimate Guide To Take Control Like A Pro!

Smartphones have made our lives more convenient than ever before. While they allow us to stay connected with the world, they also come with an overwhelming number of notifications that can be distracting at times. If you're a Samsung A50 user dealing with notification overload, this guide will show you how to take control like a pro.

## Prioritize Notifications

First of all, it's essential to prioritize notifications. This means that you have to choose which apps are critical and which are okay to ignore. To do this, go to "Settings," then "Notifications." From there, you can select the apps that you want to receive notifications from. If you don't want to receive notifications from a particular app, toggle the switch next to it to the "off" position.

## Group Notifications

If you're receiving notifications from multiple apps, it can be helpful to group them together. This way, you'll receive a single notification for multiple events--for example, one notification for three emails. To set this up, go to "Settings," then "Notifications," and choose "Advanced Settings." From there, you'll see the "Notification grouping" option. Toggle it on, and your notifications will be automatically grouped by the app that they come from.

## Customize Notification Tones

Different notifications can have different tones to help you identify them quickly. You can also assign different notification tones to different people or apps. To do this, go to "Settings," then "Sounds and Vibration," and select "Ringtone." From there, you can choose your default ringtone and notification tone or create a custom tone for a specific app or contact.

## Silence Notifications

Sometimes, you may want to mute your phone's notifications entirely, such as during an important meeting or while you're sleeping. Samsung A50 has a Do Not Disturb mode that allows you to mute notifications or customize them depending on the app or contact. To activate it, go to "Settings," then "Notifications," and choose "Do Not Disturb." From there, you can schedule when you want the mode to turn on or have it activated instantly by toggling on "Turn On Now."

## Conclusion

Notifications are an essential feature of Samsung A50, but they can be overwhelming at times. By customizing your preferences, you can take control of your notifications like a pro. Try experimenting with different settings and options until you find what works best for you. With a little tweaking, you can have a less distracting, more productive smartphone experience.
