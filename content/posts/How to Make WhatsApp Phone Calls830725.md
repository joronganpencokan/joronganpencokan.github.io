# Revolutionize Your Communication - Unlock the Secrets of Making WhatsApp Phone Calls!

In today's digital age, communication is progressing at a breakneck pace. With the advent of technology, people are now able to communicate faster and more efficiently than ever. One of the most revolutionary forms of digital communication is WhatsApp, the instant messaging app used by more than 2 billion people worldwide. WhatsApp is a multi-functional platform that offers texting, voice messaging, video calling, and even phone calls. However, the WhatsApp phone call feature is an underutilized tool that can transform the way we communicate. 

WhatsApp's phone call feature is advantageous because it does not require regular phone services or landlines. Instead, it uses internet data to make voice calls, which means you can make phone calls from anywhere in the world, as long as you have an internet connection. This feature is particularly useful for long-distance calls and international communication. Also, WhatsApp phone calls are free to use, which makes them economical and saves money on phone bills. 

But why limit yourself to just voice calls when WhatsApp offers so much more? Try out the video calling feature in WhatsApp to elevate your communication game. With the video calling feature, you can connect with your friends and family face-to-face, regardless of distance. Moreover, seeing the facial expressions and gestures of the person you're talking to improves your communication and strengthens your connection. 

Another advantage of WhatsApp's phone call and video calling features is that they guarantee secure conversations. WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption, which means only the person you are communicating with can access the messages and calls. This security feature protects your conversations from hacks, scams, and frauds. 

To take full advantage of WhatsApp's calling features, you need to know the basics of making phone calls on WhatsApp. Here's how you can accomplish it: 

1. Open the WhatsApp application 
2. Select the contact you want to call 
3. Tap on the call icon 
4. Choose between voice and video call 

It's that simple! You can add a personal touch to your calls by using customized ringtones or personalized contact names. Furthermore, you can use WhatsApp's conference calling feature to communicate with multiple people at once, making it perfect for group projects, business meetings, or family gatherings. 

In conclusion, if you're looking to upgrade your communication game, WhatsApp's phone call and video call features are a perfect tool to achieve that. They provide a secure, economical, and efficient mode of communication that can revolutionize the way you connect with people. Make sure to get educated on the basics of WhatsApp's calling feature and unlock the secrets of digital communication.

##   How to Make a Call on WhatsApp  
 

WhatsApp uses data rather than cellular voice services to place text messages and voice calls. That means you can use it even if you are traveling internationally or are somewhere without cellular service. In fact, WhatsApp is popular among international travelers who rely on WhatsApp to avoid buying international data plans.

 

As long as you have a Wi-Fi connection, you can place a WhatsApp call. If you do not have Wi-Fi, though, WhatsApp will use data from your mobile plan, which might result in data charges.

 

On the other hand, WhatsApp is also simple to use, since it relies on your existing address book and doesn’t require you to find people by usernames or email addresses.

 
- Start the WhatsApp app.
 - If you’re not already on the Calls page, tap Calls at the top of the screen.
 - Tap the Call button, which is the green phone icon at the bottom of the screen.
 - Find the person whom you want to call from your contacts list. The WhatsApp contact list which you see here is actually your phone’s default contacts list. If you don’t see the person you want to call, you can tap New contact and add the individual to your contact list. You’ll need to enter the person’s phone number in the new contact entry since WhatsApp uses phone numbers to identify users.
 - What you find the person you want to call, tap the phone icon to the right of their name. If the person is able to receive a call and answers, the call has begun. From here, it works like a phone call using any messaging or phone app.

 

If a contact calls you, you can accept or reject an incoming call. To accept the call, swipe the green phone button. You can reject the call by swiping the red button, or decline the call with a short text reply by swiping the text button.

When you see an incoming WhatsApp group voice or video call, and you can't join the call at that moment, tap Ignore. The active call will appear in your Calls tab in the WhatsApp app.

 

When you're able to join the group call, tap the active call, then tap Join to join in on the call.
