Are you looking for an easy and secure way to access important files on a USB or external hard drive when away from home? The HooToo TripMate Nano is a small portable device that can do just that. The HooToo website explains it best when it says that the TripMate Nano “is a portable wireless network router and personal cloud in the palm of your hand.”
 
Below you can see its size compared to a Moto G Android phone. You can also see the ports along with the switch button, which can be used to set up the Nano as a media-sharing device, access point, router or bridge.
 
The TripMate Nano can be used in many different scenarios. For this review, let’s imagine that you’re at a friend’s house or a hotel with a public, unsecured WiFi connection. You want to watch some videos or access important documents on your USB via your smartphone or tablet, but you’re worried about your privacy and security.
 
The TripMate Nano is the perfect solution because you can use it to create your own private Internet connection by creating a secure access point. From there, your friends or family can also connect to your private sharing zone and access your files as well, but only if you choose to share the password with them.
 
Let’s take a look at how this would be done.
 
## Setting Up and Powering On the TripMate Nano
 
The TripMate Nano is very easy to get connected and running. First you can insert your USB drive (or an external hard drive) into the USB port on the device. Next you can attach an ethernet cable and finally, the USB cable. The micro USB side of the cable goes into the Nano and the USB side goes into a USB port on your laptop.
 
Once your laptop is powered on, you should see a solid blue light on top of the Nano letting you know that it is connected to the Internet.
 
## Connecting to the TripMate Nano and Configuration
 
Now that the TripMate is connected to a wired network, you can transform that into a wireless network. You’ll need to connect to the “TripMateNano-xxxx” connection on your mobile device under WiFi networks (in Settings). For the password, enter eight number ones – 11111111 (this can be changed later). You should now be connected.
 
If you’re not prompted to sign in, you should open a browser on your device and go to the admin setup page at “10.10.10.254” (if you’re not directed there automatically). The user name may already be filled in; if not, it’s “admin.” The password should remain blank. Now you can log in and further configure the Nano.
 
There are many settings in the admin dashboard, but what’s most important is that you have the Internet set to “wireless access” and have your public SSID and password entered (if needed) so that you can get Internet access. To do that, tap on “Network.”
 
Now tap on “Internet” in the side menu. Tap on the arrow button in the SSID field, and your public connection should show up. Select it and enter a password if required. For an unlocked public network, there won’t be a password, so you can leave it blank. Click on the “Save” button, and now you should have Internet access on your device.
 
## Accessing Files With the TripMate Nano App
 
All that’s left now is to download the TripMate Nano app. It’s available on iOS and Android. The app can be used to browse and delete files on a connected USB or hard drive. Plus, it also works as an internal file manager for your device. The app is very easy to use and navigate, so you shouldn’t have any issues.
 
You can also change your Nano’s device name and security options in Settings. There’s even a firmware upgrade option so that you can keep your Nano up to date.
 
### Pros
 
- Size and portability: it weighs just 1 ounce and can fit just about anywhere – pocket, purse, backpack, laptop bag.Universal access: can be used with your smartphone, tablet or laptop.Easily accessible by those connected to your wireless network: anyone can download and access files on a connected USB as long as you provide them access.Easy to configure: the mobile app makes it easy to configure your Tripmate and access all of the content on a connected storage device.

 
### Cons
 
- No internal battery: needs to be connected via USB at all times.Tricky setup process: the set up process can be a little tricky and lengthy.

 
## Final Thoughts
 
The HooToo TripMate Nano is the perfect device for those who do a lot of traveling or work away from home in places with wired Internet access. If you’re worried about privacy and want an easy way to securely access videos, images, audio and documents while on the go, the Nano may be the way to go.
