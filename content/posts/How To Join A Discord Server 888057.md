# Joining a Discord Server - The One Secret Nobody Knows (Until Now!)

Discord is a popular chat platform among gamers and various communities. It is an excellent way to stay connected and interact with other people who share similar interests. Discord has many features and tools that make it easy to use and explore, but joining a new server can be intimidating for many people.

In this article, we will share a secret with you that nobody knows when it comes to joining a Discord server. This secret may help you have a better and more enjoyable experience.

## The Secret Nobody Knows

The secret we're talking about is that you can join a Discord server without feeling intimidated. You don't have to be perfect, and you don't have to know anyone there. You only need to be kind, respectful and follow the server's rules.

When you join a new server, take a moment to read through the rules and guidelines. These rules can help you understand what is expected from you and what you can expect from others. You can also check the server's description to learn more about the server's purpose and your role within the server.

## Be Yourself

It can be tempting to try to be someone you're not when joining a new Discord server. However, it is better to be yourself. Users are more likely to connect with you if you are genuine and authentic.

Don't worry about fitting in or impressing others. Be confident and comfortable with who you are. Talk about your interests, hobbies or what you do in your free time. You never know who you might connect with.

## Connect With Others

When you join a new server, take some time to observe other users and how they interact. You can learn a lot about the community from how people behave and treat one another.

Introduce yourself to people you find interesting or have something in common. Start a conversation, ask questions, or participate in group activities. Don't be afraid to get involved and share your ideas.

## Conclusion

Joining a Discord server can be intimidating, but it doesn't have to be. Use the tips above to help you feel more at ease and confident when joining a new server. Remember, be yourself, follow the server's rules, and connect with others. Discord is a fantastic way to meet new people, learn new things, and have fun. So, what are you waiting for?

Discord servers are like a community where all the members can communicate via text, call, video, and they can even share the screen with each other. Servers are a great place to find new friends, as by joining a discord server, you can find similar minded people with similar interest. And these members can be assigned different roles on the server. A user on discord is allowed to join a maximum of 100 servers, and these servers can be for particular games like PUBG or Fortnite or for anything else.
 
As soon as someone creates an account on Discord, the first thing they do is join an existing server according to their interest. But few people may find the process a bit confusing. So we decided to come up with this article to clear up that confusion for PC/Mac as well as for the Android and iOS devices.
 
## Join A Discord Server
 
It isn’t that hard, and it can be done in two ways:
 
With an Invitation Link: To join a discord server, all you need is an invitation of that server, which you have received from a friend, or from any existing member of that server.
 
Discovering new Servers: If you don’t have the server link, even then you can Discover/Find the servers by yourself, and join the community.
 
(Note: The Steps for Windows and Mac are exactly the same, so you can perform the steps given below on any of the platforms)
 
### With An Invitation Link
 
Joining a server on Discord is really easy if you have the invitation link of that particular server. You just need to follow these steps to do so.
 
1. Launch the Discord desktop app on your PC or Mac. If you don’t have the desktop app, then you can log into discord on your Web browser.
 
2. After logging in, you’ll directly be on your home page. Now click on the + icon on the extreme left side of the Discord screen.
 
3. Now click on “Join a server”.
 
4. At last, paste the invitation link of that server and click on “Join.”
 
(Note: If you’ve got the invitation link from a friend on Discord itself, then you just have to go to that friend’s chat to find that link. After that you’ll see a “Join” button on the right side of that link.)
 

 
That’s it, now enjoy being a member of that server.
 
### Discover New Servers To Join
 
If you want to join different servers but haven’t got an invitation link to join them, then you can discover new servers by following these simple steps.
 
1. Log into your Discord account on the Desktop app or on the web browser.

4. After getting the related results, take your cursor on any desired server and click on “View.”
 
5. Now you’ll get to the welcome page of that server. Finally, Click on the “Join Server” button, which you can find at the bottom of the screen. You can also click on the “Back to Discovery” button if you want to look for other servers.
