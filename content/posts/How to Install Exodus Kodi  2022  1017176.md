Exodus is a third-party Kodi addon that allows you to stream or watch movies, tv-series, or content online. Exodus is probably one of the oldest and well-known add-ons for Kodi, which is is why this add-on is reliable, and there are regular updates available for this add-on. Now the add-on doesn’t have its own server to host the media files as it simply links the media content on other platforms to Kodi.
 
Now a fair warning that most content available in Exodus is pirated and it is illegal to use Exodus add-on. This tutorial is only for educational purposes to test Exodus, and in no way, this should be used to stream or watch pirated material. If you still utilize Exodus, you are doing so on your own risk and can’t be held liable for any damages.
 

 
#### Protect Yourself While Streaming & Downloading
