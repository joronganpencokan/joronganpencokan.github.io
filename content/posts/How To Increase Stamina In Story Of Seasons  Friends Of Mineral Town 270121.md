# Unleash Your Farming Potential with These Surprising Tricks to Boost Stamina in Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town!

If you're an avid player of Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town (SoS: FoMT), you know how important stamina is in farming. The more you have, the more work you can do in a day. However, sometimes it can be challenging to keep your stamina high throughout the day. Luckily, there are several tricks you can use to boost your stamina and get the most out of your farm. Here are some of the most surprising ways to do it!

## 1. Eat the Right Foods

Food is the most important way to replenish your stamina in SoS: FoMT. However, not all foods are created equal. Some foods will give you more bang for your buck than others. For example, cooked recipes like curry rice or roasted mushrooms will give you more stamina than raw foods like apples or oranges. Additionally, some foods are better as snacks throughout the day, like bamboo shoots or flowers, which will give you a small boost without using up too much time.

## 2. Get Your Beauty Sleep

Sleeping is one of the most effective ways to boost your stamina. You'll wake up with full stamina and ready to tackle the day. However, getting enough sleep isn't always easy – there's so much to do on the farm! To make sure you're getting enough sleep, make sure to plan your days out in advance. Set aside enough time to do all your farming work without sacrificing rest. Also, don't forget to upgrade your bed to get better quality sleep, allowing you to wake up with more stamina.

## 3. Drink Milk and Juice

Drinking milk and juice is another effective way to boost your stamina. Milk replenishes a lot of stamina instantly, while freshly squeezed juice restores a small amount gradually over time. Keep in mind that you'll want to drink these beverages at the appropriate time – for example, milk is best consumed in the morning, while juice is better throughout the day.

## 4. Take Advantage of the Hot Springs

The hot springs located on Mt. Moon is an excellent way to restore your stamina while enjoying a relaxing soak. Soak in the hot springs for ten minutes, and you'll be rewarded with increased stamina and even an added bonus to your maximum stamina level. Remember to wear a swimsuit and always bring soap to make the most out of your hot spring experience.

## 5. Use the Sauna

Another way to make use of the hot spring is by taking advantage of the sauna, located next to the mountainside villa. Sitting in the sauna for a few minutes will allow you to quickly restore your stamina. Additionally, the sauna will grant a slight boost to your maximum stamina level. It's a great option if you're on the go and need to replenish your stamina quickly.

In Conclusion

With these tips, you'll be able to boost your farming stamina in no time. Remember to eat the right foods, get enough sleep, drink milk and juice, take advantage of the hot springs, and use the sauna. You'll be able to get much more done on the farm without feeling depleted of energy. Happy farming!

Farming is a tiring job, especially if you have to transform it into a thriving field packed with crops. Moreover, you have to water them, harvest them and also care for livestock too. Doing work will reduce your stamina so it is important to know how to increase stamina in Story Of Seasons: Friends Of Mineral Town. Look no further, because this guide will tell you how to do it.
 
## How to Restore Stamina In Story Of Seasons: Friends Of Mineral Town
 
How much you can work with your tools will be determined by how much Stamina you have. As you use your tools, your stamina will decrease and if you keep working even more, you will end up overworking your body. With higher level tools, the energy used up will be higher.
 
You can keep an eye on how much stamina you have by checking out the berries on the top left area of the screen and the number near them. When your stamina gets depleted completely, you will enter the stage of fatigue. You will know each of these stages via the animation you see for your character. In order to avoid reaching this phase and stay active, here are some things you can do:
 
- Eat food: Make sure to eat food to keep your energy levels up. Elli leaves is the best food item for regaining stamina. But be careful of what you eat though, because not every food item is beneficial for you. Foods like Red Grass or the Poisonous Mushroom will end up causing the opposite of the desired effect. Eating them will reduce your stamina further.
 - Take some medicines: Some medicines that you can buy from a clinic will replenish some of your stamina but they are a bit expensive. If you don’t want to spend so much money, then you can opt for food items which provide similar results.
