As technology continues to evolve, so does our need for faster, more efficient ways to interact with the world around us. And while we may have come a long way from the days of bulky and slow desktop PCs, there is still a lot that can be done to make our machines even smarter.

One way to do this is by hacking Bluetooth connectivity into your PC, which can help you enjoy a range of benefits that you might otherwise miss out on. Whether you're looking to increase your productivity, enhance your entertainment experience, or simply stay connected to your devices, this hack is sure to give you the power you need.

So, how exactly does this hack work? Thankfully, getting Bluetooth up and running on your PC is a lot easier than you might think. Here are the basic steps:

## Step 1: Get Your Hands on a Bluetooth Adapter

The first thing you're going to need is a Bluetooth adapter, if your PC doesn't have one built-in already. These adapters come in all shapes and sizes, but most simply plug into a spare USB port on your computer. You can find these adapters at most electronics stores, or on online retailers like Amazon or Best Buy. Be sure to read reviews and check compatibility before making your purchase.

## Step 2: Install the Necessary Drivers

Once you have your Bluetooth adapter in hand, the next step is to install the necessary drivers that will help your PC communicate with it. Depending on the specific adapter you purchase, these drivers may come on a CD or may need to be downloaded from the manufacturer's website. Make sure you follow the installation instructions carefully, and reboot your PC if prompted to.

## Step 3: Pair Your Devices

Now that your PC is equipped with Bluetooth connectivity, it's time to start pairing your devices. This process varies based on the operating system and devices you are using, but generally involves putting your devices into pairing mode and searching for them from your PC. Once you've found the device you want to connect to, you'll typically be prompted to enter a PIN code or other authentication method to ensure a secure connection.

## Step 4: Enjoy Your Newfound Flexibility

With Bluetooth up and running on your PC, you now have access to a wide range of features that were previously unavailable. You can now wirelessly connect to your smartphone, tablet, or other devices, giving you the ability to stream media, transfer files, and even use your PC as a hands-free speakerphone. Additionally, many modern Bluetooth devices are equipped with voice-activated features, allowing you to control your music or give commands without having to touch your computer.

## Conclusion

By following these simple steps, you can transform your PC into a high-tech device that's packed full of features and capabilities. While it may take a bit of setup and adjustment, once you have Bluetooth connectivity up and running on your PC, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it. Whether you're looking to work more efficiently, stream media more easily, or simply stay connected to your devices no matter where you are, this hack is sure to unlock a whole new world of possibilities. So what are you waiting for? Get hacking and start enjoying the power of Bluetooth on your PC today!

While many PCs do have Bluetooth already built in, many don’t, especially older PCs. Plus, an older PC might not have the correct Bluetooth version necessary for the device you’re using. Either way, buying a Bluetooth adapter is an easy and affordable way to make your PC Bluetooth-ready without having to resort to upgrading to a brand new PC.
 
## Your Main Options
 
There are two main options to make your PC Bluetooth-ready. The easiest is a Bluetooth dongle or adapter. These are small USB adapters that usually install automatically when inserted. Some are roughly the size of the average USB flash drive, while others are barely larger than the USB portion itself. 
 
These work well as long as you have an available USB port. While USB-A is the most common type, there are some USB-C varieties available if your PC only has USB-C ports. Most of the time, you do need to insert these directly into your PC versus using a hub, but there are some exceptions to this rule.
 
Your other option is a Bluetooth PCIe card. Most of the time, these are actually wireless cards that also support Bluetooth, so you may end up replacing your existing wireless card. However, in an older PC, upgrading to a better wireless card doesn’t hurt. These cards slide inside an available slot in your computer. 
 
If you’re trying to add Bluetooth to a laptop, definitely go with the dongle, as it’s more compact and easier to install.
 
## Consider the Features
 
The single most important feature is choosing the Bluetooth version. It sounds simple enough to make your PC Bluetooth-ready, but different adapters and cards support different Bluetooth standards or versions. 
 
The current version at the time of writing is Bluetooth 5.2. The original 5.0 was released back in 2016. Each version adds new features. For instance, 5.2 improves upon low-energy audio, low-energy isochronous channel, and more. 
 
The good news is Bluetooth is backward compatible, so even if your device works with Bluetooth 3.0, a card or adapter with Bluetooth 5.2 would support it. For best results, opt for the highest version you can find. At the very least, opt for Bluetooth 5, as most newer devices use this version.
 
A few other things to consider include:
 
- The purpose – You’ll want a Bluetooth adapter or card that works with most any Bluetooth device. Some are designed only to work with specific devices, such as the adapter that comes with many wireless keyboards. Some adapters only work with audio devices, such as headphones and speakers. NFC compatibility – This isn’t a must, but it’s a nice feature to have if you’re syncing your smartphone and PC often. Check the range – Bluetooth has a much shorter range than Wi-Fi. The average range is around 30 feet. However, you can find some with ranges twice as much or more. Data transfer rates – Higher data transfer rates mean less latency when using multiple devices at once. Plus, if you’re using Bluetooth for audio, this helps reduce annoying latency that ruins your music.

 
## Best Bluetooth Dongles and Cards
 
In most cases, making your PC Bluetooth-ready is as simple as inserting the PCIe card or USB dongle. Windows typically recognizes and installs the necessary drivers automatically. However, always read the instructions that come with the Bluetooth device to ensure you’re installing it correctly. Some cards require you to connect a wire to the motherboard for Bluetooth functionality.
 
With so many options available, picking the right one can be daunting. To help you get started, try one of the following.
