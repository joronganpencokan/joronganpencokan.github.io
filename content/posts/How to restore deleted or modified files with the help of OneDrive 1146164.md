# Discover This Expert Technique For Recovering Deleted Items On Onedrive & Say Goodbye To Data Loss Forever!

In today's digital world, data loss has become a major issue for both individuals and organizations. Losing important data, such as documents, photos, and videos, can be catastrophic and can cost you valuable time and money. That’s why it's essential to have a reliable backup and recovery strategy in place, especially if you use cloud services like Microsoft Onedrive.

Luckily, there's a great method for recovering deleted items on Onedrive that you can use to get back any accidentally deleted files. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the technique and how you can use it to avoid data loss forever!

## The Onedrive Recycle Bin

Before we dive into the expert technique, it's important to understand that Onedrive has a built-in recycle bin. The recycle bin works much like the one on your desktop computer. When you delete a file from Onedrive, it is moved to the recycle bin instead of being permanently deleted. This provides a safety net in case you accidentally delete something that you need to recover.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Recovering Deleted Items on Onedrive

To recover deleted items on Onedrive, follow these simple steps:

1. Log in to your Onedrive account, either through the website or the desktop app.
2. Navigate to the "Recycle bin" section of your Onedrive. 
3. Find the file or folder you want to recover in the recycle bin section. 
4. Select the file or folder you want to recover, right-click on it, and click "Restore" from the dropdown menu. 
5. The file or folder will now be restored to its original location on your Onedrive.

That's it! It's that simple to recover deleted items on Onedrive. It's important to note that items in the recycle bin are automatically deleted after 93 days, so it's critical to recover them before then.

## Bonus Tip: Prevent Data Loss with Onedrive File Versioning

Another great feature of Onedrive is file versioning. Onedrive automatically saves multiple versions of your files, so you can easily recover older versions if a newer one becomes corrupted or lost. To access this feature, right-click on the file you want to see the versions for, and click on "Version history." This will show you all the versions of the file that Onedrive has saved.

## Final Thoughts

Data loss is a serious problem that can affect anyone, but with the right techniques and strategies in place, you can avoid it altogether. By using the Onedrive recycle bin and file versioning, you can recover deleted items and prevent data loss in the first place.

Now that you know how to recover deleted items on Onedrive, you can rest easy knowing that your data is safe and secure. So go ahead, delete that file you didn't mean to delete, and recover it with ease – you've got this!


First, you naturally have to make sure you're using OneDrive to back up and sync your files. Both Windows 10 and 11 enable OneDrive by default, whether you want to use it or not. But if you do want it, it's ready and waiting for you. Just make sure you sign in to set up your account and are syncing the necessary folders and files.

 
## Restore a file from the OneDrive Recycle Bin


Okay, now let's say you've deleted a file and need it back. To find the deleted file, you've likely already searched your entire PC and have checked the Windows Recycle Bin but have come up empty. A dedicated recovery tool is always worth trying as they can locate files that no longer reside in the Windows Recycle Bin. But since you're syncing your files with OneDrive, let's give that a shot first.
Alternatively, you can search for the file if you know the specific or approximate name. The search feature peeks into all your OneDrive folders, not just the Recycle Bin. Still, a search may be able to help you zero in on the right file. Type as much of the name as you can in the Search field at the top. You can use wildcards here as well. OneDrive then suggests potential matches. Select the file if you see it among the results or click the option for Show more results to see more possible matches.
Okay, let's look at the next conundrum. You've modified a file that's been synced to OneDrive and you don't like the changes you made, or perhaps a file has been corrupted by a technical glitch or infected with malware. Whatever the reason, you want to restore a previous version of it. For this feat, OneDrive offers two separate options.
With Version History, you can restore previous versions of a single file going back several months. With the Restore your OneDrive feature, you can restore previous versions of all OneDrive files moving forward from a specific date.
There are a few conditions to Restore your OneDrive. First, you need to have a Microsoft 365 account; a regular OneDrive account won't do the trick. Second, the feature can only restore files up to 30 days in the past. Third, the feature will restore the entire OneDrive backup starting from a certain day, which may not be what you want.
If you need to just restore a single file, use the Version History option. If you need to restore an entire group of files starting from a specific day and you have a Microsoft 365 account, try the Restore your OneDrive option.

 
## Restore a file through Version History


At your OneDrive online page, select the file for which you want to view and restore a previous version. Right-click on the file and select Version History or select Version History at the top.
The Version History page previews the current version of the file and then displays a list of dates for each previous version. Click a specific date to view that version of the file. If it's the version you need, click Restore and then Restore again to restore it to its original location. Click Download to open the file in a separate window. You can then save it to a different location (Figure 7).

 
## Restore your OneDrive


To restore an entire OneDrive backup starting from a specific day, go to your main OneDrive page. Click the Settings icon at the top and select Options. At the next screen, click the option for Restore your OneDrive. You may be asked to verify your identity through your Microsoft authentication method. At the next screen, click the dropdown menu for Select a date and choose a timeframe for the version of the file you wish to recover -- Yesterday, One week ago, Three weeks ago, or a Custom date and time.
To further narrow down the date, move the slider left or right to a specific date, anywhere from 1 day ago to 29 days ago. Click a file from the date at which you want to restore the entire backup. For example, clicking a file from five days ago will restore all OneDrive backups from that time through today. Confirm the potential action and then click Restore at the top. Your OneDrive backups are restored starting from the day you selected.
