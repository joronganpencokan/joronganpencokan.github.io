# Hitman 3's Heart-Stopping New Father Challenge - Can You Count Down From 47 for the Secret Ending?

Hitman 3, the latest entry in the popular stealth-action series, has introduced a new challenge that is giving players a heart-stopping experience. The challenge is called "Father," and it requires players to count down from 47 to 1 while taking out targets in a specific order. If the player succeeds, they unlock a secret ending that adds a new depth to the game's story.

To complete the Father challenge, players must follow a set of rules. Firstly, they have to start the mission with only a pistol and a silenced sniper rifle. They are not allowed to use any other weapons, equipment, or explosives. Secondly, they have to eliminate five targets in a set order that represents a countdown from 47 to 1. The targets are scattered across the level, and players have to carefully plan their routes and timings to take them out without being detected.

The countdown begins with the number 47, which is the name of the game's protagonist. After eliminating the first target, players have to move on to the second, which represents the number 46, and so on until they reach the final target that represents the number 1. Each target is identified by a unique code name that hints at their role in the story. For example, the first target is called "The Enforcer," while the last one is called "The Director."

What makes the Father challenge so intense is the fact that players have to count down while simultaneously performing complex tasks, such as sneaking past guards, hacking computers, and disguising themselves as different characters. One mistake can put the whole challenge in jeopardy, as the targets will become aware of the player's presence and trigger alarms or call for reinforcements.

But the reward for completing the Father challenge is worth the risk. The secret ending that unlocks after counting down from 47 to 1 reveals a new layer to the game's narrative that sheds light on the motivations and backstory of the main character. It also sets up a potential sequel or DLC, which will undoubtedly excite fans of the series.

Overall, Hitman 3's Father challenge is a thrilling addition to the game that tests players' skills, patience, and nerve. It is a masterclass in game design that showcases the creativity and innovation of the developers at IO Interactive. Whether you are a seasoned veteran of the series or a newcomer, this challenge is a must-play for anyone who loves challenging and rewarding gameplay. So, can you count down from 47 and unlock the secret ending? The only way to find out is to try it yourself.
