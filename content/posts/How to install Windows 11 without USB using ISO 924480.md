Revolutionary Hack: Install Windows 11 Without USB! The Ultimate No-Fuss Guide Using Just an ISO!

Are you sick and tired of having to mess around with USBs when installing Windows 11? Well, you’re in luck, because there’s a revolutionary hack that lets you install Windows 11 without USB! All you need is an ISO file and this ultimate no-fuss guide.

Firstly, you’ll need to download the Windows 11 ISO file from Microsoft’s website. Once you have the ISO file, right-click on it and select “Mount”. This will create a virtual drive that contains the contents of the ISO file. Make sure to note down the drive letter of the virtual drive.

Next, open Command Prompt as an administrator by clicking on the Start menu and typing “cmd” into the search bar. Right-click on “Command Prompt” and select “Run as Administrator”. In the Command Prompt window, type “diskpart” and press Enter. This will open the DiskPart utility.

Type “list disk” and press Enter. This will show you a list of all the disks on your computer. Note down the number of the disk that you want to install Windows on.

Type “select disk X”, where “X” is the number of the disk that you want to install Windows on. Press Enter.

Type “clean” and press Enter. This will erase all the data on the selected disk.

Type “create partition primary” and press Enter. This will create a primary partition on the disk.

Type “select partition 1” and press Enter. This will select the partition that you just created.

Type “format fs=ntfs quick” and press Enter. This will format the partition in the NTFS file system.

Type “assign letter=X” and press Enter, where “X” is a drive letter that is not already in use on your computer. This will assign the drive letter to the partition.

Type “exit” and press Enter to exit DiskPart.

Next, navigate to the virtual drive in File Explorer where you mounted the Windows 11 ISO file earlier. Copy all the contents of the ISO file to the drive letter that you just assigned to the partition.

Once the copy process is complete, navigate to the root of the partition drive and locate the “setup.exe” file. Double-click on this file to begin the Windows 11 installation process. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

And there you have it – the ultimate no-fuss guide to installing Windows 11 without USB using just an ISO file. This revolutionary hack will save you time and effort, and make your life a whole lot easier!
