# Unlock the Hidden Ability to Upgrade Your Memory Slots in Elden Ring with These Surprising Stone Hacks!

Elden Ring, the upcoming action role-playing game from developer FromSoftware, is one of the most anticipated games of 2022. Set in a high-fantasy world, the game promises to deliver a thrilling gameplay experience with an extensive open world, challenging bosses, and deep lore. One essential part of any action-roleplaying game is your character's ability to upgrade their memory slots, and in Elden Ring, that rule remains the same. In this article, we'll introduce you to some surprising stone hacks that will help you unlock the hidden ability to upgrade your memory slots in Elden Ring.

But first, let us understand what memory slots are and why they are crucial in Elden Ring. Memory slots are the game's mechanics that allow players to equip spells and abilities to their characters. The more memory slots your character has, the more spells and abilities, they can equip. This crucial feature can make or break your gameplay experience, and upgrading your character's memory slots is essential for progress in the game. Here are some of the surprising stone hacks that will help you unlock the full potential of your memory slots.

## Black Stone

Black Stone is a rare drop item in Elden Ring, but it's one of the most effective stones for unlocking memory slots. When used, the Black Stone grants a memory slot in exchange for a small amount of health. The catch with using the Black Stone is that you can only use it once per playthrough, so you must use it wisely. The Black Stone is a powerful tool that can be a game-changer in battles.

## Silverstone

Silverstone is another rare item in Elden Ring, but it's effective for upgrading memory slots. When used, the Silverstone grants two memory slots in exchange for a small amount of Stamina. It's an excellent tool to use if you need more spells and abilities in a short period. Silverstone is a precious resource, and it's advisable to use it in boss battles or situations where you need more memory slots quickly.

## Crystal Stone

The Crystal Stone has a different effect from the Black and Silverstone. When used in Elden Ring, the Crystal Stone increases your character's maximum memory slots. This stone is useful for players who want to upgrade their character's memory slots permanently. The Crystal Stone increases your character's maximum memory slots by one for every ten levels gained, and it ensures that you have a substantial memory slot capacity in the long run.

## Red Stone

Red Stone is an interesting item in Elden Ring as it has a unique effect on your character's memory slots. When used, Red Stone converts uses one of your character's memory slots to regenerate health. It's not as valuable as the previous stones but can be useful if you're in desperate need of health regeneration.

In conclusion, these surprising stone hacks are a game-changer for upgrading your memory slots in Elden Ring. The Black Stone, Silverstone, Crystal Stone, and Red Stone are valuable resources that should be used strategically depending on your playstyle. By using these stones, you can unlock the full potential of your character's memory slots and enhance your gameplay experience.
