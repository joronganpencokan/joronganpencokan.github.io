Renaming your Android phone is a quick and easy process that will add a personal touch to your Bluetooth devices. In this article, we will guide you through the steps to rename your Android device in just three simple steps.

The first step towards renaming your Android phone is to open the "Settings" app on your device. You can find this app by clicking on your app drawer or swiping down from the top of your screen and clicking on the gear icon.

In the "Device name" tab, you’ll see your current device name. Click on the text box to edit the name of your Android phone. You can choose any name you like, as long as it is under 64 characters. Once you have chosen a new device name, click "OK" to save the changes.

Congratulations! You have successfully renamed your Android phone. You can now connect to your Bluetooth devices with a new unique name. This simple and quick process not only enhances the aesthetics of your Android device, but It also adds a personal touch to your Bluetooth devices.

1. Easy Identification: Renaming your Android phone makes it easier to identify your phone when paired with Bluetooth devices

2. Personalization: Adding a unique name tailored to your personality or taste lets you personalize your device.

Out of the box, those devices are named -- you guessed it -- Pixel 6 Pro. So, if both of our phones are around when I go to connect an accessory, I'm not certain which device I'm connecting to.
There's a very easy way to solve that problem, one I always take care of when I first set up an Android device. That solution is to rename your Android device for the purpose of Bluetooth connections. 
For those who might be concerned that renaming a device can cause problems… fret not. Google has made it simple to do this, and the only effect on the device is that it will  broadcast a unique name to any accessory or other device that wants to connect.

## How to rename your Android phone for Bluetooth connections
 
## Requirements


The only thing you'll need to make this work is an updated Android device that runs any version of the operating system newer than Android 9 (which should be just about every Android device on the planet at this point).
Now, when you go to connect an accessory, desktop computer, or any other device to your Android phone, the new name will be displayed. That way, you can always be certain you're connecting to the exact device you need.
One thing you must remember, however, is the new name applies only to Bluetooth connections. If you want to give the device a different global name, applying to more apps and settings than just Bluetooth, that is done via Settings > About Phone > Device Name. There's no reason why you can't change the name in both settings, but if you only want the name to apply to Bluetooth connections, then only make the change in Connected Devices.
