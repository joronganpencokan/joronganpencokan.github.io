# Unlock the Secret to Effortlessly Emailing Your Whole Squad with This Genius MacOS Mail Hack!

Are you tired of separately emailing your whole squad every time you have an important update or event to share? Well, fear no more, because we've got the perfect solution for you! With this genius macOS mail hack, you can easily email your whole squad with just a few clicks!

First things first, you'll need to open up the Mail app on your MacBook. Once you've done that, select 'Compose' to start a new email. Then, enter the email addresses of everyone in your squad in the 'To' field. Instead of typing each email address out separately, you can save time by selecting all the addresses at once. To do this, simply type in the first few letters of the first email address, and then press the 'Tab' key. This should automatically fill in the rest of the email address. Do the same for the remaining email addresses until all are entered into the 'To' field.

Next, you'll want to save this group of email addresses so that you won't have to manually enter them each time you want to email your squad. To do this, click on the 'Add Contact' button, which is located at the bottom of the 'To' field. A new window will pop up where you can enter a name for this group of contacts. For instance, you could call it 'Squad'.

Once you've entered a name for the group, click on the 'Save' button. This will save the group to your contacts, which means you won't have to enter all the email addresses manually anymore! Now, every time you want to email your squad, simply type in the name of the group in the 'To' field, and all the email addresses will automatically populate.

But that's not all! You can also create additional groups to send specific emails to only a select few members of your squad. For instance, you could create a 'Leadership' group for sending important updates to only the leaders in your squad.

To create a new group, simply repeat the above steps by selecting all the email addresses you want in the group and clicking on the 'Add Contact' button. This time, enter a new name for the group and click 'Save'. Now, when you start a new email, you can select this group from your contacts and only those members will receive the email.

In conclusion, emailing your whole squad has never been easier with this handy macOS mail hack. By saving groups of contacts, you can streamline your emailing process and save time. Give it a try and see how much more efficient your squad communication can be!

This article explains how to create a group for list mailing in macOS Mail on Macs running macOS Sierra (10.12) or later.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- To make an email group, go to Contacts > File > New Group, type a name, and press Enter.To add members, go to Contacts > All Contacts, then drag and drop names into the group.

 
##   How to Make an Email Group in macOS  
 

If you frequently email the same group of people when you send messages, assemble the relevant addresses into a group in the macOS Contacts application. That way, you can address messages to the group instead of the individuals in it. macOS Mail will send your email to each person in the group.

 

You could enter all their addresses one by one in the To, Cc, or Bcc field. However, making a group email saves time and ensures you include the same people each time you send a group email.

 

Before you can send a group email, you must create a group in the Contacts application and then select people to include. Here's how.

 
- Open the Contacts app on your Mac by clicking its icon in the Dock at the bottom of the screen.
 - Select File > New Group from the Contacts menu bar.
 - Type a name for the new mailing list in the field that appears for an untitled group.
 - Press Enter on the keyboard to save the new group, which currently has a new name but no members.

 
##   How to Add Members to Your macOS Mail Group  
 

Next, you add members to the group from your existing Contact entries or add new contacts as needed.

 

Open the Contacts app on your Mac by clicking its icon in the Dock at the bottom of the screen.

 

Select File > New Group from the Contacts menu bar.

 

Type a name for the new mailing list in the field that appears for an untitled group.

 

Press Enter on the keyboard to save the new group, which currently has a new name but no members.

 
- Open the Contacts app on your Mac.
 - Make sure the group list is visible in the Contacts app. If it isn't, go to View > Show Groups from the Contacts menu bar.
 - Click All Contacts at the top of the Group column on the left side of the screen to display every contact you have entered into the app in alphabetical order.
 - Drag and drop individual contact names in the list of names in the center column onto the new group you formed in the Group column. If more than one email address is listed for a given contact, macOS Mail uses the recently used address when sending a message to the list.
 - If no email is listed on the contact, that person won't receive an email. However, you can click the contact's name and select Edit at the bottom of the contact's card to add an email address.
 - If you need to add a new contact to the group, choose the plus sign (+) under the large contact card, select New Contact in the drop-down menu, and enter the contact's details. The new contact shows up under All Contacts automatically, where you can drag and drop it onto the group you just formed.

 

When you finish dragging contacts onto the new group, click its name in the group list to see the people you added.

 

Open the Contacts app on your Mac.

 

Make sure the group list is visible in the Contacts app. If it isn't, go to View > Show Groups from the Contacts menu bar.

 

Click All Contacts at the top of the Group column on the left side of the screen to display every contact you have entered into the app in alphabetical order.

 

Drag and drop individual contact names in the list of names in the center column onto the new group you formed in the Group column. If more than one email address is listed for a given contact, macOS Mail uses the recently used address when sending a message to the list.

 
If no email is listed on the contact, that person won't receive an email. However, you can click the contact's name and select Edit at the bottom of the contact's card to add an email address.
 

If you need to add a new contact to the group, choose the plus sign (+) under the large contact card, select New Contact in the drop-down menu, and enter the contact's details. The new contact shows up under All Contacts automatically, where you can drag and drop it onto the group you just formed.

 

To send an email to the group, open a new message in Mail and type the new group name in the To field. That action populates the field with the email addresses of the group members automatically.

 
If you decide to remove someone from a group, click the name to highlight it and press the Delete key on the keyboard. The name is removed from the group but not from the All Contacts list in the Contacts app.
