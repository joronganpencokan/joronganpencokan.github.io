Introduction

In the current state of remote work, Zoom has become an essential tool for virtual meetings, interviews, and high-level events. But with great power comes great responsibility, and as many of us have learned the hard way, there is nothing worse than forgetting to mute yourself and being caught off guard by background noise. Fortunately, this can be quickly resolved with the help of three secrets to mastering Zoom muting skills. In this article, we will discuss the top tips that can help you avoid an uncomfortable situation and genuinely take charge of your sound.

Secret #1: Always Check Your Audio Before a Meeting

One of the most important things to do in mastering Zoom muting skills is to check your audio settings every time you have a meeting. The first step is to make sure that your computer’s audio input and output device is selected correctly. The second step is to test your microphone to make sure that it’s working properly. Lastly, ensure that your audio levels are optimized to produce the best quality sound for your virtual meetings.

Secret #2: Know When to Mute Yourself

Knowing when to mute yourself is essential to mastering Zoom muting skills. Generally, this should be done when you’re not speaking or when there’s background noise that could compromise the audio quality of the meeting. You could use shortcuts to mute and unmute yourself quickly during a meeting (Ctrl + M for Windows, Command + Shift + A for Mac). If you’re hosting the meeting, you can use the “Mute All” feature when the discussion starts to get out of hand, and you need everyone to listen attentively.

Secret #3: Beware of Keyboard Noises and Background Sound

While online meetings can be convenient, it's essential to always remain mindful of the audio quality that you're providing. One of the most common culprits of background noise is keyboard sounds. When somebody types on their keyboard while they're talking, that sound can be downright distracting. It’s advisable to always mute yourself when typing to avoid including the sound in the audio mix.

Additionally, beware of other background sounds, such as pets or children in the room, cooking, or loud traffic outside your window. It's easy to become distracted by all these noises, so taking the necessary precautions before starting the meeting goes a long way in facilitating a more productive conversation.

Conclusion

With Zoom becoming the new normal, mastering Zoom muting skills is not an easy task, but it's essential to remain professional at all times. Following these three secrets will help you avoid embarrassing moments and ensure seamless communication in your virtual meetings. Remember always to check your audio, know when to mute yourself, and beware of keyboard and background noises. With these tips, you’re sure never to get caught off guard by a Zoom mishap again!

If you're the host and need to keep people quiet during a meeting, you can do that through the Participants section of the app. Follow these steps for Windows, Mac, or mobile devices:

 
To unmute when you need to speak, tap the screen to open the command again and then tap Unmute.
 
- Hover your mouse over the Zoom screen.
 - Click Participants in the menu that appears across the bottom of the screen.
 - In the right-hand navigation menu that opens, you have two options:
 - Click Mute All at the bottom of the menu to mute everyone on the call.Hover over a guest's name, then click Mute next to their name to silence them. They will see a message on their screen indicating you have muted them.

Unmuting may vary slightly depending on how the meeting is set up. If you're experiencing issues when trying to unmute a participant, read the support document from Zoom on the topic.
 

When you do, the participant will see a message on their screen indicating that you have asked them unmute or telling them that they are now unmuted. The message will vary depending upon the type of device in use.

 

If you have unmuted someone yet they still can't be heard, they will need to respond to the message on their screen to unmute themselves. This happens when a mobile device is being used by the participant.
