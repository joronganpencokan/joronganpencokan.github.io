Are you tired of constantly swiping through endless pages of apps on your iPhone, trying to find the one you need? Do you struggle to keep your home screen organized and clutter-free? If you answered yes to either of these questions, then you need to unlock the ultimate iPhone hack to help you master your home screen and manage your apps like a pro!

Step 1: Clean Up Your Home Screen

The first step in mastering your home screen is to clean it up. Only keep the apps that you use regularly on your home screen. Move the rest of your apps to the second or third page, where you can easily access them when needed.

To move apps around on your home screen, simply press and hold on an app until it begins to wiggle. Then, drag the app to its new location and release it. You can also create folders to help keep your apps organized. To create a folder, press and hold on an app until it begins to wiggle. Then, drag the app on top of another app that you want to include in the same folder. Name the folder something descriptive, such as "Social Media" or "Productivity."

Step 2: Use the App Library

The App Library is a new feature in iOS 14 that automatically organizes your apps into categories, such as Social, Entertainment, and Productivity. You can access the App Library by swiping to the right on your home screen until you reach the last page.

To find an app in the App Library, simply tap on the category that it belongs to. You can also search for an app by typing its name in the search bar at the top of the App Library.

Step 3: Customize Your App Icons

If you want to take your home screen customization to the next level, you can customize your app icons. There are a variety of apps and websites that allow you to create custom app icons with different colors, styles, and designs.

To customize an app icon, you will need to download the app or website's custom icon image and save it to your Photos app. Then, press and hold on the app that you want to customize until it begins to wiggle. Tap on the "Edit Home Screen" option, and then tap on the app's icon. Choose the custom icon that you saved in your Photos app, and then tap "Done" to save your changes.

In conclusion, by following these three steps, you can unlock the ultimate iPhone hack to help you master your home screen and manage your apps like a pro. Clean up your home screen, use the App Library to organize your apps, and customize your app icons to make your phone look and feel exactly how you want it to. With these tips, you can take control of your iPhone and streamline your daily routine.

Managing apps on the iPhone Home screen is an effective way to customize your iPhone. It's especially helpful because it allows you to organize apps in a way that makes sense to you. Whether you prefer to categorize your apps by function, productivity, or color, you can do it.

 

The iPhone multitouch screen makes it easy to move or delete apps, create and delete folders, and create new Home screen pages.

 
##   How to Rearrange Apps on iPhone Home Screen Pages  
 

It makes sense to change the locationÂ of apps on your iPhone. You probably want the apps you frequently use on the Home screen. In contrast, an app you only use occasionally might be hidden away in a folder on another page.

 
Information in this article applies to iPhones with iOS 6 through iOS 12.
 

To move apps, follow these steps:

 
- Tap and hold the app you want to move. When the apps wiggle, indicating they are in editing mode, the app is ready to move.
 - If you have an iPhone with a 3D Touch screen, don't press the screen firmly because that triggers the 3D Touch menus. Use a light tap and hold instead.
 - Drag the app to the new location you want it to occupy.
 - When the app is where you want it, lift your finger off the screen.
 - Tap the Home button to stop the apps from wiggling and save the new arrangement. On iPhones without a Home button, tap Done at the top of the screen to stop the wiggling and exit the editing mode.

If you're running iOS 14 and up, you've got another way to keep your home screen neat: The iPhone App Library. This feature lets you keep your most-used apps on your home screen and move everything else to a section you only go to sometimes. Learn all about it in How to Use the iPhone App Library.
 
- Tap and hold an app until all the apps wiggle. Any app with an X in the corner can be deleted.

 - Tap Delete in the confirmation pop-up. For apps that store data in iCloud, you are asked whether you want to delete the data as well.
 - Make your choice, and the app is deleted. Tap Done (or the Home button) to stop the apps from wiggling.

 
##   How to Create and Delete Folders on iPhone  
 

Storing apps in folders is a great way to manage apps. It makes sense to put similar apps in the same place. To create a folder on your iPhone:

 

Tap and hold an app until all the apps wiggle. Any app with an X in the corner can be deleted.

 

Tap the X on the apps you want to delete.

 

Tap Delete in the confirmation pop-up. For apps that store data in iCloud, you are asked whether you want to delete the data as well.

There's one scenario in which your apps might seem to be deleted but are still on your iPhone. Learn how to get missing apps back on your iPhone.
 
- Tap and hold one of the apps you want to put into a folder.
 - Drop the app you are holding onto a second app intended for the folder (every folder needs at least two apps). The first app appears to merge with the second app.
 - When you take your finger off the screen, a folder is created.
 - The text bar above the new folder contains a name assigned by the iPhone. To change the name, tap the name field and type a new name.
 - Drag any other apps you want to include into the folder.
 - When you're done, tap the Home button (or Done) to save the changes.

 
###   Delete Folders  
 

Deleting folders is easy. Drag all the apps out of a folder to the Home screen to delete the folder.

 

Tap and hold one of the apps you want to put into a folder.

 

Drop the app you are holding onto a second app intended for the folder (every folder needs at least two apps). The first app appears to merge with the second app.

 

When you take your finger off the screen, a folder is created.

 

The text bar above the new folder contains a name assigned by the iPhone. To change the name, tap the name field and type a new name.

 

Drag any other apps you want to include into the folder.

 

When you're done, tap the Home button (or Done) to save the changes.

 
##   How to Create Home Screen Pages on iPhone  
 

You can also organize your apps by putting them on different Home screen pages. Pages are the multiple screens of apps that are created when you have too many apps to fit on one screen.

 

To create a new page:

 
- Tap and hold the app or folder you want to move to a new page.
 - While the apps wiggle, drag the app or folder to the right edge of the iPhone screen.
 - Hold the app there until it moves to a new page.
 - When you're on the page where you want to leave the app or folder, remove your finger from the screen.
 - Click the Home button (or Done) to save the change.

 
###   Delete Pages on iPhone  
 

Deleting pages is similar to deleting folders. To drag an app or folder off the page, drag it to the left edge of the screen to a previous page or to the right edge if there are additional pages after the one you are deleting. When the page is empty, and you click the Home or Done button, the page is deleted.

 

Tap and hold the app or folder you want to move to a new page.

 

While the apps wiggle, drag the app or folder to the right edge of the iPhone screen.

 

Hold the app there until it moves to a new page.

 

When you're on the page where you want to leave the app or folder, remove your finger from the screen.

 

Click the Home button (or Done) to save the change.

 
There's a limit to how many folders and apps you can have on your iPhone. The exact number depends on the iPhone model.
 
##   About the Dock  
 

The dock is the bottom bar on the iPhone. It shows on every Home screen and has room for four apps or folders. It is visible on all the Home screen pages on your iPhone, so it makes sense to park your favorite apps here. They wiggle and move in the same way any of the apps on the screen do. If you have four apps in the dock, move one before you add another.
