Shocking News: Google Pulls the Plug on Onhub Routers! What You Need to Know Before It's Too Late!

If you are one of the millions of people who use Google's OnHub routers, we have some bad news for you - Google is discontinuing its OnHub routers. Google announced the news on its support page and has started recommending Google Wi-Fi devices as an alternative. As a result, it's time to bid farewell to some of the excellent features of the OnHub.

So, what does this mean for you? Here's everything you need to know about this decision by Google and what you should do next.

What are OnHub Routers and Why are They Being Discontinued?

OnHub routers are like traditional routers that connect your devices to the internet, but they are equipped with advanced features such as easy setup, automatic firmware updates, and an intuitive mobile app for managing your network. They were launched in August 2015 as a collaborative effort between Google and TP-Link, ASUS, and other hardware partners.

The OnHub routers are being discontinued because Google has decided to focus on the more streamlined Google Wi-Fi devices. According to a statement by Google, the company is "deeply committed to providing easy-to-use and secure wireless connectivity in the home."

What Happens to Your OnHub Router?

If you already own an OnHub router, it will continue to work, and you will still receive support until October 2022. You can continue using the router without any significant issues. However, after that, Google will no longer provide any software or security updates, and it's advisable to replace it.

What Should You Do Next?

If you're happy with your OnHub router, you don’t have to rush out and buy a new router right away. Hopefully, by 2022, Google will have an exciting new replacement for the OnHub router that will be even better. However, if you're looking to upgrade your network, you might want to consider switching to Google Wi-Fi.

Google Wi-Fi devices are easy to use, provide excellent coverage, and have some features that the OnHub router doesn't offer. Additionally, they work well with other smart home devices and offer exceptional security features.

What are the Alternative Options?

If you are looking for alternative routers, other companies offer a wide variety of options with unique features that cater to different needs. These options include Netgear, ASUS, Linksys, and D-Link. 

Netgear provides great performance, easy setup, a circle parental controls feature, and excellent multigigabit ethernet ports. ASUS offers a wide range of routers with excellent specs and gaming features. Linksys provides robust routers that cater to a variety of needs, such as their WRT routers for open-source firmware compatibility. D-Link is an affordable option that offers excellent core features and reliable connectivity for regular home use.

Conclusion

In conclusion, if you are a current OnHub router user, there is no need to panic or rush to buy a new router. Google has provided ample time to switch over to the more streamlined and secure Google Wi-Fi devices, and similarly, there are tons of alternative routers available.

With excellent features and unique capabilities, the takedown of OnHub routers is a mere bump in the road to a more secure, reliable, and easy-to-use internet connection. Do your research and choose the best router that caters to your needs when making your next purchase.

The Google graveyard is growing by one more in 2022, as the company has announced its ending software support for OnHub routers.

 

Google initially launched its OnHub routers in 2015. It quickly followed that release with the launch of a simpler mesh networking router called Google Wifi, which Google later upgraded to the Nest Wifi system. Now, the company has announced that software support for OnHub routers will end in 2022.

 

Google recently updated the support document for its OnHub routers, noting that official software support will end on December 19, 2022. The document says the routers will continue to work after the end date, however, they won’t receive any additional software features or security updates. Google also alerted OnHub customers via email, according to Android Police.

 

On top of ending software support, OnHub routers will no longer be manageable via the Google Home app. Google also notes that you won’t be able to use Google Assistant commands anymore, either, and the ability to run speed tests or update your network settings will become unavailable. 

 

New security vulnerabilities continue to pop up, so Google recommends upgrading to a new wireless router as soon as possible. To help soften the death of OnHub, Google is also offering a 40 percent off coupon for its Nest Wifi routers. Google says the coupon will be delivered by email to current OnHub customers and will only be available until March 31, 2022.
