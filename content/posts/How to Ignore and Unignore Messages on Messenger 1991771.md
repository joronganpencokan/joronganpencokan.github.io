1. Why ignoring messages is not a good idea

Ignoring messages may seem like the easy way out, especially if you're busy or not in the mood to respond. However, it can create a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity, leaving the other person wondering whether you received or read the message, whether you're upset with them, or whether you're simply ignoring them. This can cause miscommunication or even hurt feelings, especially if the message is time-sensitive or important.

Fortunately, Messenger has a feature that allows you to unignore a conversation thread and receive notifications for new messages. Here's how to do it:

- Open Messenger and go to the chat you want to unignore
- Tap and hold on the chat until a menu pops up
- Select "Unignore Messages"

You'll now receive notifications for messages in that chat, and they will appear in your Messenger inbox like any other message thread.

3. Regaining control on Messenger

Unignoring messages is not only about being responsive but also about regaining control of your contacts and conversations on Messenger. Once you unignore a chat, you can prioritize it by marking it as a favorite or muting it if it's a group chat that's too noisy or distracting.

You can also customize your notification settings for each chat, choosing which ones to receive notifications for, and which ones to silence.

Additionally, you can manage your Messenger settings from your Facebook account, such as blocking or reporting messages, limiting message requests, or controlling who can contact you on Messenger.

Conclusion:

Unignoring messages is not only about being polite, but it's also about being efficient, productive, and intentional in your online communication. By using Messenger's features to your advantage, you can stay on top of your messages, prioritize your contacts, and avoid miscommunication or missed opportunities.
