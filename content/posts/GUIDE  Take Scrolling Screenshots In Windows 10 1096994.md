# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Take Scrolling Screenshots in Windows 10 - Step-by-Step Guide Inside!

Taking screenshots in Windows 10 is a common task that almost everyone does frequently. However, what if you want to capture an entire webpage, a long document, or a chat log that requires scrolling down? In such cases, taking a regular screenshot won't work. You'll either end up with a partial screenshot or have to take multiple screenshots and stitch them together manually.

Thankfully, Windows 10 has a built-in feature that lets you capture scrolling screenshots effortlessly. It's called 'Screenshot (or Screen snip) and Sketch.' It's an updated version of the old Snipping Tool, which provides more flexibility and features to capture screenshots in various ways.

In this article, we'll walk you through the step-by-step process of taking scrolling screenshots in Windows 10.

## Step 1: Open the 'Screenshot and Sketch' App

You can search for the app in the Start menu, or you can use the shortcut keys 'Windows key + Shift + S.' A small toolbar will appear at the top of the screen.

## Step 2: Select the Type of Screenshot You Want to Take

You'll have four options for taking screenshots: rectangular snip, freeform snip, window snip, and full-screen snip. Select the last option for taking a scrolling screenshot.

## Step 3: Capture the Scrolling Screenshot

Click on the 'Full-screen snip' option; it will dim the screen and display a toolbar at the top right corner of the screen. You'll have various options to capture the screenshot, such as delaying the capture or taking a single screenshot.

Click on the 'Capture' button and immediately start to scroll down the area you want to capture. You can scroll smoothly or slowly; the app will capture the entire screen automatically.

## Step 4: Edit and Save the Scrolling Screenshot

After capturing the screenshot, you'll see that it opens in the 'Sketch and Snip' app. Here you can annotate, highlight, or crop the screenshot as you'd wish.

After editing it, you can save the screenshot wherever you want on your computer.

Taking scrolling screenshots in Windows 10 is that easy!

## Final Thoughts

With the 'Screenshot and Sketch' app, taking scrolling screenshots in Windows 10 is incredibly easy, and you don't need to use any third-party software or tools.

When you need to capture a long webpage, document or chat log, don't hesitate to use the built-in feature. It's a convenient way to have a clear and precise record of exactly what you need, without compromising quality or accuracy.
