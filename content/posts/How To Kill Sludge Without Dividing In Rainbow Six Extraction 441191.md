Title: "Eliminate Sludge in Rainbow Six Extraction with a Simple Trick that Keeps Your Team United!"

Rainbow Six Extraction is one of the most popular online tactical shooter games today. Players assume the role of elite operators tasked with fighting off an infestation of an alien parasite. Your team must work together to extract samples, gather information, and basically stay alive while fighting off hordes of enemies.

One of the biggest obstacles in the game is the deadly sludge that can quickly cripple your team's progress. This sticky substance slows you down, deals damage, and attracts even more parasites. But before you divide your team and spread out to avoid this menace, there's a simple trick you can use to eliminate sludge and keep your squad united.

The trick is to synchronize your abilities to clear out sludge effectively. While it sounds easy, proper coordination is the key to success. Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Communication is vital! The first thing you should do when you encounter sludge is to alert your team. Using in-game voice communication channels or even just typing in the chatbox, let your teammates know where the sludge is and that you need their help.

Step 2: Get your operators with abilities that can clear out the sludge. Some operators can use their gadgets to get rid of sludge better than others.

Step 3: Time your abilities. Once everyone on your team is aware of the situation and has the appropriate operator, you need to time your sludge elimination abilities. Using your gadgets one by one will prove ineffective since the sludge will regenerate quickly. Instead, synchronize the uses of your sludge elimination abilities to ensure maximum clearance.

For example, one teammate can use their operator ability to remove the first layer of sludge, allowing the others to clear out the remaining layers effectively. If you're quick and accurate, it is possible to clear out large patches of sludge in mere seconds.

Final words

In Rainbow Six Extraction, teamwork is an integral part of the game. The sludge is just another obstacle that can be tackled effectively with proper coordination. So, before you start dividing your team and running around sludge patches, try using this simple trick to eliminate sludge together. It provides a more efficient, united team and ultimately leads you to win the game.

Use this trick to clear out the sludge in Rainbow Six Extraction and your team will be grateful for your timely coordination! Let us know about the results of this trick in the comments section.
