# Revolutionize Your Audio Experience: Learn How to Enhance Sound and Microphone Quality on Windows Today!

Are you tired of distorted sound and poor microphone quality on your Windows computer? Do you want to take your audio experience to the next level without breaking the bank? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then keep reading! In this article, we will discuss some easy and effective ways to enhance sound and microphone quality on Windows.

## Upgrade Your Audio Drivers

The first step to improving sound and microphone quality on Windows is to ensure that your audio drivers are up to date. Device drivers are essential software components that enable your computer to communicate with its hardware, including audio devices. Outdated audio drivers can cause several issues, including sound glitches, static, and reduced microphone sensitivity.

To update your audio drivers, go to your manufacturer's website and search for the latest audio drivers for your device. Alternatively, you can use a driver updater tool to automatically download and install the latest drivers. Once you have updated your drivers, restart your computer and check if there is any improvement in sound and microphone quality.

## Adjust Sound Settings

Windows has several built-in sound settings that can help you enhance audio quality. To access these settings, right-click on the speaker icon on your taskbar and select "Sound." From here, you can adjust the sound level, speaker settings, and microphone properties.

If you're having trouble with sound distortion or noise, try tinkering with the equalizer settings. These settings can help you fine-tune audio output based on different sound frequencies. You can also try turning off audio enhancements, which can sometimes cause audio distortion and static.

To adjust microphone properties, select the "Recording" tab, right-click on your microphone, and select "Properties." From here, you can adjust the microphone sensitivity, noise suppression, and echo cancellation settings. Adjusting these settings can help you reduce background noise and improve microphone quality.

## Use Audio Enhancement Software

Another way to revolutionize your audio experience on Windows is to use audio enhancement software. These programs can help you improve sound quality, boost bass, and add special effects to your audio output. Some popular audio enhancement software for Windows includes Dolby Atmos, DFX Audio Enhancer, and Boom 3D.

Audio enhancement software can also help you reduce noise and echo in your microphone input. Programs like Krisp and NoiseGator use advanced algorithms to remove background noise and enhance speech clarity.

## Upgrade Your Audio Hardware

If you've tried all the software tweaks and still find that your audio quality is lacking, it may be time to upgrade your audio hardware. Consider investing in a high-quality pair of wired or wireless headphones or upgrading your desktop speakers. If you make a lot of conference calls or record podcasts, investing in a high-end microphone can also make a world of difference.

Conclusion

Revolutionizing your audio experience on Windows is a simple and achievable goal. By updating your audio drivers, adjusting sound settings, using audio enhancement software, and upgrading your audio hardware, you can enjoy crisp, clear, and high-quality sound on your Windows device. So why wait? Enhance your audio experience today!

Microphone and audio quality on your PC may still be subpar, even if you use high-end audio input and output devices. Fortunately, Windows 10 and 11 come with many built-in enhancements that can help you get a superior audio experience. We’ve gathered a series of tips to help you improve sound and microphone quality on your Windows PC. 
 
Tip: learn how to customize your Windows startup sound.
 
## 1. Enhance Audio Feature
 
Windows 11 allows you to optimize sound features manually for each audio device connected to your PC. Follow the steps laid out below to enhance audio features for output/input devices:
 
- Go to the Settings app by right-clicking the Start menu.

 
- Go to “System” in the left pane, then click the “Sound” option on the right.

 
- Select “All sound devices” under the “Advanced” section.

 
- Select the audio device you want to enhance under either the “Output devices” or “Input devices” sections.

 
- Scroll down to find the “Enhance audio” option under the “Output/Input settings” section and click it to turn it on.

 
In some cases, turning on the audio enhancement feature can lead to more sound issues on your Windows PC. If that happens, repeat the same steps to turn it off before moving on to the next solution.
 
## 2. Configure Enhancement Settings
 
Windows 11 audio devices, such as Realtek, offer audio enhancement features. Follow the steps below to turn them on.
 
- Open “Settings -> System -> Sound -> Advanced” and select “More sound settings.”

 
- Click on a device, such as “Speakers” that we are selecting here, then choose “Properties.”

 
- Move to the “Enhancements” tab, make sure “Immediate mode” is on and choose the sound effects you prefer from the list, like “Voice Cancellation” or “Pitch Shift,” then hit “Apply” to save the settings.

 
## 3. Increase Microphone Levels
 
Low-quality microphone sound may happen due to two reasons: a microphone array quality issue or low volume of the microphone in use. Rectify this situation by following the steps below.
 
- Make sure you’ve turned on “Enhanced audio” for your “Microphone Array” in the “Input section,” as shown above.

 
- If the above solution didn’t improve the microphone array quality, you may want to try increasing its volume. Search for the “Control Panel” app from the Start menu and open it by clicking it.

 
- Select the “Hardware and Sound” option.

 
- Under “Sound, click on “Manage audio devices.”

 
- At the top of the pop-up window, move to the “Recording” tab, then click the microphone in use and choose “Properties.”

 
- Click on the “Levels” tab  to find the “Microphone” volume bar, change the volume by dragging the arrow to the right, then hit “Apply” to save the changes before closing the window.

 
Tip: Test you mic in the Settings app to determine whether it is working. If the microphone is not working, you may have to reinstall the audio drivers.
 
## 4. Activate Spatial Sound
 
Enabling Spatial Sound will simulate a surround sound setup that also improves the audio device’s sound quality. Follow the steps below to enable it.
 
- Open “Settings -> System -> Sound.”
 - Select the output device you want to change, then click on the arrow next to it.

 
- Scroll down to the “Spatial sound” section, click the down arrow beside “Type,” and select “Windows Sonic for Headphones.”

 
- In Windows 10, you’ll need to tap on the “Device properties” button under “Choose your output device” to view this option.

 
If Windows’s default three-dimensional audio is not satisfying, you can download and enable other spatial sound formats from Microsoft Store. For instance, DTS Sound Unbound can help you experience an immersive sound while gaming with headphones on. If you are a cinephile, you can download Dolby Access audio format to hear more details and realism while watching a movie.
 
## 5. Activate Mono Audio
 
Mono audio makes both right and left audio channels produce a single sound simultaneously. As a result, it can be a useful feature to improve sound quality, especially when using headphones. Enable it as shown in the following steps.
 
- Open “Settings -> System-> Sound.”
 - Find the “Mono audio” option under the “Output” section, then enable it to combine both audio channels.

 
- If you’re running Windows 10, you’ll need to go to “Settings -> Ease of Access -> Audio” to find the option.

 
Good to know: learn how to increase the maximum volume in Windows. 
 
## 6. Update Audio Drivers
 
Keeping Windows up to date may improve audio and microphone quality and fix any related issues. However, you also need to remember to update your audio drivers manually, as new OS updates won’t do that. Follow the instructions below to update them.
 
- Right-click the Start menu and select “Device Manager” from the pop-up window.

 
- Scroll down to find “Sound, video and game controllers,” click on its arrow to expand it, then right-click the concerned audio driver to select “Update driver.”

 
- Choose “Search automatically for drivers.”

 
- Repeat these steps for other audio drivers to ensure that they are all up to date.

 
## 7. Use Realtek Audio Console
 
Windows 11 and 10 come with a built-in Realtek Audio Console app that allows you to remove echoes and other unwanted sounds when using the microphone. We show you how to use it below.
 
- Click on the Start menu, search for “Realtek Audio Console” and open it.

 
- Select “Microphone Array” or any other recording device from the left side of the window and enable the “AEC” feature by clicking the toggle.

 
## 8. Install Third-Party Audio Enhancement Software
 
If none of these methods were helpful in improving audio and microphone quality in Windows, you can download and use third-party apps to improve your PC’s sound quality. Below you’ll find a list of suggestions:
 
- Equalizer APO
 - Letasoft Sound Booster
 - FXSound
 - Boom 3D

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does my audio sound distorted in Windows?
 
First, check your speakers. Make sure your speaker jack is securely inserted into the computer’s speaker/headphone port. If the distortion persists, try switching speakers or headphones to determine whether they are the cause of the distortion. Audio driver issues may also be to blame, so make sure they are up to date.
 
Sometimes the mic actively receiving input will cause a feedback loop and pick up audio from your speakers, while your PC sends the mic’s input back through the speakers. In this case, you’ll need to create more distance between the mic and speakers. Alternatively, try turning down the speakers or decreasing the mic’s sensitivity.
 
If, on the other hand, you’re not receiving sound in Windows, follow this helpful guide.
 
### What can I do if the app I’m using doesn’t recognize the mic?
 
Give the app microphone permission. If you have accidentally selected “Deny” or the app didn’t ask for microphone access, you can enable it in “Settings -> Privacy and Security -> Microphone.” Make sure the app you are using has access to the mic.
