As the name suggests, the Jetpack Potion gives you a Jetpack that you can use to move around the map faster. Without this potion, you will lose quite a bit of time simply getting from one point to another. So, here’s how to make the Jetpack Potion in Roblox Wacky Wizards.
 
## How to Get Jetpack Potion in Wacky Wizards Roblox
 
The ingredients needed for the Jetpack Potion are Hat of Gears and Bird. Collect these items and put them in the Cauldron to brew this potion and drink it. This will make the Jetpack appear and you can move around with it.
 

 
Now, Hat of Gears is a premium item which you can purchase by spending Robux. But you can get it for free if you give the Cyclops Eye to Oz the Wizard after getting the Robux ingredient from him. But you can only do this once a day and you get five uses of this item. Note that the Cyclops Eye can be obtained by beating the hourly boss.
 
The Bird, on the other hand, is a free item and you can obtain it by going to the very top of the big tree you can see from your Cauldron area.
