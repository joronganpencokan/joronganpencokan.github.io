Are You Using A FAKE Keyboard? 5 Simple Ways To Spot A Non-Mechanical Keyboard

When it comes to typing, gamers and typists alike are getting pickier than ever before. The tactile response of the keys and the sound they make can make or break a user’s typing experience. That’s why mechanical keyboards are becoming increasingly popular with gamers and writers alike. However, not all keyboards are created equal. Some may look the part, but are actually non-mechanical keyboards disguised as mechanical keyboards. In this article, we will discuss five simple ways to spot a non-mechanical keyboard.

1. Check The Switch Types

The first step in spotting a non-mechanical keyboard is to identify the switch types. Mechanical keyboards use mechanical switches, while non-mechanical keyboards use rubber dome, scissor, or capacitive switches. To determine the switch type, look for information on the keyboard’s packaging or do some research online. A mechanical keyboard will often list the type of switches it uses in its product description.

2. Look For Backlighting

Backlighting is another feature that can help distinguish mechanical keyboards from non-mechanical keyboards. Mechanical keyboards often feature backlit keys, which enhance the user’s overall typing experience. Non-mechanical keyboards can have backlighting too, but it’s typically less consistent and not as bright.

3. Check The Weight

Another way to tell if you have a mechanical keyboard or not is to check the weight. Mechanical keyboards are generally heavier than non-mechanical keyboards due to the metal plate and switches used to construct it. Non-mechanical keyboards are generally lighter in weight because they don’t use as many parts.

4. Feel The Keys

One of the most significant differences between mechanical and non-mechanical keyboards is the tactile response of the keys. Mechanical keyboards offer a satisfying and audible click when you press down on a key. Non-mechanical keyboards may be quieter, but they lack the same tactile feedback, so the user will not have the same typing experience.

5. Check The Price

Lastly, check the price. Mechanical keyboards are usually more expensive than non-mechanical keyboards because they use higher quality materials and superior technology. If a keyboard is priced similarly to a non-mechanical keyboard, it is likely to be a fake mechanical keyboard.

In conclusion, the differences between mechanical and non-mechanical keyboards may be subtle, but it’s essential to know how to spot a non-mechanical keyboard that’s falsely advertised as a mechanical one. While there’s nothing inherently wrong with non-mechanical keyboards, if you’re looking for a quality typing experience, then a mechanical keyboard is the way to go. By using these five simple ways, you should be able to differentiate between the two and make an informed purchasing decision.

### 
What to Know
 
- A mechanical keyboard uses switches rather than a membrane to register keystrokes.Look for a louder and more 'clicky' keyboard sound to identify if it's a mechanical keyboard.Lift a keycap off the keyboard to see if there is a switch underneath it.

 
##   How Can You Tell if a Keyboard Is Mechanical or Membrane?  
 

There are a few different ways to tell if a keyboard is mechanical or membrane. Some are simpler than others. Here's a look at the best method to check if a keyboard is membrane or mechanical-based.

 
- On your keyboard, tap the key and see how loud it sounds. If it's pretty loud and clicky, it's almost certainly a mechanical keyboard.
 - Alternatively, carefully lift one of the keys from the keyboard and check if there is a switch underneath the key. If there is, it's a mechanical keyboard.
 - If you've recently purchased the keyboard, check the packaging and see if it states anything about being a mechanical keyboard. If it doesn't, it's a 'regular' membrane-based keyboard.

 
##   What Do Mechanical Keyboards Feel Like?  
 

A mechanical keyboard generally feels a lot different from a membrane-based keyboard. Here's a look at what to expect from the feeling of a mechanical keyboard.

If you've recently purchased the keyboard, check the packaging and see if it states anything about being a mechanical keyboard. If it doesn't, it's a 'regular' membrane-based keyboard.

 
- Mechanical keyboards are more tactile. Thanks to how mechanical keyboard switches feel, they feel more responsive and more tactile every time you tap a key. Mechanical keyboards are louder. A mechanical keyboard tends to make a lot more noise than a regular one because of the switches involved. You'll (potentially) make fewer mistakes. Due to how a mechanical keyboard feels, you gain better typing feedback which means you might be more accurate and less prone to errors. More durable. A mechanical keyboard feels heavier than a regular one which means it's more durable and can withstand a few knocks.

 
##   What Is the Difference Between a Regular and Mechanical Keyboard?  
 

A regular keyboard and a mechanical keyboard have several differences. It's helpful to know how they differ before making a purchase. Here's what to expect.

 
- They sound different. A regular keyboard is much quieter than a mechanical one and appropriate for an open office or a more peaceful working environment.They're priced differently. Membrane or regular keyboards tend to be much cheaper than a mechanical ones, although they don't have as long a lifespan. Mechanical keyboards are sturdier. Mechanical keyboards are generally sturdier and more durable, which will last users longer. Mechanical keyboards have removable parts. It's possible to remove a mechanical keyboard's keycaps and customize them. A membrane-based one doesn't offer this option.

 
##   What Is Considered Mechanical Keyboard?  
 

A mechanical keyboard is any keyboard that uses switches instead of a membrane to allow you to perform keystrokes. 

 

A mechanical keyboard is more durable than a regular keyboard, so it feels different to the touch immediately. It's generally heavier and feels more substantial. These keyboards are also more expensive than regular ones, making it easier to identify them before purchasing. 

 
- How do I clean a mechanical keyboard?
 - Disconnect your keyboard, turn it upside down, and gently shake loose debris to clean a mechanical keyboard. Use compressed air and a small handheld vacuum to dislodge debris under the keycaps. Use a keycap puller tool to remove the keycaps and then use the compressed air inside the switch area. Use a cloth with a gentle cleaning solution to wipe inside the switch area gently.
 - How do I build a mechanical keyboard?
 - To build a custom mechanical keyboard, decide on the keyboard size you want and choose the features you want, including RGB lighting, QMK firmware, and USB port. Go to an online store to select and buy the parts you wish (keyboard case, plate, circuit board, stabilizer, switches, and keycaps). You'll also need tools like a soldering iron, a solder sucker, solder wire, and a keycap puller. For more information, visit a DIY website.
 - How do I fix sticky keys on a mechanical keyboard?
 - If you have sticky keys on your mechanical keyboard due to dust and debris, shake out the keyboard gently. Remove the affected keycaps and use compressed air to blow out the switch area or clean the area with a nylon brush. If all else fails, replace the switch to fix the issue.
