# Unleash Your Inner Artist with This Simple Trick to Create the Perfect Best Nine Collage on Instagram!

Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world, with millions of users sharing photos and videos every day. One trend that has taken over Instagram every year is the "Best Nine" collage, which showcases the top nine photos of your year in one image.

Creating the perfect Best Nine collage can seem daunting, but with this simple trick, you can unleash your inner artist and create a stunning collage that will impress your followers. Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Choose the Right Photos

The first step in creating a Best Nine collage is choosing the right photos. Think about the moments that meant the most to you over the past year and choose photos that capture those memories. Make sure to select high-quality photos that will look great in a collage.

Step 2: Crop Your Photos

Once you've chosen your photos, it's time to crop them. You want your Best Nine collage to look clean and organized, so make sure all of your photos are the same size and shape. Use a photo editing app to crop your photos into squares or rectangles, depending on the look you're going for.

Step 3: Choose a Grid Layout

Next, you need to choose a grid layout for your Best Nine collage. There are plenty of apps that can help you do this, but our personal favorite is Canva. Canva offers a wide range of grid layouts that you can choose from, allowing you to customize your Best Nine collage exactly how you want it.

Step 4: Add Your Photos to the Grid

Once you've chosen your grid layout, it's time to add your photos to the grid. This is where you'll get to unleash your inner artist and get creative! Experiment with different placements for your photos, and don't be afraid to overlap them or add borders for added visual interest.

Step 5: Add Text or Graphics

Finally, you can add text or graphics to your Best Nine collage to give it an extra pop of personality. Consider adding your Instagram handle or a quote that represents your year. Canva offers a wide range of text and graphic options that you can use to customize your collage even further.

In conclusion, creating a Best Nine collage on Instagram doesn't have to be a daunting task. With this simple trick, you can unleash your inner artist and create a stunning collage that will impress your followers. Start with choosing the right photos, crop them, choose a grid layout, add your photos, and finally, add that extra pop of text or graphics. Happy sharing!

The method is straightforward for public profiles but private accounts need to perform a few extra steps. Now, let’s get on with it.
 
## Make Best Nine Collage On Instagram
 
- Visit the following website – 2017bestnine.com from your smartphone.
 - Type your Instagram username/Id and tap on Get.

 

 
With this, the tool will start processing and scanning your photos. You might have to wait for up to 10 minutes as there are a lot of requests. For me, I had to wait for 30-40 seconds. You can leave the page and come back later to see your collage.
 
After your image is created select the Photo Only version to hide likes details. In order to save the image tap on it. The image will load in the new tab. Long press on it and select Save Image. Once you have the picture you can upload it as usual on Instagram.
 
Alternatively, you can use their app. It is available for both Android and iOS.
 
The site or the app won’t work for Private profiles. There are 2 options to get the collage for private accounts.
 
Option 1
 
Switch your profile to Public for a few minutes and use the method above. You can change the profile to private again once you have the best nine picture.
 
Option 2
 
Create your collage by manually picking the pictures and use the Instagram’s Layout app to arrange them in a grid. Using this method will take time but you can select the photos depending on your liking and not only the ones that have more likes.
 
We hope you were able to get your best nine collage on Instagram. Don’t forget to share the article on social media so that others are also able to see theirs.
