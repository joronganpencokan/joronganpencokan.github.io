# You won't believe how Hotmail just took your email security to the next level with this new feature!

Hotmail, which is now known as Outlook.com, has been one of the most popular email services around the world for more than two decades now. It has always been innovative and has won over new users with its exciting features, interface, and most importantly, security.

Speaking of security, Hotmail has recently introduced a new feature that has taken its email security to another level. This feature is so impressive that you won't believe it until you try it.

The new feature is called "Selective Email Forwarding," and it allows you to choose which emails you want to forward to another email address. The idea behind this feature is simple, but the benefit is massive. You can now avoid forwarding spam, hoax emails, or phishing emails, thus reducing your chances of falling prey to cybercriminals.

How does this new feature work?

To use selective email forwarding, all you have to do is enable it in your Hotmail account. Once you have done that, you can set up the email addresses that you want to forward specific emails to.

To do this, follow these simple steps:

1. Log in to your Hotmail account and go to the "Settings" menu.

2. Click on "View all Outlook settings."

3. Go to the "Email" tab and select "Forwarding."

4. Enable the "Enable forwarding" option.

5. Enter the email address that you want to forward specific emails to.

6. Select the "Only forward emails that match these criteria" option and set up your filters.

7. Click on "Save" to save the changes.

With these simple steps, you can now set up selective email forwarding to avoid forwarding unwanted emails.

Why is selective email forwarding so important?

Cybercriminals are getting smarter by the day. They are using sophisticated techniques to trick people into revealing their personal and financial information. According to a recent report by the FBI, more than $1.7 billion was lost to cybercriminals in the US alone in 2019.

One of the most common ways that cybercriminals use is phishing emails. These are fake emails that look like they come from legitimate sources, such as banks or government agencies, but they are designed to steal your information.

With selective email forwarding, you can avoid forwarding phishing emails or spam emails to your other email accounts. This reduces your chances of falling prey to cybercriminals and losing your sensitive information.

In conclusion, Hotmail, now known as Outlook.com, has always been at the forefront of email security. Its latest feature, selective email forwarding, takes email security to another level. By enabling this feature and setting up your filters, you can avoid forwarding unwanted emails and reduce your chances of falling prey to cybercriminals. So, if you're a Hotmail user, go ahead and try the selective email forwarding feature. You won't be disappointed!

Starting today Hotmail is offering HTTPS data encryption option for the full session of your connection using SSL* (Secure Socket Layer) to enhance the security, providing users peace of mind and helping to protect their information from hackers and fraud.
 
Other services are also getting the enhanced security, SkyDrive, Docs, Photos and Devices pages, now are transferring encrypted data via HTTPS. If security was the reason holding you back on using these services, this new security option can give you a little more confides that your data will be safer.
 
This new feature is not on by default, so to boost the security of your Hotmail inbox, contacts, and calendar, go to https://account.live.com/ManageSSL, login and select Use HTTPS automatically and click Save. Now all your future connections with Hotmail will be using SSL.
 
The down side is that HTTPS doesn’t work with all the services. It is important that you know that trying to gain access Hotmail via these services will cause errors:
 
- Outlook Hotmail Connector
 - Windows Live Mail
 - The Windows Live application for Windows Mobile (version 6.5 and earlier) and Nokia.
