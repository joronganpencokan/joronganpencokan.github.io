# Unlock the Secret to Lightning-Fast Sugarcane Growth in Minecraft - Become a Pro Farmer Now!

Minecraft is a fascinating game loved by gamers of all ages. From exploring the vast world to building impressive structures, there is always something exciting to do in Minecraft. Among the many activities players can engage in is farming, a vital aspect of the game that allows players to cultivate their crops, breed animals, and create their own food. One of the most profitable crops is sugarcane, which is used in many crafting recipes. If you want to become a pro farmer and unlock the secret to lightning-fast sugarcane growth in Minecraft, we have got you covered.

## Planting and Harvesting Sugarcane 

To start, you need to know how to plant and harvest sugarcane in Minecraft. Sugarcane can be planted on sand, dirt, grass, and even sugar blocks. You obtain sugarcane from crafting a sugar block in a 3x3 crafting grid using nine sugar cane stalks. Once you have your sugarcane, you can plant them. You can plant each cane in a straight line, ensuring that there is at least one block of water adjacent to each cane. Once the plant matures, you can harvest it by breaking the top block of the mature cane with any tool or even your hand.

## Boosting Sugarcane Growth 

One of the secrets to lightning-fast sugarcane growth in Minecraft is bone meal. Bone meal is a fertilizer that speeds up the growth of crops, including sugarcane. To use bone meal on sugarcane, select it from your inventory and use it on the mature cane. The cane will instantly grow to its maximum height, ready for harvesting. Bone meal is an excellent way to boost sugarcane growth, but it's not the only way.

Another way to improve sugarcane growth is by creating an ideal environment for the plant to flourish. Sugarcane requires a lot of sunlight, so plant it in an area that is well-lit. If you are planting sugarcane in a cave, you will need to provide artificial light using torches or glowstones. Additionally, make sure that there is plenty of water near the plant. Sugarcane requires water to grow, and if you don't have enough water, the plant's growth will be stunted.

## Creating a Sugarcane Farm 

If you want to cultivate sugarcane on a larger scale and increase your yield, you need to create a sugarcane farm. A sugarcane farm is a plot of land that is dedicated to the cultivation of sugarcane. To create a sugarcane farm, you will need to clear an area of land and dig a series of trenches. The trenches should be two blocks deep and one block wide, with water flowing through each one. Plant the sugarcane along the edge of the trenches, ensuring that each cane has access to water.

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, sugarcane is a profitable crop in Minecraft that can be cultivated and harvested for use in crafting recipes. To unlock the secret to lightning-fast sugarcane growth in Minecraft and become a pro farmer, use bone meal to boost the plant's growth, create an ideal environment for the plant to flourish, and create a sugarcane farm for maximum yield. With these tips, you will be well on your way to becoming a successful sugarcane farmer in Minecraft.

Knowing how to grow Sugarcane faster in Minecraft will be of great help to you in-game. It is of great importance as a crafting item in survival mode. As a Minecraft gamer, you will notice how sugarcane takes annoyingly forever to grow. To add to this, you need to be within 64 blocks to get your sugarcane to grow. Thankfully, you can speed up this process. Within the game, there exist a few ways in which you can execute them! For that, we’ve crafted this guide to teach you how to make your sugarcane grow faster in Minecraft. So follow the steps mentioned below and get your sugarcane ready without hitting that annoyingly long wait time!
 
## How To Make Sugarcane Grow Faster In Minecraft?
 
There are 2 ways you can get your sugarcane to grow quickly on Minecraft. We’ve mentioned both of them in this list. Here’s how you can quickly farm sugarcane on Minecraft:
 
- Head to the water body or block where you wish to plant your block to plant sugarcane and plant it.
 - After you’ve done this, use some bonemeal on your sugarcane.
 - Your sugarcane will grow and you can now harvest it.
 - Remember to harvest it from the second layer up and not from the first.

 
Now while this method is really easy and works perfectly, there is a humungous drawback- It doesn’t run on Java edition. Fret not, we’ve also got a method for those who play the java version. This method is the infamous zero tick method which in addition to the zero tick count, uses Redstone pulses. Follow the steps below and you’ll be farming sugarcane at the speed of light! Keep in mind that as patches and updates keep coming to the game, these methods might or might not work. This method currently works for the Java edition as well as other editions.
 
 
 

 
Method 2: Zero Tick For 1.16 Java and Bedrock:
 
This method below will show you how to use the zero tick method to build a sugarcane farm and get sugarcane to grow quickly in Minecraft!
 
- Firstly, gather the following:
 - 12 Redstone dust
 - 1 Redstone torch
 - 2 Redstone repeaters
 - 1 Lever
 - Building blocks(any kind)
 - 2 Dispensers
 - 2 Hoppers
 - Chests
 - 2 glass panes
 - Stairs
 - Dirt blocks
 - 2 Pistons
 - Water buckets
 - Start by making an arrangement such that your blocks look like a “T” and then proceed to break the center block.
 - Place a lever on the rightmost block and place a Redstone torch under that same block.
 - Put a repeater in the center where you broke the block.
 - Now under the leftmost block, drop some Redstone dust and bring it out by 2 spaces.
 - After that, leave a block to the right from the last spot of Redstone dust and place an arrangement of two blocks behind that space.
 - In addition to the spaces left for the arrangement, leave a block’s length space on the right side of that arrangement and build an arrangement of 2 more blocks such that both arrangements are parallel to one another.
 - Place 2 dispensers facing up on the end of each of those two blocks at either arrangement.
 - Crouch and place stairs on the leftmost block.
 - In order to get all of these connected, link your Redstone dust to the system in a line.
 - Proceed to build 2 temporary blocks next to the right block- these will be broken.
 - Place a chest on top of these and break the blocks.
 - In order to gather your sugarcane- on top of the right dispenser, place the hopper such that it’s directing into the chest.
 - Now place more blocks at the front and back of the arrangement, leaving the middle empty– that’s where you’ll put dirt to grow your sugarcane
 - Place 9 builds of glass on each side and make sure you put both your glass panes halfway over the hopper.
 - You may now place dirt blocks in the empty space in the center, remember you can make it as long as you want.
 - Now just after the dirt blocks, place another temporary block. Put a piston on that block and break then break the block.
 - In front of the left block where you placed the final line of Redstone dust, place a Redstone repeater on the right.
 - Now create a staircase arrangement using the blocks all the way to the piston and drop Redstone dust along this path to connect the piston.
 - As soon as you’ve done this, take 2 water buckets and deposit them in the 2 dispensers.
 - Once you’ve done that-hit the lever once and then shut the lever down.
 - Remove the water from the right dispenser and then hit the lever to start, and stop it again.
 - Now put the water back in the right dispenser- this will cause the water to alternate the flow and create a motion for the pistons.
 - This motion is exactly what causes the zero tick in the game.
 - Now just plant your sugarcane and quickly encase the remaining part of the upper setup in glass to prevent the sugarcane from falling out.
 - Furthermore, also set up a hopper below the chest and add another chest or simply make it a double chest. You can stop the farm by hitting the lever to stop and start it up as you need.

 
This might seem a bit overwhelming at first and a bit complex to deal with, however, this is how you’ll be able to gain a far superior yield of sugarcane and use it to get sugar and paper. This method was made specifically for java players since the bonemeal method eluded them. However, if you wish to farm sugarcane in a similar setup in bedrock, you can do so by placing a dispenser next to the sugarcane and adding bonemeal to it, then connecting this to the Redstone dust. You can choose to make different setups and play around with the resources you have. Minecraft has always demanded creativity and it shows since the game has never really “taught” players the game!
