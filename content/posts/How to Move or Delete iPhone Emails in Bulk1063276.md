##   Move or Delete Email Automatically  
 

Delete or move emails automatically if you find yourself managing messages from the same sender each time you get them. For example, to move an email from your brother into a Family folder or your online purchase confirmations into a Receipts folder.

 

To automatically manage emails, use email filters and rules, which the iOS Mail app doesn't support. However, some email providers do, in which case you can set up the email filters from a web browser through the webmail service. As long as you use IMAP on your iPhone to access the emails, the filters will apply on your phone, too.

 

The technique for setting up email rules is different for each email provider, but it's usually self-explanatory. For example, creating email rules in Gmail isn't the same as filtering emails in Yahoo Mail.

 
Using IMAP from your phone is the same as loading the emails from the mail server. When emails on the server are moved or deleted through filters, the same folders are affected on your iPhone.
