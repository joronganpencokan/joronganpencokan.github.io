# Uncover the Dark Secrets in Hitman 3's Dartmoor Mystery - Learn How to Find the Elusive Case Files!

Fans of the Hitman franchise will be excited to dive into the newest installment, Hitman 3, which promises to be a thrilling ride full of mysteries and assassinations. One of the standout missions of the game is the Dartmoor mystery, which is a perfect example of the intricate and gripping storytelling that the series is known for.

Set in an English manor, the mission revolves around Agent 47's investigation of a supposed suicide, which quickly turns into a tangled web of family secrets, hidden agendas, and deadly cover-ups. Players will have to use all their stealth and cunning to navigate the sprawling estate, gather clues, and make their way to the truth. But one key element that will help them uncover the dark secrets of Dartmoor is the elusive case files that hold crucial information about the victim and the suspects.

So, how can players find these case files and use them to their advantage? Let's break it down:

## Step 1: Gain Access to the Manor

Before players can get their hands on the case files, they need to infiltrate the estate and reach the area where the files are stored. There are several ways to do this, depending on the player's approach and preferred playstyle. For example, they can pose as a member of staff, sneak in through a side entrance, or disguise themselves as a guest.

The key is to be patient and observant, taking note of the security measures, guard patrols, and potential disguises or items that could help them blend in. Once they have a clear plan of action, they can make their move and start exploring the house.

## Step 2: Search for Clues and Evidence

Once inside the manor, players will need to gather as much information as possible to piece together the mystery. This includes searching for clues such as diaries, letters, photographs, and other items that shed light on the victim's past, relationships, and motives. Players should also eavesdrop on conversations, watch for suspicious behavior, and take note of any hints or rumors they hear.

It's worth noting that the case files themselves are not immediately visible or accessible, but they can be found by piecing together various clues and leads. Players should keep a mental or physical note of any references to the files they come across.

## Step 3: Locate the Case Files

Once players have gathered enough clues and evidence, they will have a clearer idea of where the case files might be located. The files themselves are held in a secure room with a keypad lock, which players will need to hack or acquire the code for. The code can be found by examining a few specific items and overhearing certain conversations, so players should be sure to thoroughly explore their surroundings.

Once players have accessed the room, they can finally get their hands on the case files and read through them to gain valuable insights into the case. The files provide a detailed account of the victim's death, as well as profiles of the main suspects and their potential motives. They also include an important piece of evidence that players can use to confront the killer and bring them to justice.

## Step 4: Use the Case Files to Solve the Mystery

Armed with the case files and all the other clues they have gathered, players can finally piece together the mystery of Dartmoor and identify the killer. Depending on their approach, they can choose to confront the killer directly, use the evidence to blackmail them or manipulate them, or find a way to discreetly eliminate them without raising suspicion.

The beauty of Hitman 3's Dartmoor mystery is that there are multiple paths and outcomes, depending on the player's choices and actions. By following the steps above and using the case files as a crucial tool, players can enjoy a thrilling and satisfying experience that showcases the best of the Hitman franchise.
