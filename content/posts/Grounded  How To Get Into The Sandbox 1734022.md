**What is a Sandbox Game?**

If you're not familiar with the term 'sandbox game,' let me give you a brief overview. Unlike traditional games that are linear and have set objectives, a sandbox game allows you to create your gameplay experience. You're given a vast and open virtual world to explore and play with in your way, with no preset missions or goals. It's a game where your imagination is the limit, and you can create whatever you like, from buildings to landscapes, and even entire universes!

**Introducing the Latest Sandbox Game – Minecraft!**

Minecraft is the latest and most talked-about sandbox game, which has taken the gaming world by storm. Developed by Mojang Studios, Minecraft is a game that lets you create your virtual world by placing and breaking blocks in a three-dimensional world. You can explore this vast world, gather resources, and create everything from buildings to tools while fighting off any enemies that may appear.

**How to Get Started with Minecraft**

Getting started with Minecraft is effortless, and it's available on almost all platforms, including PC, consoles, and mobile devices. The first step is to purchase the game, and then you're free to unleash your creativity!

Upon starting the game, you'll be placed in a vast virtual world known as the “overworld,” and you're free to start building whatever you like. You can start by gathering resources such as wood, stone, and iron, and then use them to craft tools and build structures.

Minecraft offers ‘survival’ and ‘creative’ modes, and these modes determine how you play the game. Survival mode puts you into a world where you have to gather resources to survive while fighting off any enemies that may appear. Creative mode, on the other hand, puts you into a world where you can create whatever you like without any restrictions.

**Let Your Imagination Run Wild!**

The beauty of Minecraft is that it lets you unleash your imagination and create anything you like. Whether you want to build a small cottage or an entire city, the choice is yours. You can create entire landscapes, including mountains, lakes, and beaches, and populate them with wildlife, flowers, and trees.

Moreover, Minecraft offers a multiplayer mode, where you can collaborate with other players to create incredible masterpieces. Minecraft is not just a game; it's an entire universe of possibilities, and the limit is your imagination.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, Minecraft is the perfect game to let go of all that inhibits you and unleash your inner child. With no set objectives, you're given the freedom to create, build, and explore to your heart's content. The game's simplicity, combined with its vastness, will keep you entertained for hours on end. So what are you waiting for? Jump into the exciting world of Minecraft and unleash your creativity!

Grounded is a first and third-person survival video game heavily inspired by movies like Disney’s Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, and A bug’s Life. That being said, you won’t run out of collecting, crafting, and exploring while dodging the hurdles. With the recent Hot and Hazy update, you will encounter a massive Sandbox in the game. As players enter this sandbox, they will face several dangerous creatures, debuffs, and the sizzle effect. But new players are unable to infiltrate and get inside this sandbox. Not to worry, here’s our guide that explains how to get into the Sandbox in Grounded.
 
## How to Get into the Sandbox in Grounded
 
Unlike several biomes, you don’t require a key to enter the Sandbox. Instead, you need to climb your way to the Picnic table to get inside the Sandbox. So, follow the below steps to get inside the Sandbox in Grounded:
 
- As you head southeast of the Sandbox, you will find a Leaning Shovel by the picnic table. This shovel will be placed with the support of a Cracked Rock.
 - You can use some explosives to blow the rock. As you do so, the shovel will fall onto the table to form a bridge.
 - Then, you need to climb over the shovel to reach the table.
 - The half-eaten lunch will spawn several swarming bees around the table. So, be cautious to not engage with them and head in the opposite direction.
 - Upon heading further, you will find and discover the Apricop Punch-O.
 - Head further to find a wooden bridge connecting to a pile of books.

 
- As you head further, you will find the book of Dungeons & Dragons leading you to ramp to the top.
 - While there are plenty of things around this region, head inside the gap below the orange-colored book.
 - You will discover the Field Station and a Zip Line Anchor.

 
- You can use the pre-set Zipline to get into the Sandbox directly.
 - But you need 12 Silk Ropes to use the anchor. Once you zip line, you will reach your way down into the Sandbox biome.
