# Revolutionary! Google's Latest Big Move: Instant Access To Android Apps Without Any Installation Required!

Google has once again made waves in the tech industry with its latest move: instant access to Android apps without any prior installation. This new feature is a part of Google's Play Store and allows users to use apps directly without downloading and installing them on their devices. 

This move by Google is a major step forward in the world of mobile technology. It eliminates the need to download and install apps, saving users time and storage space on their devices. With the increasing number of apps available today, device storage is becoming a major issue, and this new feature addresses this problem. 

The process of accessing an app using this new feature is quite simple. Instead of downloading an app from the Play Store, users can simply click on a "Try Now" button that appears when they search for an app. The app will then launch instantly in a virtual environment within the user's web browser. 

This means that users can try out an app before deciding whether or not they want to download it. They can get a feel for the app, try out some of its features, and then decide if they want to install it on their device. This feature is particularly useful for apps that are large in size or require a lot of storage space. 

The virtual environment in which the app runs is similar to an emulator, and it allows the app to run smoothly and without any lag. This means that users can experience the full functionality of the app without any performance issues. 

This new feature by Google has the potential to change the way we interact with apps. It will make it easier for users to discover new apps and try them out without the fear of wasting storage space on their device. It will also make it easier for developers to reach a wider audience by allowing users to try out their apps without any prior installation. 

Furthermore, this new feature will make it easier for Google to implement changes and updates to apps. Instead of needing to update an app on a user's device, Google can simply update the virtual environment that the app runs on. This means that users will have access to the latest version of an app without needing to update it on their device. 

In conclusion, Google's latest move of providing instant access to Android apps without any installation required is a game-changer in the world of mobile technology. It is a major step forward in addressing the issue of device storage and will make it easier for users to discover and try out new apps. It will also make it easier for developers to reach a wider audience and for Google to implement changes and updates to apps. This new feature is without a doubt revolutionary, and we can't wait to see its full potential in the future.

During Google I/O developer conference the company introduced Android Instant Apps, which is a new feature for Google Play apps that aims to make all apps available to users at any time without installation.
 
The main idea with Instant Apps on Android N is to bring users more quickly into using new apps, while removing the friction of having to tap many times to download and install app before they can get to the same place in the app.
 
## Here’s how Android Instant Apps works
 
Suppose, you get a link from a friend on a text message to a video that is only available on a specific app. Without the Instant Apps functionality, you need to click the link, jump to the Google Play store, click Install, wait for the download and installation, and then click Open to launch the app — easily wasting a few minutes –. With the new feature, you can now simply tap the link and your Android N smartphone will automatically and seamlessly load the content as if you had the app already installed in your handset.
 
What Android Instant Apps does is to split the app into modules and only load the necessary code to load the place on the app you need to access. However, if you were to choose to get the app, you can simply click the Install button on the top right.
 
Developers will be able to take advantage of the feature by upgrading their existing apps. Google explains that you won’t need to create a different app, you will only need to modify the code to accommodate the new functionality. The company claims that you can get the new integration in your app as soon as in one day — depending on the complexity of the app.
 
If you’re an Android user, please don’t get too excited right away, as instant apps will be available sometime in 2017 when Android N is running on enough devices. Currently, Google is working with a small number of developers, but the company plans to gradually open the doors to more developers in the near future.
