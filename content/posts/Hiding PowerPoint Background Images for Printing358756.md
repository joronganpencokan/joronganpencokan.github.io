Title: Discover the Game-Changing Secret to Perfect Printouts - Hide Powerpoint Background Images Now!

Introduction:

PowerPoint, without any doubt, is one of the most widely used presentation tools in the corporate world. It has established itself as the go-to tool for creating visually appealing and engaging presentations. Its features such as animations, graphics, and background themes have contributed towards its popularity. However, there is one feature that power users may want to reconsider using – the background image.

Body:

In PowerPoint, the background image is a design element that serves as the base or foundation for the presentation. It can be a simple color or a complex image. Background images are often used to add a personal touch to presentations and establish a theme or branding.

However, while the background image looks great during the presentation, it can be problematic when it comes to printing. When the presentation is printed, the background image can interfere with the legibility of the text, and the result may not be pleasing to the eye.

The solution to this problem is to hide the background image before printing the presentation. This ensures that the printed pages have a clear and sharp appearance, allowing the text to stand out without any distractions.

Hiding the background image in PowerPoint is straightforward. Here are the steps to get it done:

1. Select the "Design" tab from the ribbon.

2. Click on "Background Styles" and then click on "Format Background."

3. This opens the Format Background dialog box. From there, select the "Picture or Texture Fill" option, and then click on the "File" button.

4. Locate the background image that you want to hide and select it. Once selected, click on the "Insert" button.

5. Finally, click on the "Close" button to close the dialog box and save the changes.

Once the background image is hidden, you can now feel confident about printing your PowerPoint presentation without worrying about its appearance.

Conclusion:

PowerPoint is an amazing tool for creating presentations, but its features such as background images can sometimes be problematic. Hiding the background image before printing is the solution to achieving sharp and clear printouts. With a few clicks, you can easily hide the background image and enhance the legibility of your PowerPoint presentations. So, start implementing this game-changing secret to perfect printouts and take your PowerPoint presentations to the next level!

Using a design template adds an attractive appeal to your presentation. The brightly colored templates are eye-catching and bring a professional air to your presentation. However, for printing purposes, the background graphics that look so good on screen hinder the readability of the slides on the handouts. A simple process suppresses the background graphics temporarily.

 
##   Remove Background Images in Printed Slides  
 

Before printing your presentation slides, handouts, and notes, hide the background image to make it easier to read the printed pages.

 
Instructions in this article apply to PowerPoint 2019, 2016, 2013, 2010; PowerPoint for Mac, and PowerPoint for Microsoft 365.
 
- Go to Design.
 - In the Customize group, select Format Background to display the Format Background pane.
 - In the Fill section, place a checkmark next to Hide Background Graphics.
 - The background graphics disappear from each slide and the presentation can be printed without the background images. To toggle the background graphics back on, remove the checkmark next to Hide Background Graphics.

 
##   Print in Monochrome for Additional Clarity  
 

Slides may be hard to read if you print them in a light color. Printing in grayscale or solid black shows only the text on a white background. This setting makes the slides easy to read and all the important content is still present.

 

Go to Design.

 

In the Customize group, select Format Background to display the Format Background pane.

 

In the Fill section, place a checkmark next to Hide Background Graphics. 

 

The background graphics disappear from each slide and the presentation can be printed without the background images. To toggle the background graphics back on, remove the checkmark next to Hide Background Graphics.

 

To make this change, go to File > Print and select Grayscale or Pure Black and White, instead of Color.
