# Unleash Your Inner DJ: Google's Latest Music Beta Allows Free Streaming of 20,000 Songs!

Google has recently launched a new music service application, Google Music, which allows users to upload and stream up to 20,000 songs for free. The music beta service is available for a select few people, but the beta sign-up is open for all. 

Google Music is said to be a direct rival of other music providers such as Spotify, Amazon, and Apple. However, Google Music is unique in its functionalities and helpful features that make it stand out. With Google Music, users can store 20,000 of their favorite songs on the cloud, which means you don't need to keep up a local copy of it.

Moreover, Google Music has an awesome feature that allows users to create custom mixes. Google Music uses a technology called "Instant Mix," which mixes your favorite songs together on the playlist. It's an intelligent tool that will help you separate your favorite songs from others, thanks to the service's amazing rating system. 

Another great feature of Google Music is its compatibility feature, which allows users to access their music from mobile devices. Google Music works on smartphones that run on Android 2.2 and above, including tablets. This makes it easier to access your playlist on-the-go.

Furthermore, Google Music is user-frendly and easy to use. Just upload your music from your computer, and you are ready to go. You won't need to worry about manually organizing and sorting your music the way you would when using a traditional music library. Google Music lets you do everything you want to do with your music all online.

If you are passionate about music and enjoy streaming music that suits your taste, then Google Music is the best platform for you. With the Google Music beta service, you can discover and save music, create playlists, and share them easily with others. 

In conclusion, whether you're a student, a music lover, or a professional DJ, Google Music is the perfect music streaming service for you. With its unique features, easy-to-navigate interface, and the ability to store and stream your own music collection, this service is perfect for anyone looking for an excellent music streaming experience! So, go ahead and unleash your inner DJ with Google Music Beta!

The giant of search has introduced Music Beta at the annual Google I/O conference; this is a new service that will let you upload your own music (up to 20,000 songs) for free to the Google Cloud and stream your personal collection back on any computer, tablet or, of course, any Android device — any device that supports Flash — at home or on the go.
 
Music Beta has other features as well, like for example the music that you upload and the playlists that you create will be kept always in sync, this means that if you created a playlist on your phone, it will be immediately available on your computer or tablet. You can upload any music folder or your iTunes library and all the playlists, and when you add more music to your computer, it can be uploaded automatically to your personal collection online. Like in Zune and iTunes service, Music Beta by Google has a feature called Instant Mix that will automatically create new playlists out of the songs from your personal collection that just sound great together. Another great feature from this new Google service is that you are going to have the ability to listen your favorite tunes even when you are offline; Music Beta will automatically store the most resent played music on your Android device and you can specify the albums, artists or playlists to be available when you are disconnected from the internet.
 
The Music Beta by Google is live now, but you are going to need to request an invitation to use the service and for now is only available to the U.S.
