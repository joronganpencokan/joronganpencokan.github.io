Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is the seventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series of games, and the third and final release in the GTA 3 line. These three games use the same underlying game engine and have a similar look and feel.

 

In GTA: San Andreas players assume the role of Carl "CJ" Johnson, who has recently returned home to Los Santos, a fictional city based on Los Angeles. The game takes place in the early 1990s and has CJ taking on odd jobs for a corrupt policeman in order to avoid being framed for a murder he did not commit. Included in the "jobs" that CJ must complete are bank heists, drug deals, assaults, and other criminal undertakings.

 

Similar to other GTA titles, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas takes place in an open world where players have the ability to complete the main story missions at their own pace while taking on side quests. Side quests are useful for Carl in order to increase his reputation and obtain new items, properties, and vehicles that can be used at different phases of the game.

 

At the time of its release in 2004, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas featured the largest game world in the series. Missions have characters traveling to other cities beyond Los Santos, including San Fierro and Las Venturas, which are based on San Francisco and Las Vegas, respectively. The name San Andreas represents the fictional state that mirrors California.

 

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, like many in the GTA series, was not without controversy. Shortly after the PC release, it was pulled from store shelves after a fan-created mod called Hot Coffee unlocked previously hidden sexually explicit scenes. These scenes were eventually unlocked for the Xbox and PlayStation versions as well.

 

As a result, the game's rating was changed from M (for Mature) to Adult Only and forced out of stores. After some weeks in development, it was re-released without the sexually explicit content and its "M for Mature" rating was restored.
