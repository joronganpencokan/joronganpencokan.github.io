Are you aware that your computer has a hidden treasure chest within its Hkey Users HKU Registry Hive? Most computer users are unaware of this powerful tool, which contains countless gems to enhance your computing experience. Tinkering with your registry is not recommended for novices, but for those who know what they are doing, it can open up a whole new world of possibilities. 

For the uninitiated, the registry contains an extensive database of configuration settings and options for the Windows operating system. It is a hierarchical database where all the settings are stored in keys and values. The HKU registry hive is one of the five primary registry hives that are created on Windows operating system startup. 

Now that you know what the Hkey Users HKU Registry Hive is, let's delve into some amazing hidden treasures! 

Firstly, you can customize your Windows desktop and lock screen with third-party themes by tweaking the registry. Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop and find the value "Wallpaper." Then, you can modify this value by inserting the path to your desired wallpaper. You can also go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Colors to customize your desktop's colors. 

Secondly, you can personalize the context menu, which appears when you right-click on an item in Windows. By visiting HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AllFilesystemObjects\shell, you will find a list of context menu items you can add, remove or modify to suit your preferences. 

Thirdly, you can speed up your computer's performance by disabling unnecessary startup programs. Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run and look for startup programs that are not essential. By removing those programs, your computer will start up faster. 

Finally, you can modify how frequently your computer checks for Windows updates, which can be useful if you have a limited internet connection. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\Auto Update and find the value "AUOptions." Then, set the value to "2" to check for updates only manually. 

In conclusion, the Hkey Users HKU registry hive is a treasure trove of customization options for your computer. However, caution is advised when editing your registry as it can cause irreparable damage if not done correctly. We suggest creating a backup of your registry before making any changes or consulting a professional for assistance. Unlock the hidden gems lurking in your computer's registry hive with care and enjoy a more personalized computing experience.



HKEY_USERS, sometimes seen as HKU, is one of many registry hives in the Windows Registry.

 

It contains user-specific configuration information for all currently active users on the computer. This means the user logged in at the moment (you) and any other users who have also logged in but have since "switched users."

 

Each registry key located under the HKEY_USERS hive corresponds to a user on the system and is named with that user's security identifier, or SID. The registry keys and registry values located under each SID control settings specific to that user, like mapped drives, installed printers, environment variables, desktop background, and much more, and is loaded when the user first logs on.

 
##   How to Get to HKEY_USERS  
 

Being a registry hive, it's easy to find and open via Registry Editor:

 
- Open Registry Editor. The quickest way to do that in all versions of Windows is by launching the Run dialog box (WIN+R) and entering regedit.
 - Locate HKEY_USERS from the left pane.
 - Select HKEY_USERS or expand the hive using the small arrow or plus icon to the left.

 
###   Don't See HKEY_USERS?  
 

If Registry Editor has been used on this computer before, you may need to collapse (minimize) any open registry keys until you see the hive.

 

Open Registry Editor. The quickest way to do that in all versions of Windows is by launching the Run dialog box (WIN+R) and entering regedit.

 

Locate HKEY_USERS from the left pane.

 

Select HKEY_USERS or expand the hive using the small arrow or plus icon to the left.

 
It's always a good idea to make a backup of any registry keys that you plan on editing. See How to Back Up the Windows Registry if you need help backing up the whole registry or specific parts of the registry to a REG file.
 

The easiest way to reach HKEY_USERS when other keys are open is to scroll to the very top of the left side of Registry Editor, and select the arrow or plus sign to the left of any other open registry hives.

 

For example, you might need to collapse HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE in order to see the HKEY_USERS hive.

 
##   Registry Subkeys in HKEY_USERS  
 

Here's an example of what you might find under this hive:

 
- HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULTHKEY_USERS\S-1-5-18HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-19HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-20HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-0123456789-012345678-0123456789-1004HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-0123456789-012345678-0123456789-1004_Classes...

 

The SIDs you see listed here will certainly differ than the list we included above.

 

While you'll likely have .DEFAULT, S-1-5-18, S-1-5-19, and S-1-5-20, which correspond to built-in system accounts, your S-1-5-21-xxx keys will be unique to your computer since they correspond to "real" user accounts in Windows.

 
##   More on HKEY_USERS & SIDs  
 

The HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive acts as a kind of shortcut to the HKEY_USERS subkey corresponding to your SID.

 

In other words, when you make changes in HKEY_CURRENT_USER, you're making changes to the keys and values under the key within HKEY_USERS that's named the same as your SID.

 

For example, if your SID is the following:

 

S-1-5-21-0123456789-012345678-0123456789-1004

 

...HKEY_CURRENT_USER will point to this:

 

HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-0123456789-012345678-0123456789-1004

 

Edits can be made in either location since they are one in the same.

 

If you want to change registry data for a user whose SID is not appearing under HKEY_USERS, you can either log in as that user and make the change, or you can load the registry hive of that user manually. See How to Load a Registry Hive if you need help.

 

The HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT subkey is the exact same as the HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-18 subkey. Any changes made to one are automatically and instantly reflected in the other, in the exact same way that the currently logged on user's SID subkey in HKEY_USERS is identical to the values found in HKEY_CURRENT_USER.

 
Remember that since the two are the same, if you're editing your own settings (the settings for the user you're currently logged in as), it's much easier to simply open HKEY_CURRENT_USER than to identify your own SID and then make the changes within HKEY_USERS. Using HKEY_USERS to access the SID folder for a user is usually only useful if you need to edit registry values for a user who isn't currently logged in.
 

It's also important to know that HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT is used by the LocalSystem account, not a regular user account. It's common to mistake this key for one that can be edited so that its changes are applied to all the users, considering that it's called "default," but this isn't the case.

 

Two of the other HKEY_USERS subkeys in Windows Registry that are used by system accounts include S-1-5-19 which is for the LocalService account and S-1-5-20 which is used by the NetworkService account.
