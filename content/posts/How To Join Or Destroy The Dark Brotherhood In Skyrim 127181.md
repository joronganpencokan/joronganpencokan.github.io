Unleash Your Inner Assassin: Learn How to Join or Wipe Out the Infamous Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim

If you've ever played Skyrim, you know that it's a game full of choices. You can choose to be a brave warrior, a powerful mage, or a stealthy thief. However, one of the most intriguing choices in the game is the option to join or destroy the notorious Dark Brotherhood. This shadowy organization is filled with skilled assassins and deadly secrets. Are you ready to unleash your inner assassin and learn how to join, or wipe out, this infamous group? We've got you covered.

Joining the Dark Brotherhood

If you want to join the Dark Brotherhood, you need to be a sneak, a thief, and a killer. The first step is to complete the quest "Innocence Lost." This quest can be started in Windhelm by talking to Aventus Aretino, a young boy who wants you to help him contact the Dark Brotherhood. Once you begin this quest, you'll be tasked with eliminating Grelod the Kind, the cruel owner of the Honorhall Orphanage. This will trigger an invitation to join the Dark Brotherhood by cleaning up and sleeping in Aretino's Spell Tome (located on a shelf in his room).

From there, you'll be taken to the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary, where you'll meet Astrid, the leader of the group. Astrid will guide you through various assassination missions, each with its own set of challenges and rewards. Completing these missions will earn you favor with the Brotherhood and lead to more lucrative assassination contracts.

Destroying the Dark Brotherhood

If, on the other hand, you prefer to wipe out this group of assassins, your first step is to talk to Commander Maro at the Penitus Oculatus Outpost in Dragon Bridge. He'll give you the quest "Destroy the Dark Brotherhood!" which requires you to kill Astrid, the leader of the group.

Once you've completed this quest and eliminated all members of the Brotherhood in the Sanctuary, the quest "Death Incarnate" will begin. This series of quests will lead you to a final confrontation with the Brotherhood's remaining leaders, including Cicero, Babette, and Nazir.

When the dust settles, you'll emerge as the savior of Skyrim, and the Dark Brotherhood will be nothing but a distant memory.

The Rewards

Whether you choose to join or destroy the Dark Brotherhood, there are rewards to be had. Joining the group can earn you powerful weapons, armor, and enchanted items. You'll also have access to unique assassination missions that can't be found anywhere else in the game.

Destroying the group, on the other hand, will earn you the gratitude of the Penitus Oculatus, as well as the satisfaction of knowing you've rid Skyrim of a dangerous organization.

Conclusion

Joining or destroying the Dark Brotherhood is one of the most intriguing and challenging choices in Skyrim. Whichever path you choose, you'll need to be a master of stealth, assassination, and combat. Take your time, choose your strategy wisely, and unleash your inner assassin in this epic battle for Skyrim.
