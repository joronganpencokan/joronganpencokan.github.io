# 10 Surprising Tricks to Turbocharge Your Windows 10 Download Speed!

Are you tired of slow Windows 10 download speeds? Do you need to speed up your downloads to save time? In this article, we have gathered some of the best tricks to turbocharge your Windows 10 download speed.

Let's get started!

## 1. Close Unnecessary Applications

One of the biggest culprits behind slow download speeds can be the unnecessary applications running in the background. If you're downloading something important, make sure to close all other applications that are not needed to free up some system resources. 

## 2. Limit the Download Speed 

Limiting the download speed can seem counter-productive but it actually does help. By limiting the download speed, you ensure that your bandwidth is utilized efficiently. Most internet service providers throttle the internet during peak hours, if you limit the speed, you can avoid those restrictions.

## 3. Disable Windows Updates

Windows updates can be a blessing and a curse. They update your system and ensure that it's secure but they can also cause a massive slowdown in your download speeds. Disabling the updates is not advisable but if you're downloading something important, it's best to disable them temporarily.

## 4. Use a Download Manager

Downloading a big file can be interrupted from time to time due to connectivity issues or slow internet speed. However, using a download manager can help you download the file in chunks and resume the download from where it stopped.

## 5. Clear Browser Cache

Your browser's cache stores temporary files that can help load pages quicker. However, over time, the cache can grow to a large size which can hinder the download speeds. Clearing the cache will speed up the download.

## 6. Disable Background Apps

Some apps like Dropbox, OneDrive or Google Drive sync files in the background which can take up all of your bandwidth. Disabling these apps can free up resources necessary for downloading files.

## 7. Connect to Ethernet

Ethernet connections are generally faster than wireless connections. If possible, connect your computer to your router using an Ethernet cable to get faster download speeds.

## 8. Use Best DNS Servers

The default DNS servers provided by your internet provider may not be the fastest. You can use public DNS servers like Google DNS (8.8.8.8) or OpenDNS(208.67.222.222) for faster downloads.

## 9. Disable Firewall or VPN

Firewalls or VPNs can check all the network packets entering into your PC for security reasons. This process can slow down your downloads. Disabling your firewall or VPN temporarily can boost your download speeds.

## 10. Adjust Power Settings 

Windows has a power management feature that can adjust the performance of your computer. Select High Performance mode while downloading to boost the download speed.

By following these ten tricks, you can easily boost your Windows 10 download speed. Don't let slow download speeds frustrate you anymore! Try some of these simple tricks today!

Downloads taking longer than expected on your PC? Here are some tips for how to increase download speeds on Windows 10.

 
##   Why Are My Downloads So Slow in Windows 10?  
 

If downloads are slow and web pages are taking forever to load, the first thing you should do is troubleshoot your slow internet connection. Once you've ruled out any problems with your ISP, router, and modem, move on to troubleshooting your device.

 

There could be many reasons why a computer is running slow, but if you're specifically having problems with the internet, it could be due to the following:

 
- Interference between your device and the router
 - Too many other devices are using your Wi-Fi network
 - Background apps are hogging resources and bandwidth
 - Your connection is metered

 
##   How Can I Boost My Download Speed?  
 

After checking for issues with your internet connection, try these steps to speed up downloads on Windows 10:

 
Test your internet speed and compare it to what your internet provider promises to see if you're getting the maximum possible speed.
 
- Download one thing at a time. If you download multiple files on different devices (for example, your computer and your game console) simultaneously, each download will be competing with the other.
 - Use an Ethernet cable or move closer to the router. If your computer has an Ethernet port, connect it directly to your modem. Circumventing the router ensures a stable connection. If that's not an option, remove any obstructions between your computer and the router, making sure they are as physically close as possible.
 - Delete temporary files. Your computer stores temporary files for programs you often use to speed up its performance, but too many temporary files can slow things down.
 - Switch web browsers. Your default browser may not be optimized for your internet connection, so try downloading the file in a different browser.
 - Turn off the metered connection. If you set a metered connection to limit data usage, disable it to maximize download speeds.
 - Turn off background apps. Applications that run in the background and use the internet can interfere with download speeds, so disable any apps that take up a lot of bandwidth and resources.
 - Use a download manager. Some download managers can download files from multiple sources simultaneously, allowing for faster download speeds.
 - Switch DNS servers. Your internet service provider (ISP) chooses your default DNS server, and it doesn't always pick the fastest one. Experiment to find out which server works best for you.
 - Disable automatic Windows updates. Windows downloads and installs the latest OS updates automatically, so turn off this feature to make sure it doesn't interfere with your other downloads.
 - Change the bandwidth limit. Windows reserves bandwidth for itself to update Microsoft apps and services. Fortunately, you can adjust the bandwidth limits in your settings to prioritize downloads.
 - Upgrade your internet plan. Your internet package limits your connection speed. Contact your ISP to discuss switching to a faster one.

 
##   Why Is My Download Speed So Slow Even Though I Have Fast Internet?  
 

Technically, download speed refers to how fast your modem receives data from the internet. This data includes streaming, so if you're watching Netflix or using other web-based services, it'll affect your downloads. Just because your internet package promises high maximum download speeds doesn't mean you automatically get the fastest speed. Check with your ISP to ensure you have the right equipment to get the internet speed for which you're paying them.

 

Download one thing at a time. If you download multiple files on different devices (for example, your computer and your game console) simultaneously, each download will be competing with the other.

 

Use an Ethernet cable or move closer to the router. If your computer has an Ethernet port, connect it directly to your modem. Circumventing the router ensures a stable connection.
