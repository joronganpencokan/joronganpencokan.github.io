Step 1: Create a bootable USB flash drive or external hard drive

To create a bootable USB flash drive or external hard drive, you first need to download a Windows 7 ISO file from the Microsoft website. After downloading the file, you can use a free software called Rufus to create a bootable USB flash drive or external hard drive.

4. Click on the "Start" button to create a bootable USB flash drive or external hard drive.

Step 2: Boot from the USB flash drive or external hard drive

Now that you have created a bootable USB flash drive or external hard drive, you need to boot your computer from it. To do this, you need to access the BIOS or UEFI settings of your computer.

To access the BIOS or UEFI settings, follow these steps:

1. Restart your computer and press the key to enter the BIOS or UEFI settings. The key may differ depending on the manufacturer of your computer, but common keys include F2, F10, or Del.
2. Once you are in the BIOS or UEFI settings, navigate to the "Boot" tab.
3. Change the boot order so that the USB flash drive or external hard drive is the first boot device.
4. Save the changes and exit the BIOS or UEFI settings.

Step 3: Install Windows 7

After you have booted your computer from the USB flash drive or external hard drive, you can now install Windows 7. The installation process is the same as if you were installing from a DVD.

To install Windows 7, follow these steps:

1. Select the language, time and currency, and keyboard input method and click "Next."
2. Click on "Install now."

However, simply copying the files from your Windows 7 DVD to a flash drive won't work. You have to specially prepare the USB device and then properly copy the Windows 7 install files to it before it'll work as you expect.

 
As of January 2020, Microsoft no longer supports Windows 7. We recommend you upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 to continue receiving security updates and technical support.

No matter what situation you're in, just follow the instructions below to install Windows 7 from a USB device.
