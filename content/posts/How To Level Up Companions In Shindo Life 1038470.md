Unveiling The Ultimate Cheat Code To Level Up Your Companions In Shindo Life- You Won't Believe How Easy It Is!

Have you been struggling to level up your companions in Shindo Life? Does it feel like you are stuck in the same spot and can't seem to make any progress? Well, worry no more because we have the ultimate cheat code that will help you level up your companions in no time! And the best part? It's incredibly easy!

Before we delve into the cheat code, let's first understand why leveling up your companions is so important in Shindo Life. Firstly, as you progress through the game, you will encounter tougher and stronger enemies that will require stronger companions to defeat. Having stronger companions can also make your overall gameplay experience much smoother and enjoyable.

So, how do we level up our companions quickly? The answer is simple: through feeding them. Yes, you read that right. Feeding your companions can significantly increase their level without much effort on your part.

To start, you will need to head to the Shindo Life map and look for food stands. Each food stand will sell specific types of food, and each type of food will give a certain amount of experience points to your companions. Simply purchase the food and bring it back to your companion to feed them.

There are various types of food available in the game, each with its respective experience value. The more expensive the food, the more experience points it will provide to your companions. However, it is essential to note that each companion has a limit to how much food they can consume, and once they hit that limit, the experience points gained from food will decrease.

Another essential factor to consider is your companion's preference for food. Just like in real life, each companion has their favorite food, and feeding them their favorite food will yield more experience points.

Feeding your companion their preferred food is not the only way to gain experience points. Completing missions, battles, and training will also gain experience for your companions. However, feeding is the most effective and fastest method to level up your companions.

In summary, leveling up your companions in Shindo Life is crucial to progress through the game and make your gameplay experience smoother. Feeding them their favorite food and completing missions, battles, and training are all viable methods to level up your companions, but feeding is the quickest and most efficient way.

So, grab your wallet and head to the food stands to start leveling up your companions today! Happy gaming!

## How to Level up Companions in Shindo Life
 

 
These are the steps to level up your companion.
 
- Equip a Companion.
 - Roam around the area you are in and look for green or orange scroll missions.
 - Once you find a mission take it up.
 - When you start a mission be sure to summon your companion any time during the mission. This will ensure that your companion participated in the mission.
 - And once you have completed the mission it will level up your character and your companion.

 
If you follow the above steps correctly you should be able to level up your companions easily.
 
A tip to remember is you can summon your companion just before you deliver the final blow or last few blows. This will increase the chances of them not dying during the mission. Also, you can only level up your companion to level 1000.
 
Another tip is to not take missions you cannot complete. It is better to not take the mission than your companion dying.
