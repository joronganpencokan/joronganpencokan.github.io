# Transform your Boring Gray Slides into Vibrant Masterpieces with This Simple PowerPoint Trick!

Are you tired of creating presentations that look dull and boring? Do you want to make your slides more engaging and visually appealing? If yes, then you are in the right place! In this article, we will share a simple PowerPoint trick that will help you transform your boring gray slides into vibrant masterpieces. 

PowerPoint is a powerful tool that can help you create beautiful presentations. However, sometimes, the default templates and themes can be a bit bland and uninspiring. To make your presentations stand out, you need to add some color, graphics, and animations. 

Here's the trick: Instead of using the default colors in your PowerPoint presentation, you can create your color scheme. This way, you can choose colors that match your branding, topic, or style. 

To create a custom color scheme, follow these steps:

1. Open your PowerPoint presentation and go to the Design tab. 

2. Select the Theme Colors dropdown menu, and then click on Customize Colors. 

3. Here, you can choose a color from the color picker or enter a specific RGB or HEX code for your desired color. 

4. Once you have selected your colors, click on the Save option under the Name field. 

5. Finally, choose a name for your color scheme and save it. Your custom color scheme will now be available for you to use in any PowerPoint presentation. 

Using this simple trick, you can create vibrant and eye-catching slides that will keep your audience engaged and interested in your presentation. However, remember to use colors and graphics wisely, as too much of anything can be overwhelming and distracting. 

In addition to creating a custom color scheme, here are some other tips to make your PowerPoint presentation visually appealing: 

- Use high-quality images and graphics that are relevant to your topic. 

- Don't clutter your slides with too much text. Keep it short and simple. 

- Use animations and transitions to make your presentation more dynamic. 

In conclusion, a little bit of color goes a long way in making your PowerPoint presentation more impactful. By using this simple trick, you can transform your boring gray slides into vibrant masterpieces that will wow your audience. So, what are you waiting for? Give it a try and watch your presentations come to life!

When you add color to part of a grayscale photo, you draw attention to that part of the image because it jumps out at you. Get this effect by starting with a full-color image and removing the color in part of the picture. You may want to use this trick for your next PowerPoint presentation. 

 
##   PowerPoint Color Effect  
 

One nice feature about PowerPoint is that you can make color changes to part of an image in just a few minutes without special photo-editing software like Photoshop. This tutorial takes you through the steps to create a picture on a slide that is a combination of color and grayscale.

 
Instructions in this article apply to PowerPoint 2019, 2016, 2013, 2010; and PowerPoint for Microsoft 365.
 

For simplicity, choose a picture that is already in landscape layout. This ensures that the whole slide is covered with no slide background color showing, although this technique also works on smaller photos.

 

Select a picture with the focus on an object that has crisp and well-defined lines as its outline. This tutorial uses an example image with a large rose as the focal point of the picture.

 
##   Import the Color Image into PowerPoint  
 
- Open a PowerPoint file and select an empty slide.
 - Go to Insert.
 - In the Images group, select Pictures.
 - Navigate to the location on your computer where you saved the picture, choose the picture, and select Open to place it on the PowerPoint slide.
 - Resize the picture if necessary to cover the whole slide.

 
##   Remove the Background of the Color Picture  
 
- Click on the color picture to select it.
 - Go to Picture Tools Format.
 - In the Adjust group, select Remove Background. The focal point of the picture remains, while the remainder of the picture on the slide turns a magenta color.
 - If you're satisfied with the results, select Keep Changes. If not all of the background was removed or if part of the image is removed, fine-tune the background.

 
##   Fine-Tune the Background Removal Process  
 

After the background (the magenta section of the picture) is removed, you may notice that some portions of the picture were not removed as you had hoped or too many parts were removed. This is easily corrected.

 

Open a PowerPoint file and select an empty slide.

 

Go to Insert.

 

In the Images group, select Pictures.

 

Navigate to the location on your computer where you saved the picture, choose the picture, and select Open to place it on the PowerPoint slide.

 

Resize the picture if necessary to cover the whole slide. 

 

Click on the color picture to select it.

 

Go to Picture Tools Format.

 

In the Adjust group, select Remove Background. The focal point of the picture remains, while the remainder of the picture on the slide turns a magenta color.

 

If you're satisfied with the results, select Keep Changes. If not all of the background was removed or if part of the image is removed, fine-tune the background.

 

To fine-tune the background, go to Background Removal and:

 
- Select Mark Areas to Keep and drag across areas of the background that you wish to keep as part of the focal point of the picture.Select Mark Areas to Remove and drag across areas of the background that you wish to remove, as they are not part of the focal point of the picture.

 

If you don't like the changes you made, select Discard All Changes and start over. Or, press Ctrl+Z to undo the last change you made. When you're happy with the result, select Keep Changes.

 
##   Import Image Again and Convert to Grayscale  
 

The next step is to stack a copy of the original color picture on top of the picture that now shows only the focal point (in this example, the focal point is the large rose).

 
- Go to Insert.
 - Select Picture and navigate to the same photo. Choose it and select Open.

 
##   Convert Picture to Grayscale  
 
- Click on the newly imported picture on the slide to select it.
 - Go to Picture Tools Format.
 - In the Adjust group, select Color.
 - In the Recolor section, select Grayscale. It's the second option in the first row of the Recolor section.
 - The tooltip Grayscale appears when you hover over the button if you are unsure. The picture is converted to grayscale.

 
##   Send Grayscale Image Behind Color Picture  
 

Now you are going to send the grayscale version of the image to the back so that it is behind the color focal point of the first image.

 

Select Picture and navigate to the same photo. Choose it and select Open. 

 
Make sure this second image is exactly the same size and shape as the first image so it can be stacked correctly on top of the first picture.
 

Click on the newly imported picture on the slide to select it.

 

In the Adjust group, select Color.

 

In the Recolor section, select Grayscale. It's the second option in the first row of the Recolor section.

 

The tooltip Grayscale appears when you hover over the button if you are unsure. The picture is converted to grayscale.

 
- Click on the grayscale picture to select it
 - Go to Picture Tools Format.
 - Select Send Backward. Or, right-click on the grayscale picture and select Send to Back > Send to Back.
 - If the photo-alignment is exact, the color focal point is perfectly positioned on top of its grayscale counterpart in the grayscale image.

 
##   Finished Image  
 

This final result appears to be a single picture with a combination of both grayscale and color. There's no doubt what the focal point of this image is.

 

Click on the grayscale picture to select it

 

Select Send Backward. Or, right-click on the grayscale picture and select Send to Back > Send to Back.

 

If the photo-alignment is exact, the color focal point is perfectly positioned on top of its grayscale counterpart in the grayscale image.
