Revive Your Online Sleuthing Game: Uncover the Secret Trick to Bring Back the Old Reverse Image Search in Chrome Now!

Have you ever come across an interesting image while browsing the web and wanted to know more about it, but didn't know how to find the source? Reverse image search is a handy tool that helps you discover the origin of an image, its copyright information, and other related images. Chrome used to have a convenient feature that made reverse image search simple and easy, but it disappeared in 2018, leaving many of us struggling to find an alternative. Luckily, there is a secret trick that can bring it back!

Before we dive into the details, let's understand what reverse image search is and how it works. Reverse image search is a technique that allows users to search for images on the web using an image instead of keywords. This is done by uploading an image file or pasting the image URL into the search engine. The engine then scans the web for the uploaded image or similar ones and provides results with useful information about it, such as where it appears, its size and resolution, and other related images.

Google offers its own reverse image search engine, which was built into Chrome until 2018. All you had to do was right-click on an image and select "Search Google for Image," and you would be taken to a search results page with information about the image. Unfortunately, Google removed this feature from Chrome due to low usage and replaced it with a less intuitive version.

But fear not! You can bring back the old reverse image search feature in Chrome with a simple trick. Here's how:

1. Open the Chrome browser and go to the menu bar on the top right corner.

2. Click on "Settings" and scroll down to "Search engine."

3. Click on "Manage search engines."

4. Scroll down to the bottom of the list of search engines until you see "Add a new search engine."

5. Fill in the following information:

- Search engine: Google Images
- Keyword: gi
- URL: https://www.google.com/searchbyimage?image_url=%s

6. Click on "Save."

And voila! You can now use the old reverse image search feature in Chrome by right-clicking on an image, selecting "Search for Image using Google Images," and you'll be taken to the search results page with all the information you need.

This simple trick can help you track down the source of an image, find similar images, and discover new information you might not have found otherwise. It's a useful tool for researchers, content creators, and anyone who wants to satisfy their curiosity about an image they come across online.

In conclusion, Chrome's old reverse image search may have been gone for a while, but with this easy trick, you can revive your online sleuthing game and bring it back. Give it a try and see how it can enhance your browsing experience. Happy searching!
