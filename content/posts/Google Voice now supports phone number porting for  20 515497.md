If you are a Google Voice user and you werenâ€™t exited about having to remember two different phone numbers (your own mobile phone number and Google Voice number), you can now simplify things for just $20 bucks. Today Google is announcing that phone number porting is now available for all existing Google Voice users. This means you can use your exiting mobile phone number, that you have used for a long time, for your Google Voice number, and if you decide to get it, there is going to be a one-time fee of $20 bucks that you have to pay via Google Checkout service.
 
## How to begin with Number Porting:
 
- Log-in to your Google Voice account.
 - Go to the Settings page and click Change/Port next to your Google Voice number.

 

 
Just remember what after you the change and you paid the $20, it can take up to about 24 hours to complete porting the mobile number to Google Voice.
 
Now, you should pay attention when porting a mobile phone number to Google Voice service, because after the switch your existing mobile phone subscription will be cancelled, and you might have to pay early termination fee to you mobile service provider. As you know Google Voice is not a mobile service provider, and you will need a mobile service plan with another mobile phone number, to be able to use Google Voice service with your mobile phone.
 
Another thing to keep in mind is that you might experience some difficulties when texting in the first 3 days after porting, because your mobile service has to be restarted.
 
This is a YouTube video that briefly explains how all this process works:
 
As I mentioned above the services is now available for current Google Voice users, but in a few weeks it will become an option for every new user.
