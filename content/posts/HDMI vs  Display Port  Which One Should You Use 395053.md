# Are You Using the WRONG Cable? HDMI vs Display Port Battle - You Won't Believe What You're Missing Out On!

Are you tired of dealing with lagging screens or subpar visuals on your computer or TV? The answer to your problems might just lie in the cable you're using to connect your device to the display. In recent years, the age-old battle of HDMI vs Display Port (DP) has re-emerged with a vengeance. So, which cable should you be using and what exactly are you missing out on?

## HDMI vs Display Port: The Never-Ending Debate

HDMI and DP both have their merits, but their differences in capabilities may sway some users in favor of one over the other. HDMI is the industry-standard for most home entertainment devices and offers full support for high-definition (HD) video and audio. However, the latest HDMI 2.1 specification only supports 4k video at 60 frames per second (fps) - which may not be enough for some gamers or those with high-end displays.

On the other hand, DP was developed specifically with computers in mind and offers higher bandwidth and longer cable lengths than HDMI. DP has traditionally been the superior option for gamers, allowing for higher refresh rates and resolutions, and often supports technologies such as FreeSync and G-Sync, which can eliminate screen tearing and stuttering during gameplay.

## So What Are You Missing Out On?

If you're using the wrong cable, you could be missing out on a whole host of advancements, depending on your requirements. For example, gamers who use a high-end monitor for competitive play are likely to benefit from the advantages of DP. Higher refresh rates mean smoother gameplay, and the lack of screen tearing or stuttering can give a competitive edge in fast-paced games.

Similarly, if you're using a 4k TV or monitor and want to utilize the maximum resolution and fps, HDMI 2.1 is the way to go. This cable specification offers support for 4k at 120fps, which is rare in even the highest-spec DP cables. Additionally, HDMI cords reach a maximum length of around 50 feet before signal degradation, while DP can support cables of up to 100 feet without any issues.

## Making the Right Choice

So, which cable should you choose? Ultimately, it depends on your needs and constraints. If you're looking to connect to a home entertainment system, HDMI is likely to meet your needs without struggles. However, for those who prioritize gaming, DP may give you the edge you need. Many new monitors now offer both HDMI and DP connections, and if this is an option, going for a combination of both may be the best choice. 

In conclusion, the battle between HDMI and Display Port will continue, as it's essential to keep in mind the advantages and disadvantages of both cables to make the best choice for your specific situations. Understanding the features, bandwidth, and specifications will not only help in making the right decision but also enhance the experience while enjoying high-quality visuals on a screen.

One of the factors to consider when selecting a monitor is the ports it provides for you to plug into. Among the different ports are the HDMI and Display Port, which look remarkably similar but have different capabilities and compatibility.
 
If you’re wondering what the difference between the two ports is and which one you should use, follow along to learn more as we explain everything you need to know.
 
## What Is a Display Port?
 
Display Port specification was developed and introduced by VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) in 2006 to replace the VGA and DVI standard used primarily for computer displays.
 
It’s capable of carrying video and audio signals. You can find Display Ports on devices such as computers, PC monitors, some mobile devices, televisions, and in some projectors.
 
## What Is HDMI?
 
HDMI or High-Definition Multimedia Interface was introduced by HDMI Licensing in 2003 and is mostly found in consumer electronics, as it can pass audio, video and some control signals.
 
Some of the devices with HDMI include Blu-ray, DVD, Ultra-HD players, televisions and video projectors, home theater receivers, DVRs and cable or satellite boxes, gaming consoles, consumer computers, digital cameras, camcorders, media streamers and some smartphones.
 
## HDMI vs. Display Port: Which One Should You Use?
 
Both HDMI and Display Port have different versions that support different standards. Even if your computer supports both outputs, it is best to find out which version of each standard your computer supports.
 
Display Port comes in five versions: 1.0 – 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 2.0.
 
- DisplayPort 1.0 – 1.1: Supports up to 4K at 30Hz and transfer speeds up to 8.64Gbps.DisplayPort 1.2: Supports up to 4K at 60Hz and transfer speeds up to 17.28Gbps. Some 1.2a ports may also support AMD’s FreeSync.DisplayPort 1.3: Supports up to 4K at 120Hz or 8K at 30Hz and transfer speeds up to 25.92Gbps.DisplayPort 1.4: Supports up to 8K at 60Hz and HDR.

 
On the other hand, HDMI comes with version 1.4, 2.0 and the latest 2.1.
 
- HDMI 1.4: Supports up to 4K at 30Hz or 1080p at 120Hz.HDMI 2.0: Supports up to 4K at 60Hz and includes support for HDRHDMI 2.1: Supports up to 10K resolution at 120Hz, as well as improved HDR and enhanced Audio Return Channel (eARC).

 
Depending on the version of the port your computer supports, you can decide which one will give you a better result.
 
For Apple users, the standard Display Port also works with Thunderbolt, although devices with Thunderbolt won’t work with it. Consequently, if you try to connect a DisplayPort-enabled device and a Thunderbolt-enabled monitor, it’ll work, but the opposite won’t work.
 
## Nvidia or AMD Graphic Card
 
If you are planning to use Nvidia G-Sync, then Display Port is the one yu should choosr. Display Port is the only one supporting G-Sync for now. Both Display Port and HDMI support AMD’s Freesync technology, though.
 
## Do You Need to Connect Multiple Monitors?
 
If you need to connect multiple monitors to your computer, you can either make use of the two ports to connect various monitors or daisy chain Display Port to multiple monitors. If you have at least Display Port version 1.2 and Multi-Stream, you can use it with very high-resolution monitors.
 
## What Is the Connecting Output?
 
HDMI is able to send sound from the display to the source because it supports Audio Return Channel (ARC). This is helpful when you’re using a smart TV. HDMI is good for connecting gaming consoles, streaming devices or Blu-ray players to your TV, while Display Port is great for connecting a computer to a monitor and for running multiple motors from one cable using hubs or displays with daisy chaining support.
 
Display Port is primarily used for peripheral video and computer connections, while HDMI is mainly for consumer electronics equipment.
 
Both HDMI and Display Port only make a difference if you have a high-resolution display. For your regular non-4K monitor, if you are not into gaming, it doesn’t really matter which one you use.
 
Also check out other display standards and the usage scenarios where you’ll be using their respective connectors.
