Disney's Secret Recipe: Learn how to make Decadent Pastry Cream and Fruits in Dreamlight Valley - You Won't Believe the Results!

When it comes to theme park desserts, Disney never fails to amaze us with its sweet treats that make our hearts sing. From Mickey Mouse-shaped donuts to Dole Whip soft-serve, Disney's menu of park-exclusive desserts is what dreams are made of. But there's one dish that stands out among the rest - the Pastry Cream and Fruits from Dreamlight Valley. 

If you've never had the pleasure of trying it, Pastry Cream and Fruits is essentially a decadent, creamy pie filling made with eggs, sugar, and milk, paired with a mix of fresh seasonal fruits. It's a heavenly dessert that packs a punch, and the good news is, you can make it yourself! Here's how to whip up the recipe for Disney's Secret Pastry Cream and Fruits.

Ingredients

- 1 cup whole milk
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 4 large egg yolks
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract 
- a mix of seasonal fruits (we recommend strawberries, blueberries, and kiwis)

Instructions

1. In a saucepan, bring the milk, heavy cream and salt to a simmer over medium heat - this is to make sure the milk is really hot when you need to temper the eggs into it later.

2. Meanwhile, in a medium heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks together with the cornstarch and sugar until the mixture lightens and becomes a pale yellow.

3. Whisking the egg mixture constantly, slowly pour in about 1/3 of the hot milk mixture - this is to temper the eggs without cooking them. Gradually whisk in the remaining milk mixture while pouring it through a fine-mesh sieve back into the saucepan - this helps to remove any lumps or egg bits.

4. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly until the mixture thickens and resembles pudding. 

5. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Pour the pastry cream mixture into a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap, making sure to press it against the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate the pastry cream until completely chilled, at least 2 hours or overnight.

6. Once the pastry cream has chilled, wash and prepare your seasonal fruits. Cut them into bite-sized pieces and set them aside.

7. To assemble the Pastry Cream and Fruits dessert, spoon the chilled pastry cream into a clear glass or bowl. Add a layer of your mixed fruits, then repeat until you reach the top of the glass. 

8. Garnish with any extra fresh fruits, mint leaves or edible flowers, and serve chilled.
