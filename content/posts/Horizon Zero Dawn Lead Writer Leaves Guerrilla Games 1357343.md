Title: SHOCKING: Horizon Zero Dawn Losing Key Figure Amidst Sequel Rumors!

Introduction:
Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the most successful games of the decade, and its sequel has been on the rumor mills for a while. Fans of the game have been desperately waiting for any news on the anticipated sequel but were hit with some disappointing news recently. The video game industry was shaken by the latest development as Horizon Zero Dawn loses a significant figure amidst sequel rumors.

Body:
Hermen Hulst, co-founder of Guerrilla Games and the managing director of PlayStation Worldwide Studios, has left his position to take up another role within Sony. Hermen Hulst played a crucial role in making games like Horizon Zero Dawn and Killzone a reality for the PlayStation console.

Hulst has been instrumental in the gaming industry, and his departure from Guerrilla Games and PlayStation Worldwide Studios has shocked gamers worldwide. The rumor mill is now working overtime, as many are speculating that the departure of Hulst could have a significant impact on the development of Horizon Zero Dawn's sequel.

Horizon Zero Dawn became a critical and commercial success upon its release in 2017, and its sequel was confirmed by Guerrilla Games in 2019. The second installment is highly anticipated and has been the talk of the gaming industry since the announcement.

With Hulst's departure, concerns have been raised about the future of Horizon Zero Dawn's sequel. The industry is a highly competitive one, and when a key player like Hermen Hulst leaves a company, it raises more than a few eyebrows.

Fans of the game are worried that the sequel may not live up to expectations if the development team changes. It is not uncommon for game sequels to suffer when key players leave the development team.

Conclusion:
When a key figure like Hermen Hulst leaves a company, it is natural to worry about the future of the upcoming games, especially when they are highly anticipated sequels. Guerrilla Games and PlayStation need to reassure fans of the series that the departure of Hulst will not derail the development of the sequel.

Horizon Zero Dawn was a masterpiece, and it is safe to say that everyone hypes the second installment. We are hoping that the game developers have contingency plans in place to ensure that the departure of Hulst does not affect game development. With stunning graphics & the beautiful portrayal of human and robot encounters, we want more of Horizon Zero Dawn's breath-taking storytelling.

It's always a reality that in gaming, games can't always meet expectations, or issues may arise. The departure of Hermen Hulst is a significant event in the history of the Horizon Zero Dawn franchise. We hope that the developer can keep the sequel on track so that fans can once again enjoy the breathtaking world of Horizon Zero Dawn.

As can be seen from the LinkedIn profile of John Gonzalez, the lead writer behind Horizon: Zero Dawn decided to leave Guerrilla Games. Gonzalez is now working at a new studio for an AAA-Title in Spain.
 
Among the games that were confirmed as part of the major online event for the PlayStation 5 of Sony Interactive Entertainment was the action role-playing game Horizon: Forbidden West. Just like its predecessor, the new adventure of Aloy is being created at Guerrilla Games in the Netherlands.
 
As can be seen in the life of John Gonzalez, Guerrilla Games will have to do without his support in the future. So Gonzalez decided to leave the Dutch studio and hire a new Triple-A studio in Spain.
 
The name of the studio has not yet been revealed. If we exclude the fact that Gonzalez is working on an open-world title based on a new brand in Spain, concrete details of his next title are still to be expected. Between September 2013 and July 2016, Gonzalez worked at Guerrilla Games as lead writer on Horizon: Zero Dawn.
 
Between July 2016 and June 2020, he also worked as Narrative Director on Horizon: Forbidden West and, according to his resume, he was responsible for the plot of the successor as well as the main quests and the main characters.
 
Horizon: Forbidden West is under development exclusively for the PlayStation 5 and will release in the coming year.
