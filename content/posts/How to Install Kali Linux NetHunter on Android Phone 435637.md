If you're into hacking or interested in testing the security of your Android device, installing the Kali Linux Nethunter on your Android phone is definitely worth doing. The Kali Linux Nethunter is a powerful Android hacking suite that provides you with a full arsenal of tools to help you test security vulnerabilities and identify potential threats. In this article, we'll walk you through the easy steps to install Kali Linux Nethunter on your Android phone, so you can beef up your hacking skills and become a pro in no time!

Before we dive in, it's important to note that installing the Kali Linux Nethunter on your Android phone requires some technical skills, so if you're not experienced in rooting and flashing ROMs, it's best to follow the steps carefully to avoid bricking your phone.

Step 1: Root Your Android Phone

The first thing you need to do is to root your Android phone. Rooting your phone gives you the necessary permissions to modify system files and install custom recoveries or ROMs. You can use popular rooting apps like Kingroot or SuperSU to root your Android phone easily.

Step 2: Install TWRP Recovery

Next, you need to install the TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project) custom recovery on your Android phone. TWRP is a custom recovery that allows you to flash third-party ROMs or ZIP files, make backups, or wipe data on your Android device. You can download the TWRP recovery image from the official TWRP website and follow the installation instructions for your specific device model.

Step 3: Download Kali Linux Nethunter ZIP File

The next step is to download the Kali Linux Nethunter ZIP file for your Android phone. You can find the latest version of Kali Linux Nethunter on the official offensive security website. Make sure you download the correct file for your device's architecture (arm64, armhf, or x86).

Step 4: Flash Kali Linux Nethunter ZIP File

Once you've downloaded the Kali Linux Nethunter ZIP file, you need to flash it using the TWRP custom recovery. To do this, boot your Android phone into TWRP recovery mode, select the Install button, and navigate to the Kali Linux Nethunter ZIP file you downloaded earlier. Swipe the slider to install and wait for the process to complete. Once finished, reboot your phone.

Step 5: Install Kali Linux Nethunter App

After rebooting your phone, you can now install the Kali Linux Nethunter app, which provides you with a user-friendly interface to access all of the Kali Linux Nethunter tools. You can download the Kali Linux Nethunter app from the official offensive security website or from the Google Play Store.

Step 6: Start Hacking Like a Pro!

Congratulations! You have now successfully installed Kali Linux Nethunter on your Android phone and have access to a wide range of powerful hacking tools. You can start hacking by launching the Kali Linux Nethunter app and selecting your desired tool from the menu.

In conclusion, installing Kali Linux Nethunter on your Android phone is a great way to revolutionize your Android device and take your hacking skills to the next level. Although the installation process may seem daunting at first, following the steps carefully will ensure a successful install and an incredible hacking experience. Happy hacking!

Kali Linux is the most popular penetration testing and security auditing operating system in the world. Thanks to the NetHunter project, it is now possible to install Kali Linux on an Android phone.
 
NetHunter is the mobile version of Kali Linux and designed for Android devices. It’s a powerful tool for penetration testing. This tutorial shows how to install NetHunter on any unrooted Android phone.
 
If you are interested in penetration testing, you should also check out these additional penetration tools for Android, and desktop.
 
## What Is Kali Linux NetHunter?
 
Kali Linux NetHunter is the mobile version of the popular Kali Linux security operating system. You can install it on any unrooted Android phone to run many penetration testing tools from your phone. 
 
Kali NetHunter is available in three versions:
 
- NetHunter Rootless for unrooted Android phones
 - NetHunter for rooted phones with custom recovery with a NetHunter-specific kernel
 - NetHunter Lite for phones with custom recovery

 
The NetHunter suite, for all three versions, is made up of the following:
 
- NetHunter App Store with hundreds of security applications
 - Kali Linux container that includes all the apps available in Kali Linux
 - Android app to access the NetHunter App Store
 - NetHunter KeX (Desktop Experience) to run Kali desktop sessions. NetHunter KeX includes support for screencasting and mirroring.

 
## Steps to Install Kali Linux NetHunter on Android
 
The only requirement for installing Kali Linux Nethunter is that the phone is running Android 7 or newer. We recommend an Android version before 12, as the latter monitors and kills the processes of apps when they consume too much processing power.
 
## 1. Install Termux on Your Phone
 
- While you can get the Termux app from Google Play Store, the variant is deprecated: it doesn’t receive updates and contains bugs and outdated repositories. We recommend that you install the latest version from its GitHub page.

 
Download the app by clicking on the option highlighted above. The download should take a few seconds, based on your Internet speed. Tap on the downloaded file to install it.
 
- By default, your phone does not allow you to install apps from unknown sources. In that case, you have to set up the permissions by tapping “Settings.”

 
- Your phone will redirect you to a settings page where you can opt to allow app installs from your browser, as shown:

 
- You’ll reach the Install option that will allow you to install the app.

 
## 2. Upgrade Repositories
 
Once the Termux app is installed, you should update the repositories. Debian Linux and most of its derived versions use APT (Advanced Package Tool) to install the software. Refer to this ultimate guide to apt and apt-get commands for your reference.
 
By running the update command, we retrieve package source information from the configured resources. The upgrade command will use the information to upgrade all packages to the latest versions.
 
You can also learn basic Linux commands to make better use of Termux.
 
First, run the update command:
 
Enter the following command:
 
When asked “Do you want to continue?” press Y and Enter.
 
Next, set up the storage permissions for the Termux app by using this command:
 
It should trigger a pop-up that asks whether you want to allow Termux to access files on your device. Tap on “Allow.”
 
## 3. Install NetHunter
 
- Install Wget by running this command:

 
When asked, “Do you want to continue?” reply with Y.
 
- Download the NetHunter installation file by running the command below. Ensure that you enter the address correctly.

 
- Adjust the file permissions of the downloaded file, making it executable:

 
- Execute NetHunter:

 
The installation may take some time, depending on your Internet connection speed. 
 
- When asked whether you want to delete the downloaded rootfs file, reply with N, as you may need it later.

 
## 4. Start Kali NetHunter
 
To start the Kali Linux NetHunter Command Line Interface, type in this command:
 
You can also use the nh command as a shortcut for NetHunter.
 
The next step is to set the NetHunter KeX password. Note that you have to exit the NetHunter CLI to run this command:
 
Start NetHunter KeX by running this command:
 
Please take note of the RFB Port number, as you will use it later.
 
At this point, NetHunter is up and running, but you have to configure displays to use the software.
 
## 5. Install NetHunter KeX
 
NetHunter KeX is the App Store for NetHunter. This app store contains different tools that you may not get on your regular app store. Don’t confuse it with Samsung Dex.
 
- Visit the NetHunter App Store website.
 - Download and install the NetHunter store app.

 
- Launch the app store, search for NetHunter KeX and install it.

 
- After the NetHunter Store app downloads the NetHunter KeX app, you will be asked whether you wish to install it. Tap “Install.”

 
- Launch NetHunter KeX. The app requires you to enter the KeX username and password. The user name is optional; in our case, we will not need it. Enter the password you set earlier and ensure that the port number is similar to what you had when you configured NetHunter KeX, then click “Connect.”

 
- If you followed all the steps correctly, you should have Kali NetHunter GUI running on your Android phone.

 
## Using Kali Linux Nethunter on Android
 
For your comfort, you can choose any input mode: Direct Swipe Pan, Direct Hold Pan, Single Hand, and Simulated Touchpad. The Direct Swipe Pan mode enables you to control the mouse directly by touching it. When you tap, the mouse clicks where you tapped.
 
To use Direct Hold Pan mode, long tap to start pan mode. Tapping makes the mouse click where you tapped. The Simulated Touchpad mode converts your screen into a simulated touchpad. Lastly, the Single Hand mode works similar to the Direct and Swap Pan modes, except long tapping opens a menu with a list of options.
 
Alternatively, if you want to access your Android phone from Kali Linux (on a desktop), learn how in this tutorial.

### What phones are compatible with Kali NetHunter?
 
NetHunter Rootless is compatible with most Android phones. The Termux App, which serves as the container for NetHunter, requires Android 7 or later. However, devices running on Android 12 may not work, as it often kills the processes of apps when they consume too much processing power.
 
### Will Kali NetHunter on my phone break the Android operating system?
 
Installing the Kali NetHunter Rootless does not replace your phone’s operating system. It runs just like any other app on your phone. In addition, you will not need to reinstall the operating system when uninstalling Kali NetHunter. You can also update your phone without any issues.
