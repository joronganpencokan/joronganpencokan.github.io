# You Won't Believe This Simple Trick To Live Stream World Cup Soccer – Watch From Anywhere!

The World Cup, the most prestigious event for soccer enthusiasts, is finally here! With the kickoff, soccer lovers worldwide are already gearing up for the upcoming matches. However, with many countries participating, keeping up with the games can be a real challenge, especially for those who don't have access to the broadcasting channels.

But, don't worry! You can live stream the soccer World Cup games, regardless of where you are. This article will show you how to take advantage of an incredible trick to watch the games from anywhere, anytime.

## Get a VPN

A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is an online tool designed to provide a secure internet connection and allow users to access restricted websites and content. VPNs act like a virtual tunnel that encrypts your online traffic and protects your data from unauthorized access. But, most importantly, for you soccer fans, VPNs can help you watch the World Cup live streams from anywhere.

## How does a VPN help?

One of the major benefits of using a VPN for live streaming is that it changes your IP address. Once you connect to a VPN server, it assigns you a new IP address from a different location. This feature allows you to bypass the geo-restrictions imposed by broadcasting channels to access content that is otherwise inaccessible in your region.

Thus, if you reside outside a region where the broadcasting channel has the rights to stream World Cup matches, you can connect to a VPN server in a location that has access. That way, you can access the live stream and watch the matches without restrictions.

Moreover, since VPNs encrypt your online traffic, your ISP won't be able to throttle your internet speed, which is a common problem during peak streaming hours. Besides, you will be protected against hackers, malware, and phishing attacks that may occur while you watch the games.

 ## Steps to Follow

Now, let's see how you can use a VPN to watch the soccer World Cup live.

1. Firstly, select a reliable VPN service that provides fast streaming and has servers in regions that are streaming World Cup matches.

2. Download and install the VPN application on your device.

3. Connect to a VPN server in a region where the broadcasting channel has access to streaming the World Cup matches.

4. Once you have established the connection, go to the broadcasting channel's website or mobile application and access the live stream.

5. Sit back, relax, and enjoy watching the World Cup, no matter where you are!

## Conclusion

The soccer World Cup is an event that unites soccer enthusiasts worldwide. Thanks to VPNs, you can keep up with the matches, regardless of the broadcasting restrictions in your region. Therefore, don't miss the excitement – get a VPN, and watch the games from anywhere!

The FIFA World Cup is one of the biggest events in the sporting world, dwarfing most other competitions with its massive size and scope.

 
##   Broadcast Rights Overview  
 

The World Cup pits the 32 best soccer, or association football, teams against each other in exciting competitions.

 
### 
The 2022 FIFA World Cup
 
World Cup Finals: November 21, 2022Location: QatarStream: FOX Sports GO
 
### 
The 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup
 
Finals: July 10, 2023Location: Australia and New ZealandStream: FOX Sports GO
 

FOX owns the English-language broadcast rights in the United States for the World Cup, and NBCUniversal’s Telemundo Media owns the Spanish-language rights. That means cable and satellite subscribers can live stream the World Cup Finals through the official FOX Sports website, or through the NBC Sports website for the Spanish-language broadcast.

 

Everyone else can live stream the World Cup Finals through online streaming services like YouTubeTV and fuboTV. For the 2022 and 2023 qualifying rounds, streaming services like fuboTV are a great option.

 

To live stream World Cup soccer through FOX Sports GO or a streaming service, all you need is a high-speed internet connection, a device like a smartphone or a laptop, and the right television streaming app.

 
##   How to Live Stream World Cup Soccer From FOX  
 

Cable and satellite television subscribers have the option to watch the World Cup Finals on FOX and FS1. But the tournament phase of the World Cup is a massive event, involving 32 teams, packed into fewer than 30 calendar days. Do you really want to spend all that time stuck in front of your television?

 

FOX Sports GO is an online streaming service that's free if you have a qualifying cable or satellite subscription, and you can use it to live stream the World Cup Finals on your computer, phone, tablet, or game console. The only requirements are a high-speed internet connection and a cable subscription that includes FOX and FS1.

 

The FOX Sports GO website works on Windows, macOS, and Linux computers and laptops, as long as you use a web browser like Chrome or Firefox that supports streaming. You don't need to download an app, because you can watch the live stream right on the website.

 
- Navigate to the FOXSportsGO.com website when the World Cup is on the air. Locate the card labeled World Cup, and click it.
 - Click TV PROVIDER SIGN IN.
 - You don't need to sign in with a FOX Sports GO account or social media account, all you have to do is sign in with your TV provider.
 - Select your cable or satellite provider.
 - Log into your cable or satellite account and click Sign In, Log in, or Continue.
 - The login page you see will vary depending on your provider, but you will always have to enter your cable or satellite account email and password to log in.
 - If the World Cup live stream video doesn't automatically open, return to FOXSportsGO.com and click the World Cup card again.

 
##   Which Streaming Services Have the World Cup Live Stream?  
 

Cord cutters can't use FOX Sports GO, but that doesn't mean they're totally cut off from live streaming World Cup soccer. Instead of using a cable or satellite subscription, cord cutters can watch all of the same action through any television streaming service that includes both FOX and FS1.

 

Navigate to the FOXSportsGO.com website when the World Cup is on the air. Locate the card labeled World Cup, and click it.

 

Click TV PROVIDER SIGN IN.

 
You don't need to sign in with a FOX Sports GO account or social media account, all you have to do is sign in with your TV provider.
 

Select your cable or satellite provider.

 

Log into your cable or satellite account and click Sign In, Log in, or Continue.

 
The login page you see will vary depending on your provider, but you will always have to enter your cable or satellite account email and password to log in.

Live television streaming services allow you to watch the same live television channels that are normally only available through a cable or satellite subscription. In many cases, these services are also able to provide live streams for local network channels like FOX.

 

Instead of watching through a cable connection or satellite dish, these services allow you to stream the live video over a high speed internet connection. These services tend to offer more options, and cost less, than traditional cable television. They also have other benefits, like free trials and no long-term contract commitments.

 

Since the entirety of the World Cup Soccer Finals are broadcast on FOX and FS1, it's important to locate a streaming service that carries both channels. A lot of streaming services include both FOX and FS1, but the availability of FOX is based on your geographic area, and some services provide wider coverage than others.

 

These are the most popular streaming services that give you access to the World Cup Finals live stream:

 
While FOX has the rights to the World Cup Finals, the World Cup Qualifiers will be broadcast on a variety of sources, including ESPN and beIN Sports. Some matches will even be broadcast on the ESPN+ subscription service, so it's impossible to get 100 percent coverage from a single streaming service for the entire three year schedule of the World Cup Qualifiers.
 
- YouTube TV: This service includes both FOX and FS1. FOX is available in most markets.
 - Hulu with Live TV: This service gives access to FOX and FS1, and they provide FOX in most markets.

 
- Sling TV: FOX and FS1 are both included with the Sling Blue plan. This is a decent option, but Sling TV only offers FOX in a limited number of markets.
 - PlayStation Vue: FOX and FS1 are both included with the least expensive package, but this is still a more expensive option than Sling TV, YouTube TV or Hulu with Live TV. There are also some major markets where Vue doesn't provide FOX.
 - fuboTV: This service includes both FOX and FS1 for about the same price as Vue. It's also focused on sports channels, and it includes a lot of international association football games. If you want decent coverage throughout the World Cup qualifying rounds, this is a good option.

 
- DirecTV Now: FOX and FS1 are both included in every plan, but this is an even more expensive option than Vue.
 - ESPN+: This streaming service is distinct from ESPN and includes coverage that isn't available on any ESPN channel. Some World Cup qualifier live streams are only available on this service, so keep that in mind in case this service ends up having the rights to matches that involve your favorite team.

 
##   Watching World Cup Soccer Live Streams on Mobile, Streaming Device and Consoles  
 

The FOX Sports GO website is primarily designed to work on laptop and desktop computers. You can use it to live stream the World Cup on your Windows, macOS, or Linux computer, but it may not work on your mobile device.

 
All of these services provide some type of free trial, so pick your favorite and you can start live streaming World Cup soccer for free.
 

If you want to watch the World Cup live stream on your phone, tablet, or a streaming device like Roku or Apple TV, you need to download the FOX Sports GO app on your device.

 

Here are the apps you'll need to watch the World Cup live stream through Fox:

 
This option only works for cable and satellite television subscribers. The FOX Sports GO app only allows you to stream live events like the World Cup Finals if you are able to provide valid login information for a qualifying cable or satellite television subscription. In some cases, you can also use the login information from a streaming service. If that doesn't work, each streaming service listed in the previous section has its own mobile app.
