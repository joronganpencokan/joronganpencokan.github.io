# Unlock the Secret to Master Villagers in Minecraft and Dominate Your Game!

Are you tired of struggling to master your Minecraft game? Look no further, because mastering villagers is the secret to succeeding in this game.

Villagers are non-player characters in Minecraft that can be found in villages. They are essential for trading, farming, and getting valuable resources. If you master the art of interacting with villagers, you will have an advantage over other players.

Here are some tips to help you unlock the secret to mastering villagers in Minecraft:

## Understand Villager Professions

Villagers come in different professions, such as farmers, librarians, blacksmiths, etc. Each profession is important and has its own unique trades. Understanding these professions will help you get the resources you need.

## Trade Wisely

Villagers offer trade options that can vary from emeralds to valuable resources. Knowing which trades to pursue will help you get the best deals and resources. You should also prioritize trading with master-level villagers as they offer better trades.

## Protect Villagers

Protecting villagers is crucial as they are vulnerable to zombie attacks. Zombies can turn villagers into zombie villagers, which can be more challenging to trade with. Protecting your villagers will ensure they stay alive and continue to trade with you.

## Breed Villagers

Breeding villagers is a great way to increase your village's population. A larger population means more available trades and resources. However, breeding villagers can only be done when there are enough beds for new villagers to occupy.

## Build a Trading Center

Building a trading center for your villagers is crucial to ensure easy access to trades. A trading center should contain various workstations for different professions, beds for breeding, and a secure perimeter to protect your villagers.

## Conclusion

Mastering villagers in Minecraft can take some time, but it is worth it. You can benefit from better trades, resources, and an overall advantage over other players. Following these tips will help you unlock the secret to mastering villagers in Minecraft and dominate your game!

Although Minecraft involves creating a world through blocks, there are a plethora of other things you can invest your time in. This includes brewing different food recipes, fighting mobs, and trading with villagers or wandering traders. Speaking of trading, it is one of the most important mechanics in the game as it is the easiest way to obtain items. These villagers and traders have different trading levels that increase upon each trade. But is there a way to increase their level to master level? Yes! So, here’s our guide on how to level up villagers to master level in Minecraft.
 
## How to Level up Villagers to Master Level in Minecraft?
 
As mentioned each of these villagers has an XP level that increases as you trade with them. There are five levels for each of the villagers. You can see their levels with their badges on the trading menu. Mentioned below are all the levels of the villagers:
 
- Novice: Start (0-9 XP)
 - Apprentice: Above 10 XP
 - Journeyman: Above 70 XP
 - Expert: Above 150 XP
 - Master: Above 250 XP

 
So, the more you trade with the villages, the more XP they gain. That means the fastest way to level up the villagers to master level is to trade with them as much as possible. In addition to that, these villagers also have an assigned profession. These professions are assigned according to their job-site blocks. Librarians and Stonemasons are the best villagers to obtain some quick emeralds. As you level up them, you receive popularity points. These popularity points are scaled in the range of -30 to +30 points. If you have high popularity points, the trade prices will decrease.
