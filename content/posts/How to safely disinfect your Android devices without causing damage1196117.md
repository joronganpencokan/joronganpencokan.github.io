# Before It's Too Late: Protect Your Android Devices from Harmful Germs with These Easy Disinfecting Hacks!

Our Android devices have become an inseparable part of our lives. We use them to make calls, send messages, browse the internet, and check our emails. However, did you know that your phone collects more germs and bacteria than a public restroom? Yes, you heard it right!

Research shows that our phones could have up to 10 times more bacteria than a public restroom. Considering the current pandemic situation, it is crucial to keep our devices clean and germ-free to prevent the spread of infections. Here are some easy disinfecting hacks that can help you protect your Android devices from harmful germs:

## Start with the basics

The first and most simple step is to clean your phone with a microfiber cloth. Most smartphones come with a microfiber cloth that you can use to clear away dirt, dust, and fingerprints from the screen. Also, avoid using harsh chemicals, such as cleaners that contain ammonia, bleach, or vinegar. Instead, use a mild soap solution and wipe your device with a clean, damp cloth.

## Use UV light disinfection

UV light is a powerful disinfectant that can kill bacteria, viruses, and other harmful germs. You can purchase a UV-C light sanitizer, specially designed for smartphones, that uses UV rays to kill germs on the surface of your phone. Simply place your phone inside the sanitizer and let the UV light kill the germs in just a few minutes.

## Use alcohol wipes

Alcohol wipes are another effective way to disinfect your Android devices. You can use them to wipe the screen, buttons, and other parts of your phone. However, make sure to use wipes that contain at least 70% alcohol to ensure maximum effectiveness. Also, avoid using them on leather cases or covers as they can cause discoloration or damage.

## Consider a phone case with antimicrobial protection

Another way to protect your Android devices from harmful germs is to use a phone case with antimicrobial protection. These cases are specially designed with a layer of antimicrobial protection that inhibits the growth of bacteria, viruses, and other harmful microbes on the surface of your phone. You can find these cases online or in your local phone accessory store.

## Be consistent

Lastly, make sure to disinfect your Android devices regularly. Ideally, you should clean your phone at least once a day, especially if you use it frequently or use it in public places. Also, avoid sharing your phone with others or placing it on dirty surfaces.

In conclusion, keeping our Android devices clean and germ-free is essential to maintain our health and well-being, especially in these trying times. By following these easy disinfecting hacks, you can protect yourself and your loved ones from harmful germs and bacteria while using your phone. Remember, it's never too late to start taking care of your devices, so start today!
