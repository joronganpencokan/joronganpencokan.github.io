Are you tired of constantly sifting through your inbox to separate legitimate emails from pesky spam messages? Are you a victim of unwanted solicitations and unsolicited messages that keep filling up your mailbox?

If your answer is yes, then we have great news for you! The iOS Mail app has a hidden feature that can help you keep your inbox clean and spam-free. And the best part? It's incredibly easy to set up and use.

The secret is in the "Mark as Junk" option. This option allows you to mark any messages as spam, which automatically sends them to your junk folder. But what if we told you that you could take this feature to the next level and train your iPhone to recognize and filter out spam messages automatically?

Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Open the Mail app on your iPhone or iPad.

Step 2: Locate an email from a sender you want to mark as spam.

Step 3: Swipe left on the email message and tap "More."

Step 4: Tap on the "Mark" button and select "Mark as junk."

Step 5: A pop-up menu will appear asking if you want to move all future messages from this sender to the "Junk" folder. Tap "Yes."

Step 6: Repeat this process for any senders that you consider spam.

By doing this, you are actively training your iOS device to recognize this type of message as spam and automatically filter it out for you in the future. The more you use this feature, the smarter your device will become in identifying these unwanted messages.

But what if you accidentally marked a legitimate message as junk? Not to worry – you can easily retrieve it by going to the "Junk" folder, tapping on the message, and selecting "Not Junk."

In conclusion, keeping your inbox spam-free has never been easier than with this simple iOS Mail hack. Take control of your mailbox and say goodbye to unwanted spam messages once and for all. Try it out for yourself and see how much time and frustration you can save.

##   Mark Emails as Junk on an iPhone  
 

There are a few ways to move an email to the Junk folder on your phone. The method you choose depends on where you are in the Mail app or how many emails you want to send to spam at one time.

 
###   Mark Emails from an Open Email  
 

In an open email message, choose the Folder icon, then choose Junk. The message moves to the Junk folder.

 
###   Mark Several Emails from Inbox or Folder  
 

In the list of emails, tap Edit, select the emails to mark as spam, then choose either Mark > Move to Junk or Move > Junk.

 
###   Mark Individual Messages from Inbox or Folder  
 

In the list of emails, swipe left on the junk email, then tap either More > Mark > Move to Junk or More > Move Message > Junk.

 
##   What Happens When an Email Is Moved to Spam  
 

iOS Mail can only move a spam email to the Junk folder if it knows about the spam folder for the email account. If the Junk folder doesn't exist on the email server, Mail creates it. The Mail app can identify the spam folder from email services such as iCloud Mail, Gmail, Outlook Mail, Yahoo Mail, AOL, Zoho Mail, and Yandex Mail.

 

The effect of moving messages from the Inbox folder (or another location) to the Junk folder depends on how the email service interprets the action. Most email services treat messages that are moved to the Junk folder as a signal to update their spam filter to identify similar messages in the future.

 
The iOS Mail app doesn't come with spam filtering. Instead, it relies on the mail provider to filter spam appropriately.
