# Revolutionary Horizon Zero Dawn PC Patch 1.03 Drops – Get Ready for Game-Changing Crash Fixes and More!

Horizon Zero Dawn has been a well-received video game on the PlayStation 4, and when it finally became available on PC in August, it was greeted with enthusiasm from gamers. However, launch day was plagued with issues like stuttering, blurry visuals, and crashes. Despite these challenges, Guerrilla Games, the developer behind the game, has released their third patch aimed at fixing these bugs and enhancing the player's overall experience.

The new update comes with a long list of improvements and new features, starting with the crash fixes that caused many players to become frustrated. The team has addressed a plethora of stability concerns, improving the chances of success in every gaming session. One of the most significant fixes is the resolution to the game's graphical display, which should sharpen the graphics and make it look much clearer than before.

Furthermore, players will rejoice at the optimization fixes included in this update. This means that the game will run with stable frame rates, and the graphics will display in a better resolution with faster load times than before. Other notable improvements include the addition of new display options, such as the addition of an aspect ratio option to support Ultrawide monitors.

Gamers have been longing for a fix to the issues faced during melee combat, and Patch 1.03 has addressed that too. Players can now look forward to smoother, more engaging, and rewarding close-combat encounters. Besides, enemies’ response times and movements have been adjusted, resulting in an improved and more immersive gameplay experience. While the issues with the game's inventory and crafting mechanics have not been resolved in this update, the developer has promised that they would be addressed in future updates.

Horizon Zero Dawn Patch 1.03 also introduces new gameplay features, such as the introduction of an option for controller button prompts via the in-game display settings. Players can now see which buttons correspond to the PlayStation 4 controller. This makes the transition to a console controller an easier and seamless experience. 

In conclusion, the third patch for Horizon Zero Dawn on PC is excellent news for fans of the game who have been eagerly waiting for a stable, polished version of the game. Apart from addressing connectivity and optimization issues, Patch 1.03 also adds new features, which should make the overall gaming experience much more enjoyable. Even though the developer promises more updates to come, this patch serves as a beacon of hope to the game's loyal fanbase, who can once again immerse themselves in the breathtakingly beautiful and dangerous world of Aloy.

Guerrilla Games has published recently the patch 1.03 of Horizon Zero Dawn on PC, which goes to fix further bugs that have caused some problems to the players since the launch or that have started to occur with the previous updates released.
 
Among the crash fix, we find a fix for a leak of the video card resources, for a crash caused by a problem of GPU, for a crash caused by artificial intelligence, a crash caused by the sound of Horizon Zero Dawn, and the shift to a different monitor with different DPI settings in the menu.
 
Also fixed a progressing issue where Aloy would get stuck in a certain state during the start of the adventure of Horizon Zero Dawn, thus preventing the player from moving forward. There is no shortage of functionality fixes, when for example the snow deformation did not work correctly or when a certain skill did not work.
