# Never Pay Full Price Again: Microsoft Edge's Secret Shopping Coupon Feature Will Save You Thousands!

Are you a seasoned online shopper, always on the lookout for discounts and deals before hitting the "buy" button? Or are you someone who frequently forgets to use coupons and cashback offers while shopping online? Either way, you're in luck – Microsoft Edge, the web browser from tech giant Microsoft, has a secret feature that can help you save big on your online purchases. It's called the "Shopping Coupon" feature, and once you start using it, you'll wonder how you ever shopped without it.

## What is the Shopping Coupon feature?

The Shopping Coupon feature is a built-in tool in Microsoft Edge that searches for and applies available coupons and promo codes to your online purchases. When you're shopping on a website, the feature automatically detects if there are any active coupons or discounts available for that site. If there are, it will show a notification in the browser, letting you know how many coupons are found. You can then click on the notification to see the available coupons and select the one that applies to your purchase.

## How does it work?

To use the Shopping Coupon feature, you'll need to have Microsoft Edge installed on your computer or mobile device. Once you've opened the browser, navigate to the website you want to shop from, and add items to your cart as usual. If there are any active coupons available, the Shopping Coupon feature will show a notification in the top-right corner of the browser window. Click on the notification to see the available coupons and select the one that applies to your purchase.

The Shopping Coupon feature is also smart enough to detect invalid coupons or expired promo codes, so you don't have to waste time trying out various codes that won't work. Plus, it works with a wide range of popular online retailers, including Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and more.

## What are the benefits of using the Shopping Coupon feature?

The biggest benefit of using the Shopping Coupon feature is that it can save you a lot of money on your online purchases. Depending on the available coupons and the items you're buying, you could potentially save anywhere from a few dollars to thousands of dollars. Over time, these savings can add up significantly, making a noticeable difference in your budget.

Another benefit of the Shopping Coupon feature is that it saves you time and hassle. Instead of manually searching for coupons and promo codes, the feature does the work for you, letting you focus on finding the best product at the best price. Plus, since the feature works across a wide range of online retailers, you don't have to switch between different coupon-finding websites or browser extensions.

## How to start using the Shopping Coupon feature

If you're already using Microsoft Edge as your web browser, the Shopping Coupon feature should be automatically enabled. However, if you've disabled the feature or if you're using a different browser, here's how to enable it:

1. Open Microsoft Edge and click on the three-dot menu icon in the top-right corner.
2. Click on "Settings" and then scroll down to "Privacy, search, and services."
3. Click on "Services" and then toggle on the "Save time and money" option under "Shopping Coupons."

Once the feature is enabled, you can start using it right away by shopping online as usual. Keep an eye out for the notification in the top-right corner of the browser window, and click on it to see the available coupons.

## Conclusion

If you're looking to save money and time on your online purchases, Microsoft Edge's Shopping Coupon feature is a game-changer. With this feature, you'll never have to pay full price again, and you'll be able to find the best deals without the hassle of manually searching for coupons and promo codes. So next time you're shopping online, give the feature a try – your wallet will thank you!
