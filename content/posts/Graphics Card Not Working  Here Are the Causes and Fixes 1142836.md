# Is Your Graphics Card Failing? Learn the Unexpected Reasons and Quick Fixes Now!

Do you often notice glitches, lags, or other anomalies while playing games or running video editing software? These signs may indicate that your graphics card is failing or having issues. While poor hardware quality could be a potential cause, it’s essential to understand that several other factors could contribute to graphics card problems. Luckily, most of these issues can be addressed quickly with proper diagnoses and simple fixes. Let’s explore some of the unexpected reasons and quick remedies to troubleshoot your graphics card.

## Overheating

Graphics cards typically generate a lot of heat, and if the temperature elevates beyond a certain range, it can cause severe problems, including random shutdowns, crashes, or even permanent hardware damage. This can be caused by inadequate cooling or poor air circulation in your computer casing. Therefore, it’s crucial to ensure proper ventilation by adding more fans, regularly cleaning the dust from your hardware, or using a liquid cooling system. You may also try to decrease your graphics card’s workload by lowering the game or software settings to prevent overheating. 

## Outdated Drivers

Like most hardware devices, updating the graphics card drivers is essential for its efficient functioning. Outdated or missing drivers may cause several issues such as black screens or poor performance. You can update your drivers manually from the graphics card manufacturer's website or use software like Driver Booster or TechPowerUp to detect and install the latest drivers automatically.

## Power Surges or Voltage Fluctuations

Power surges or voltage changes can severely affect the graphics card, leading to glitches or sudden crashes. This usually happens due to power fluctuations from the electrical outlet or a faulty PSU (power supply unit). You may consider investing in a good quality surge protector to protect your hardware from possible electrical damage. If the problem persists, you may need to replace the power supply unit.

## Malware or Virus Infection

Malware or virus infections can cause system instability and disrupt the graphics card functions. This can be seen in the form of freezes, crashes, or other anomalies. Investing in comprehensive antivirus software can help prevent or reduce malware or virus infections. Periodic scanning is essential to detect any infections and remove them immediately.

## Overclocking

Overclocking is an activity in which users deliberately increase the graphics card’s clock speed to improve its performance. While overclocking can give a considerable performance boost, it can also cause damage to your graphics card. Overclocking increases heat production, leading to accelerated wear and tear on the card’s components. It’s advisable to avoid overclocking your graphics card, especially if it’s an old card.

In conclusion, if you suspect that your graphics card is failing, there may be a range of reasons other than hardware failure. You should first diagnose the potential causes and try the recommended fixes. If none of the suggested remedies work, you may need to seek expert help. However, most of the problems can be resolved with a little bit of effort on your part. Regular maintenance and upgrades can help ensure your hardware’s longevity, and you can enjoy uninterrupted gaming or video editing. 

We hope this article has helped you learn more about unexpected reasons behind graphics card problems and quick fixes for the same. Happy gaming!

From video games to professional 3D work, a graphics card is an essential piece of kit for those who want to push their computers to the next level of graphics rendering. Unfortunately, as is usually the case with adding extra hardware to a computer, graphics cards come with their own sets of problems and issues. If your graphics card is not working, it can be frustrating, especially for those who aren’t experienced with graphics cards and don’t know how to diagnose errors. 
 
Here are the symptoms of a faulty graphics card and how you can fix it when a graphics card is not working.
 
## The Symptoms
 
### Games Underperforming
 
It’s a tale as old as time. You buy a new gaming laptop or GPU having heard that it will run at searingly fast framerates, but when it comes to actually running the games, it’s performing 30% or worse below expectations. 
 
It’s one thing for the framerate in a game to be a little bit below (or above) what you expect – there are many variables to consider. But if your GPU is running way below expectations, then you should start looking into solutions.
 
### Computer Crashes
 
Graphics cards that have gone rogue can cause a PC to crash. These crashes can be varied, from a simple bluescreen, to a “lockup” (where the PC freezes but doesn’t show a bluescreen), to random restarts and powering off. Not every crash will be caused by the graphics card, but if you have memory dumps enabled, and they blame the graphics card driver,  you can safely say it’s the culprit.
 
### Artifacting
 
When something is going wrong with the graphics card, you may notice this via bizarre visuals onscreen. This is because the graphics card is how the PC “draws” onto the monitor. Colors will look strange, 3D models will stretch for no reason, “digital snow” will appear, or the entire screen will be covered in visual garbage.
 
### Loud Fan Sounds
 
When you boot software that uses 3D graphics (or even when you boot up the computer!), you may hear what sounds like a small jet aircraft taking off within the PC. This is the telltale sound of one of your system fans going into overtime. If this fan is the one on your graphics card, it may be a sign that something’s not quite well with it.
 
### Driver Crashes
 
Sometimes you’ll be using your PC normally when the screen will go black for a few seconds. When it returns, you’ll be informed that the video drivers have crashed and had to be restarted. This won’t crash your whole PC but can be very annoying if it happens frequently.
 
### Black Screens
 
Sometimes you won’t see any visual clues at all! A graphics card gone bad can simply decide to stop working and not display anything. You’ll have to resort to integrated graphics or a cheap “throwaway” graphics card to see if it’s your card or your monitor acting up. If it works with either of those, it’s most likely your graphics card at fault.
 
## The Fixes
 
While many of the above are symptoms of a dying graphics card, it doesn’t always mean it’s on its way out. There are a few things you can try to fix the graphics card before you cast a final judgement on it and buy a new one.
 
## Make Sure Your GPU Is Enabled
 
This one particularly applies to laptops, but may also apply to desktops if your CPU has an integrated GPU on it.
 
Many laptops have a built-in feature that when you unplug them from the power, they automatically disable the dedicated GPU to preserve battery life. Sometimes this feature can remain enabled even if you’re plugged into the power, or you may have set it to “always on” at some point.
 
There are a few ways to ensure your GPU is enabled:
 
If you have an Nvidia GPU, go to Nvidia Control Panel, then under “Manage 3D Settings,” click the Program Settings tab, navigate to the game you’re having trouble with, then in the “Select the preferred graphics processor” drop-down, select “High-performance NVIDIA processor.”
 
Some laptops offer their own software that lets you switch the GPU on and off with one click. On my laptop, for instance, ASUS Armory Crate does that job. Under “System Configuration,” I can switch off “iGPU mode” to enable my Nvidia GPU or just turn it to “Off” so my Nvidia GPU is on permanently.
 
If neither of those work, go into your laptop BIOS (press the designated key – usually F2 or F8 – when booting your PC) and see if you can enable your dedicated graphics from there. Alternatively, try disabling your iGPU, which may trigger your dedicated GPU to start working.
 
### Change In-Game Settings
 
If the problems only appear in specific games, they may not actually be problems.
 
The modern GPUs produce 3D graphics through three different APIs: DirectX, OpenGL, and Vulkan. Most games allow you to choose the rendering API with a visit to their advanced graphical settings. To complicate things, there are different versions of those APIs, with varying levels of support depending on the driver, GPU, and operating system combination. 
 
Certain GPUs don’t play nice with certain settings. Both AMD and Nvidia GPUs quite often have certain graphical features that are specifically designed for one card or the other (such as DLSS and ray-tracing for Nvidia, and FidelityFX for AMD).
 
Enabling features not made for your brand of GPU can result in problems. An infamous example is Nvidia HairWorks for The Witcher 3, which worked fine on Nvidia cards but absolutely ruined the framerate on AMD.
 
### Update the Drivers
 
Graphics card drivers can be fickle. If they’re outdated, they can cause issues when playing more modern games. If the graphics card is old, newer drivers can do more harm than good for system stability. Sometimes you’ll have a very recent graphics card and up-to-date drivers, and your computer will still crash regardless!
 
If you haven’t updated your graphics card drivers in a while, update them via NVidia, AMD, or Intel, depending on the manufacturer. Alternatively, if you have recently updated the drivers, try rolling back the driver to an earlier date or installing older drivers via your vendor’s driver archive.
 
### Full Driver Removal
 
You might have recently upgraded your GPU but also jumped ship between brands – for example, moving from an AMD GPU to one made by Nvidia. In this case, it’s best to fully uninstall the previous GPU drivers. Unfortunately, their official uninstallers tend to leave traces behind. Thankfully, there is a third-party solution for that problem: Display Driver Uninstaller.
 
Download Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU for short) from its official page at Guru 3D and run it before swapping your GPU or installing your desired driver. Use it to eliminate any traces of existing display drivers, and then either shut down your computer and replace your GPU with the new one or restart and install different display drivers. This is also useful while troubleshooting display problems since it allows you to ensure that their source isn’t a driver conflict.
 
### Cool It Down
 
There’s a chance the graphics card is experiencing issues due to overheating. This will be especially relevant if the errors only happen after rendering 3D graphics for a while or if you notice your graphics card’s fan getting extremely loud during rendering. If this is the case, check the temperature of your graphics card to see how hot it gets.
 
You can combat overheating by removing the graphics card and cleaning any dust using compressed air. You can even open the card itself and refresh the thermal paste within, although this shouldn’t be attempted by beginners. There are also tools to regulate the graphics card’s fan and graphical output, such as MSI Afterburner.
 
### Make Sure It’s Properly Seated
 
Graphics cards need to be properly seated in their PCI slots in order to work efficiently. If they require additional power plugs to operate, these need to be firmly plugged in without wiggle room. Failure to do either (or both!) may cause errors related to the graphics card. Ensure the card is properly slotted into the PCi and screwed in tight. Ensure any power connectors that are needed for operation are properly clipped into the unit.
 
### Check the Video Cable
 
If the cable from your PC to your graphics card goes awry, it can create weird visual effects. If something visually strange happens, ensure the video cable is properly plugged in on both sides or replace the cable.
 
### Check the Monitor
 
Visual glitches may not even be the graphics card at all but instead a sign that the monitor is on its way out. If none of the above works, try replacing either the monitor or graphics card. If the problem goes away, whatever you replaced was the culprit.
 
### Replace the Card
 
Sometimes, however, the symptoms are simply a sign of a card past its prime. If you truly suspect that nothing can bring the card back from its current state, you can try purchasing a very cheap graphics card to see it if works on your PC. If the issues stop, consider buying a better new card!
