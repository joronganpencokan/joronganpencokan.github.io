## Unleash The Power Of Linux: Discover The Ultimate Command Line Hack To Monitor Network Load Like A Pro!

If you've been using Linux for a while, you'll know that it's a powerful operating system that offers a lot of flexibility to users. One of the most useful features of Linux is its command line interface. With the right tools, you can do almost anything from the command line, including monitoring your network load. In this article, we're going to show you the ultimate command line hack to monitor network load like a pro!

### Why Monitor Network Load?

Before we jump into the command line tool, let's take a look at why you should monitor your network load. Network load refers to the amount of data that is being transferred between your computer and other devices or servers on your network. There are several reasons why you might want to monitor your network load:

- **Detecting network issues**: Monitoring your network load can help you detect issues like bandwidth congestion or network bottlenecks. By monitoring network load, you can quickly identify any issues that might be slowing down your network and take steps to rectify them.

- **Optimizing network performance**: By monitoring network load, you can optimize your network performance by identifying areas where bandwidth can be allocated more effectively. By optimizing your network, you can improve overall network performance and reduce latency.

- **Securing your network**: Monitoring network load can also help you identify suspicious activity on your network, such as unauthorized access or data exfiltration. By monitoring your network load, you can quickly identify and respond to any suspicious activity.

Now that you understand the importance of monitoring network load let's take a look at the command line tool you can use to do this.

### The Ultimate Command Line Hack: Using "iftop"

The "iftop" tool is a command line program that allows you to monitor network load in real-time. It shows you the network bandwidth usage by different hosts on your network, which can help you quickly identify any issues or suspicious activity.

Here's how to use iftop on Linux:

1. Open a terminal window on your Linux machine.

2. Type "iftop" in the command prompt and hit "Enter." You'll see a real-time view of the network traffic on your machine.

3. To see network traffic for a specific interface, type "iftop -i [interface-name]" For example, to see traffic on the eth0 interface, type "iftop -i eth0"

4. By default, iftop will display traffic sorted by the total amount of data transferred. However, you can sort the traffic by source IP address or destination IP address by pressing "s" and then typing "s" for source or "d" for destination.

5. To exit iftop, simply press "q" and the program will close.

### Conclusion

By using the "iftop" tool on Linux, you can monitor your network load like a pro. By keeping a close eye on your network traffic, you can quickly identify any issues or suspicious activity and take steps to rectify them. So why not give it a try and see how it can help you optimize your network performance and keep your network secure?

If you are a network administrator, you’surely know the importance of network traffic monitoring. While there is some excellent GUI-based software available for this, if you’re dealing with command line and are looking for a command-line alternative, I’d suggest you try slurm.
 
In this article, we will discuss the slurm command along with the features it provides.
 
## Introduction
 
Described by its man page as “yet another network load monitor”, Slurm is a generic network load monitor which shows device statistics together with a nice ascii graph – it supports multiple types of graphs.
 
For those interested in its origins, the project started as a FreeBSD port of the Linux ppp link monitor called “pppstatus.” Aside from Linux, the command works on many other platforms including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, HP-UX, MicroBSD, and Mac OS X.
 
## Download and Install
 
Users of Debian-based systems, like Ubuntu, can easily download and install this utility using the following command:
 
Alternatively, you can also download its source code  and install manually.
 
## Usage
 
Here are some examples of how the slurm command can be used:
 
Note: all examples presented in this article are tested on Ubuntu 14.04.
 
### Default output
 
To use the slurm command, the first thing that you have to do is let it know which network interface you want to monitor, something you can do by passing the interface name as an argument to the -i command line option.
 
For example, in my case, I wanted to monitor the “wlan0” interface, so I executed the command in the following way:
 
and the following output was produced:
 

 
As can be seen in the above screen shot, the command produced information related to network traffic both in text as well as in form of a graph, which scrolls from left to right according to network usage.
 
Although the command’s man page, as well the project page, does not provide any information about the graph as well as the data it depicts, it’s apparent that the green X’s indicate downloads and the Red X’s indicate uploads. Each column in the graph depicts network load (download + upload) at any given second, which means the more X’s in a particular column, the more the network load at that second in time.
 
### Other graph modes
 
Aside from the default graph mode, the command also offers classic as well as split and large split graph mode.
 
To start the command with classic/combined graph, use the -c command line option:
 
Similarly, to start the command in the split graph mode, use the -s command line option:
 
Finally, to start the command in large split graph mode, use the -l command line option:
 
### Change the delay between screen updates
 
By default, the command updates the output after one second. However, you can change this by using the -d command line option. For example, to change the delay to 3 seconds, I used the following command:
 
## Conclusion
 
Slurm is lightweight and easy-to-use command line tool for monitoring network activity. Although it does not provide a lot of features, it delivers what it claims. Also, if you want, you can try integrating it with tools like Conky to make the most of it.
