# Strategies and Tips
The best way to approach the Chongqing challenge is to take your time and learn the environment to exploit every possible weakness. Try to find disguise boxes, use the crowds to your advantage, and plan your hits carefully. Use distractions and lure guards away from their posts, create opportunities to knock out the targets without attracting attention, and be aware of alternative routes to escape when the heat is on.

 - Once you reach Level 4 of the building, you can find a Researcher disguise in the bathroom. Or you can take one from a Researcher if you are fast enough to subdue and take it off them.
 - Researcher disguise will give you access to everywhere in all levels in the building. Block Guard disguise will also give you access to the lab.
 - Now as you have access to the lab, subdue all scientists one by one, or else sabotage all 4 of the test pods fast hidden from NPC’s view.
