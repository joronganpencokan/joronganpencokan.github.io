Title: You Won't Believe What You Need to Do BEFORE Installing Windows 7 - Must-Know Tips! Part 1

Introduction:

Windows 7 is one of the most popular operating systems in the world, but installing it is not as simple as just popping in the setup disk and hitting "install." There are many things you need to do before installing Windows 7 to ensure a smooth and trouble-free installation. In this two-part article, we'll explore must-know tips to follow before installing Windows 7.

Tip 1: Check Your Hardware

The first thing you need to do is check if your hardware is compatible with Windows 7. Check if your computer's processor meets the minimum requirements of Windows 7. If your CPU is outdated, it may not support the latest features of Windows 7, which could cause problems during installation or after installation. You should also check if your computer has enough RAM, hard drive space, and a compatible graphics card.

To check the compatibility of your hardware, you can use Microsoft's Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor tool. This tool scans your computer and checks if your hardware and software are compatible with Windows 7.

Tip 2: Back Up Your Data

Before installing Windows 7, you should back up all your important data, including documents, music, pictures, and videos. This is because the installation process may require you to format your hard drive, which means you will lose all your data. By backing up your data, you can ensure that you don't lose anything important during the installation process.

You can back up your data to an external hard drive, USB drive, or cloud storage service. Make sure to have a copy of your backup in case your primary backup fails.

Tip 3: Uninstall Nonessential Programs

Before installing Windows 7, you should uninstall all nonessential programs from your computer. This includes programs that you haven't used in a long time, programs you installed for a one-time use, or programs that you no longer need.

Uninstalling nonessential programs will clean up your computer's hard drive and free up space for the operating system. This will ensure that the installation process runs smoothly without any errors.

Tip 4: Update Your Drivers

To ensure that your computer's hardware works properly with Windows 7, you should update your drivers. Drivers are software that allows your computer's hardware to communicate with the operating system.

You can go to the manufacturer's website to download the latest drivers for your hardware. Make sure to download the drivers for Windows 7 specifically.

Conclusion:

Before installing Windows 7, you should follow these four tips to ensure a smooth and trouble-free installation. Checking your hardware, backing up your data, uninstalling nonessential programs, and updating your drivers are all crucial steps before installing Windows 7. In the next part of this article, we'll explore more tips to follow before installing Windows 7.

On how to install Windows 7 — What to do before start (which is the first part of three-part tutorial on the preinstallation of Windows 7 and it will continue throughout other tutorials, detailing various ways to install the operating system in your computer), we are going to cover when this process is useful. We’ll explain what you need to know and do before start the installation process including, what are Windows 7 hardware requirements, and how to prepare your computer to install Windows 7. There is a lot to go through so let’s get started.
 
Doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a power user, the Windows 7 installation process is almost inescapable. Knowing the secrets of upgrade, dual-boot, reinstall, and perform a clean installation can set a big difference between a system running in harmony and a box of troubles. If you have previous experience with the Windows Vista setup, many of those skills will continue to be useful. However if you are moving from Windows XP to Windows 7, this will be a whole new learning experience.
 
This what to do before start tutorial should be useful if you are planning to dual-boot, reinstall, upgrade or install Windows 7 in a brand new or a computer/laptop with a previous version of Windows on it.
 
It is also recommended that if your computer has been infected with viruses or getting slow due to many installed applications through out the time, a clean Windows 7 install is what you need and it will get your computer back to speed again.
 
## What are Windows 7 hardware requirements
 
Let’s start by getting to know the minimum hardware requirement for the editions of Windows 7 (Home Premium, Professional, and Ultimate). Check the table below:
 
## How to prepare your system to install Windows 7
 
For this process you’ll need the original installation copy of Windows 7 media (DVD or any other bootable drive) and the product key. To find more information about the product key and where to find it, check this Microsoft web page.
 
1 GB RAM (32-bit)
 
2 GB RAM (64-bit), and to take advantage of the power of 64-bit
 
I will recommend you to have at least 4 GB of RAM
 
16 GB available of disk space (32-bit)
 
20 GB available of disk space (64-bit)
 
Applications that were released for earlier versions of Windows, for example, Windows XP and Windows Vista, they may not work properly in Windows 7, and the same applies for older hardware; some of them will require device drivers that were never updated for use in Windows 7, and the last thing you need after spending a long time on performing the installation, is to realize that there are compatibility problems, right after the first log-in or when you try to use a particular device or application.
 
To save time and headaches, if the computer you are about to install or upgrade Windows 7 is currently running Windows XP Service Pack 2 or higher, or any version of Windows Vista. You can download and run the free Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor to see if your computer is capable of running Windows 7. This tool will scan your hardware, devices, and installed programs for known compatibility issues, and it will report potential issues found and how to resolve theme, and any other recommendation before you start the process. 
 
To take extra precaution installing Windows 7 in an older machine, check Windows 7 Compatibility Center — a.k.a HCL (Hardware Compatibility List) — to see if your hardware and peripherals are compatible with Windows 7. 
 
## Be prepared to avoid software compatibility problems
 
In the case you are upgrading your computer’s operating system, be cautious with all the applications you depend on. If some of the software currently installed was originally designed to work with a previous version of Microsoft Windows, it is not wrong for you to think that they may not work properly in Windows 7, perhaps an upgrade for those pieces of software may be required. Windows 7 will support most of Windows vista certified programs, but this is not always the case. You should at least check your everyday applications for compatibility.
 
There are some type of software that are likely to cause some problems when upgrading or performing a clean Windows 7 installation, some of them include:
 
- Firewalls and other type of  security utilities
 - Antivirus and anti-spyware software
 - Maintenance tools, such as disk partitioning
 - Software that interact with CDs and DVDs

 
When upgrading consider the following: disable or uninstall any antivirus software and other utilities, if you think that they may cause problems. You can always install them back after the process.
 
It is recommended that in the case the Upgrade Advisor finds any issues regarding compatibility with Windows 7, you uninstall the programs in question before proceeding with the upgrade. 
 
And here we conclude the first part of the preinstallation process on how to install Windows 7, where you learned many things such as what are Windows 7 minimum system requirements, and we also looked at some compatibility issues that you may encounter and how to solve them. In part 2 we’ll talk about how to protect your data before embarking in the installation process of Windows 7.
