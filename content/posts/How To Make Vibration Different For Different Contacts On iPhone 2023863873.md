# Revolutionary iPhone Hack: Learn How to Make YOUR Contacts Give You Custom Vibrations in 2023!

Are you tired of boring, generic vibrations for your incoming iPhone calls and messages? Do you wish you could differentiate between important and casual contacts just by feeling your phone buzz in your pocket? If so, you're in luck! A revolutionary iPhone hack has been discovered that allows you to give custom vibrations to each of your contacts.

This game-changing hack, discovered by a group of tech enthusiasts in 2023, allows users to create unique vibrations for each individual contact on their iPhone. By doing so, you can easily differentiate between calls or messages from your boss, your significant other, your best friend, or anyone else in your contact list.

So how does this hack work? It's surprisingly simple. Here's a step-by-step guide to get started:

1. First, head to the Settings app on your iPhone and click on Sounds and Haptics.
2. Scroll down to the "Ringtone and Vibration" section and select "Vibration".
3. Select "Create New Vibration" and tap out a unique pattern using the touch screen.
4. Once you've created your custom vibration, you'll be prompted to name it.
5. Head back to your contact list and select the person you'd like to assign the custom vibration to.
6. Click on "Edit" in the top right corner and scroll down to "Vibration".
7. Select your custom vibration from the list and you're done!

Now, whenever that contact calls or messages you, your iPhone will vibrate with the unique pattern you've assigned to them.

But the possibilities don't stop there. You can even create different vibrations for different types of messages or notifications. For example, you could assign a subtle vibration for text messages, a more intense one for phone calls, and a rapid vibration for urgent alerts.

This revolutionary hack is a game-changer for iPhone users who constantly receive calls and messages from different contacts throughout the day. No longer will you have to fumble around in your pocket or purse trying to figure out who's trying to reach you - you'll know right away just by the unique vibration pattern.

Assigning a unique ringtone for individual contacts will help you to figure out the person who is calling from the sound itself before even looking at your iPhone screen. 
 
This can be handy when you wish to reach out to your phone for only important contacts while ignoring them for other desired ones. 
 
Here in this article, we will throw some light on the methods to set a different ringtone for each contact on iPhone. Not only ringtone but you can also set different vibration patterns for contacts as well.

## Assign Unique Ringtone And Vibration To A Specific Contact On iPhone
 
Apart from using the default ringtones that come with iOS, you can also set any other custom tone like a song or music as a contact ringtone. 
 
In order to do that, you need to first make your own ringtone with iTunes and sync it to your iPhone. 
 
Once you have made a few ringtones and added them to your iPhone by following the method mentioned in the link earlier then you are ready to assign those ringtones to contacts.
 
Follow the steps given below to have a customized ringtone for contacts :
 
- Open the Phone app and select the Contacts tab.Tap on the Contact to which you want to assign a ringtone.On selecting the contact, details for that contact will open up. Tap on Edit at the top right corner of the screen.Now, you will see a Ringtone option as shown in the screenshot below. Tap on it. Next, you’ll be able to see all the ringtones added to your iPhone in the Ringtones section. Select the desired one by tapping on it.From this screen itself, you can also change the Vibration for a specific contact. For that, tap on Vibration and select the one you wish. You can also create and assign your own custom vibrations like ringtones(more on this later in the article). After that, go back to the previous screen by tapping on the back button at the top left corner.Once you’re satisfied with the ringtone and vibration, tap on Done at the top right corner of the screen.If desired you can also change the notification tone for text messages from that contact. To so tap on Text Tone and select the desired ringtone and vibration for texts.In order to save the changes, tap on Done at the right corner of the screen.

 
With this, the selected ringtone and vibration is assigned to the contact. By default, every contact uses the ringtone that is set in the Settings but the one assigned from here overrules the default one.
 
Similarly, you can follow the same method and assign a different ringtone for other contacts.
 
### Another Case Where These Settings Can Come In Handy
 
If you wish to silence calls from specific contacts then you can assign them a silent ringtone and vibration as None which is present at the bottom in the list of available Vibration patterns.
 
### Create Custom Vibration On iPhone
 
- Follow the same steps 1-4 from the method above.After that, select Vibration.On the Vibration screen, select Create New Vibration.Now tap on the screen to create the desired pattern. For short vibration just tap and release while for a longer vibration, you need to long press on the screen.If you are able to complete your pattern before the allowed time then you can tap on Stop at the bottom right.Once you are done creating the pattern, you can preview it by tapping on Play at the bottom left. If you want to give it another shot then tap on Record to make the pattern again. In case you are happy with the current one then tap on Save at the top right.Next, give it a desired name and tap on Save.With this, it will be automatically set as the Vibration for that contact. Moreover, it will also be available to be assigned to other contacts in the Custom section. Now, don’t forget to tap on Done in Ringtone and main contact card screen to save the changes.

 
You can change the default ringtone for all contacts so that you don’t have to listen to the same tone all the time.
 
### Change Default Ringtone And Vibration For All Contacts
 
- Go to Settings.Select Sounds. In the latest models, it will be Sounds & Haptics.Now, select Ringtone.Select the desired tone.To change the default vibration tap on Vibration and select the desired pattern.

 
That’s all there’s to it. Assigning ringtone and vibration from here will set it as the default one for all the contacts unless you change it using the methods in this tutorial above.
