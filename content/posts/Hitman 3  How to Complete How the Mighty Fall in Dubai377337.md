Another aspect to keep in mind is the variety of tools at your disposal. From fiber wire to silenced weapons, there are numerous options for eliminating targets. It's essential to choose the right tool for each situation, whether that's opting for a choking instead of a lethal takedown or waiting in the shadows for the perfect moment to strike.

If you're up for the challenge, consider playing the "How The Mighty Fall" mission on the highest difficulty, Master. This adds an extra layer of difficulty to the game, with more guards and tighter security. You'll need to be incredibly stealthy and aware of your surroundings to complete the mission without getting caught.
