Unlock the Power of Your Mac: Discover the Secret to Opening Files in Multiple Apps!

If you're a Mac user, you may be unaware of a powerful feature that can help you unlock the full potential of your computer. The ability to open files in multiple apps is a simple yet highly effective way to improve your productivity and streamline your workflow. In this article, we'll show you how to do it and explain why it's such a game-changer.

What is Opening Files in Multiple Apps?

When you double-click on a file on your Mac, it typically opens in the app that is associated with that file type. For example, if you double-click on a .doc file, it will open in Microsoft Word. However, you can also open files in multiple apps simultaneously.

This means that, instead of opening a file in one specific app, you can open it in several apps at the same time. For example, you could open the same document in both Word and Pages, or you could open a video file in QuickTime and VLC.

How to Open Files in Multiple Apps

Opening files in multiple apps is simple. All you need to do is:

1. Select the file you want to open.

2. Right-click on the file.

3. Click on "Open With."

4. Select the first app you want to open the file in.

5. Hold down the Command key and select any additional apps you want to open the file in.

6. Click OK, and the file will open in all of the selected apps simultaneously.

Why You Should Open Files in Multiple Apps

There are several benefits to opening files in multiple apps, including:

1. Increased Productivity - Using this feature, you can quickly switch between several apps to complete tasks. This can save you time and increase your productivity.

2. Cross-App Compatibility - Some apps may function differently from others. Opening a single file in multiple apps can offer you a chance to check compatibility across the apps. 

3. Compare Different Software - If you're trying to decide between two different apps, you can open the same file in both and compare the features of each to determine which is the best fit for your needs.

4. Accessing More Features - Some apps excel in certain fields, while others cover more general functions. Opening files in multiple apps allows you to utilize a wide range of features and further enhance your productivity.

Conclusion

Opening files in multiple apps is a useful feature of the Mac that can help you unlock the full potential of your computer. Whether you're looking to increase your productivity or compare features of different software, this simple trick can transform the way you work. So why not give it a try today and see how it can streamline your workflow and make you a more efficient Mac user?

Every file format on your Mac has an app associated with it that it launches when you open that specific type of file. For example, all the image files on your Mac may be set to launch with Preview. When you try to open a file on your Mac, you are actually presented with a couple of options to choose from as to how you would like to open the file. These options are “Open with” and “Always Open With.”
 
Most Mac users get confused as to how these options differ from each other. Since Apple has added them separately to your context menu, there has to be a reason for that. This way Apple lets you open a file in different apps on your Mac. For instance, a PDF file can be opened and read in both Adobe Reader and Preview, and it is up to you to decide which one you would like to open it with.
 
In this article we will show you how you can open a file in different apps using Mac’s different options.
 
## Using the “Open With” Menu for Opening a File
 
When you right-click on a file on your Mac, you see the option “Open With.” The option allows you to select an app other than the default one to launch your file. For instance, the image files usually launch with Preview on your Mac, but if you would like to launch a image in Photoshop, you can do so using the “Open With” option located in the context menu.
 

 
When you select this option you can see a bunch of apps that the selected file can be opened with. If you have right-clicked on an image file, you will only see the apps that can access an image file, and so on.
 
Let’s say you chose to open an image file with Photoshop; it will not open in the same app the next time. It will revert back to its default app to open.
 
## Using the “Always Open With” Menu for Opening a File
 
The next option available for opening a file is “Always Open With.” As the name implies, it allows you to always open a file in a particular app.
 
For example, if you have a file named “IMG1.png” on your Mac and would like for that specific file to always launch in Photoshop instead of Preview, you can use the “Always Open With” option.
 
You can see the “Always Open With” option when you right-click on a file and hold down the Option key on your keyboard.
 
The option only works for that particular file and not the files that have that specific file extension. As in the above example, not all the PNG format files will launch in Photoshop even though you have selected the “IMG1.png” file to launch with that app.
 
## Using the “Change All” Option for Opening Files
 
The third option is “Change All.” This option lets you select a default app for the specified file type. For instance, if you would like to open all your PDF files in Adobe Reader instead of Preview, you can use the “Change All” option, and it will always launch all your PDF files in the Adobe Reader app.
 
The “Change All” option can be accessed by right-clicking on the desired file and selecting “Get Info.” That is where you can set a default app for a specific file type.
 
## Conclusion
 
If you have been wondering the difference between the various file launching options all this time, the above guide explains them in detail for you.
