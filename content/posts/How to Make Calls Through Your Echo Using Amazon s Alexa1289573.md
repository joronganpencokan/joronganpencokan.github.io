### 
What to Know
 
- Pair your phone: Alexa app > Devices > Echo & Alexa > select your device > Bluetooth Devices > Pair a New Device.To call someone, open the Alexa app > communicate icon > person icon > tap person > select Call.

 
##   Connect Alexa to Your Phone with the Alexa App  
 

The Alexa app is actually a critical piece of the puzzle. You need it before you can do any of the other steps in this how-to, as does anyone you want to call. If you don't have the latest version of the app installed on your iPhone or Android device, take a minute to visit the App Store or Google Play and check. Now's the time to nag your parents, best friend, sister, or neighbor to get updating as well.

 

Once Alexa is downloaded and updated, pair your Echo with your smartphone using the below instructions:

 
- Open the Alexa app and select Devices > Echo & Alexa.
 - Select your device.
 - Select Bluetooth Devices > Pair a New Device.

 
##   Confirm Your Number  
 

Open the Alexa app and select Devices > Echo & Alexa.

 

Select your device.

 

Select Bluetooth Devices > Pair a New Device.

 

If you have two-factor authentication set up on something like your email account, then this is roughly the same process.

 
##   Discover Who You Can Talk To  
 

Open the Alexa app, then tap the Communicate icon that's at the bottom of the screen. Select the person icon that's at the top of the page in the upper-right corner. This brings up a list of your contacts that have also have updated their Alexa app.

 

To place calls with Alexa, a person has to be saved in your phone as a contact and have an updated version of the app running on their phone. This list is likely shorter than your entire contacts list, so pay attention to whom you can actually call.

 
Alternatively, you can select Make a Call from the Home screen to see your Alexa contacts.
 

To call anyone on that list, select their name, then select Call. You can also ask Alexa to call someone by using a voice command like "Alexa, call Bob!"

 
##   Answer Calls on Your Phone or Echo  
 

Once you place a call, the person you're trying to reach hears their phone ring, as well as any Echo devices they have associated with their account. So, if you call your mom, her iPhone rings but so does the Echo in her kitchen. If you're the one receiving a call, simply say, "Alexa Answer" in order to have Alexa answer the phone. When you're done chatting, say, "Alexa, hang up" to end the conversation.

 

Want to leave a message instead of calling? Say, "Alexa, send a message to Bob" to create a voicemail for your friend or family member.

 
##   When You Miss a Call Through Alexa  
 

If you miss a call or someone decides to leave you a message, your Echo device glows green. When you want to hear a message, say, "Alexa, play my messages."

 

In addition to offering in-app playback of your voicemail, Alexa also transcribes your voicemails for you, so you can read a (computer-generated and possibly not super accurate) transcription of the message rather than listening to it.
