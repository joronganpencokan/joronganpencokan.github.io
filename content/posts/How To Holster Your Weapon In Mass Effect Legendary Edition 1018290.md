The first thing you need to do is understand the basics of holstering. To do this, you need to know how to holster your weapon and how it affects your movement. Holstering your weapon is easy. All you need to do is press and hold the reload button, and your weapon will disappear, allowing you to move faster. To take out your weapon again, press the reload button again.

Reloading your weapon is crucial in Mass Effect Legendary Edition. You don’t want to be caught off-guard during a battle with an empty gun. To reload your weapon, simply press the reload button. If you are out of bullets, hold the reload button to start the reload process. Always ensure that you have enough ammo before entering a battle.

To become a pro in holstering your weapon, you need to practice regularly. Practice with different weapons and in different situations. Try holstering your weapon during battles, while running, and even while jumping. The more you practice, the better you become.

Tip #4: Use Your Surroundings 

In Mass Effect Legendary Edition, your surroundings can be used to your advantage. You can use walls, pillars, and other objects as cover during battles. By doing this, you can quickly holster your weapon and take cover during an enemy’s attack. Using your surroundings is an excellent way to increase your survivability and become a pro in holstering.

Tip #5: Timing is Key 

Timing is everything when it comes to holstering your weapon. As previously mentioned, holstered weapons allow you to move faster, making it easier to dodge enemy attacks. However, if you holster your weapon too soon or too late, you may end up being caught off-guard. Always time your holstering correctly to ensure that you’re always ready for battle.

The Mass Effect franchise is focused more on combat. Maintaining the team dynamic is also an important aspect of the game. The Legendary edition has made some changes but not here. There are multiple missions based on recruiting squad members, disagreeing with them, etc. Holstering your weapon will lead to diffusing tense situations and leading you towards a calm discussion instead of a bloodfest among the squad members. Let’s see how to holster your weapon in Mass Effect Legendary Edition

How To Holster Your Weapon In Mass Effect Legendary Edition?
 

To Holster, your weapon all you have to do is tap on the “touchpad” in Play station or press the toggle view button if you are an Xbox player. After using these buttons you will see Shepard putting his gun away. Unlike some other features, the controls to holster the weapon are the same for Mass Effect 1 and 2. While there isn’t any proven impact of holster your gun away. Many players have said that it has helped them while using the “charm” and “intermediate” feature. Makes sense as you can’t get a squad member’s trust with a gun pointed at them.
 
Unfortunately, there is no feature of holstering your gun in Mass effect 3. This inclines players towards believing that holstering your weapon is more of a gesture than a feature in the Mass Effect franchise as well as the Mass effect legendary edition. Missions like saving Wrex highly depend on getting Wrex’s trust. Pointing your gun at him wouldn’t be helpful here. The discussion you have with squad members becomes highly important as every option you choose can branch out a different path of the game. We recommend you try choosing multiple dialogues to experience all the endings and know how things will turn out.
