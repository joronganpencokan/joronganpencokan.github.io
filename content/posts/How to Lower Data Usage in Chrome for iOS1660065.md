Introduction:
In today's era, the internet is an essential part of our daily lifestyle. We are always connected to it, and we use our devices to browse the internet frequently. However, the downside of browsing the internet is that it consumes a lot of data, which means using more data can cost you higher bills. One of the most popular web browsers is Google Chrome, but it uses a lot of data while loading web pages. Luckily, there is a simple trick to reduce chrome data usage on your iPhone, saving you money and time.

Step 3: From the list, select the 'Settings' button.

Step 4: Scroll down, find the “Lite mode” option, and tap on it.

Step 5: Switch on the 'Lite mode' button.

Once you have enabled this feature, you can notice the change in your data usage. Chrome will start to load pages faster, and you will save more data while browsing. Using the Lite mode feature, you can save up to 60% of your data usage.

Conclusion:
In summary, enabling the Lite mode feature on your iPhone’s Chrome browser is a simple but effective trick to save money and time. It is an effective way to reduce data usage on your device without compromising on browsing speed or page quality.
