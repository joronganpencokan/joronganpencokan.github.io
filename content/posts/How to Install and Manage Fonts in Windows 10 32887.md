Revamp Your Typography Game with These Simple Windows 10 Font Hacks!

If you are keen on typography, then you know how significant it is to use the right typeface for the right purpose. The same sentence can appear elegant, modern, or vintage when written in different fonts. Choosing the appropriate font is just half the battle; the other half is knowing how to use it effectively. Fortunately, with the help of a few simple Windows 10 font hacks, you can take your typographical skills to the next level.

1. Explore the Font Manager

Windows 10 comes with a built-in Font Manager. This tool lets you preview, install, and uninstall fonts. To access it, go to the settings and navigate to Personalization > Fonts. You will see all the fonts installed on your computer. You can sort them alphabetically, by date, or by size. You can also toggle the hidden fonts or download more fonts from Microsoft Store.

2. Enable ClearType for Text Clarity

ClearType is a Windows Technology developed to make fonts on LCD screens appear clearer and sharper by enhancing the edge of each character. To enable ClearType, search ClearType in the Windows Search bar, select Adjust ClearType text, and follow the on-screen instructions. Once done, you will notice a significant improvement in the legibility of on-screen text.

3. Use OpenType Features for Enhanced Typography

OpenType Font Format was introduced in 1996, and it soon became the preferred format for professional typography. OpenType fonts offer more features than traditional fonts, such as advanced ligatures, swashes, fractions, and much more. Many modern fonts come with OpenType features. To access these features, open the Font Manager, select a font, and click on the "OpenType" button to see all the available options.

4. Adjust Font Sizes for Better Legibility

Choosing the right font size is critical for effective typography. A too small or too large font can cause readability issues, discomfort, and even headaches. Adjust your font size according to the screen size and the reading distance. If you are unsure, use Windows Magnifier. It will help you observe the text in greater detail.

5. Pair Fonts for a Cohesive Design

Font pairing is a strategy of combining two or more fonts in a design to create contrast, hierarchy, and interest. Good font pairing requires a sense of balance, harmony, and contrast. A general rule of thumb is to pair a serif font with a sans-serif font. For example, mix Garamond with Helvetica, or Times New Roman with Arial.

In Conclusion

Effective typography takes practice, patience, and the right tools. By following the above simple Windows 10 font hacks, you can dramatically improve your typographical skills, create more aesthetically pleasing designs, and effectively convey your message.

With so many fonts available today, whether installed by you or automatically by software programs, it can be daunting figuring out how to manage them. Too many, and your computer either behaves erratically or slows down altogether.
 
In Windows 10, though, there are new ways to install and manage fonts on your computer. It’s possible to download new ones, view or hide the current ones, and even delete those you never use.
 
## Best Places to Get Free or Premium Fonts
 
If you need a font for your creative project – whether it’s a blog, poster or branding project – there are a variety of sources with good fonts. However, not everyone can afford licenses for popular paid fonts, which is why you have the choice between free or premium fonts.
 
Some of the popular, reputable, free font sites include Google Fonts, which has one of the biggest Web-ready font collections with over 900 different font families. Fonts.com (integrated with SkyFonts) and FontBundles (curates font bundles) are other good sources for a variety of free fonts.
 
If you prefer to purchase fonts instead, you can check with reputable sites such as Linotype, which sells an enormous selection of quality fonts singularly and in family packs. You can also check FontShop run by Monotype that also has a free font selection plus a premium section where you can make a selection by category, designer or foundry.
 
## How to Know Which Fonts Are Available on Your PC
 
Windows 10 offers a few tools that can help you know which fonts are available on your computer.
 
The standard Fonts tool in the Control Panel shows you the fonts installed on your computer. Not only that, but you can also view and print a preview of any of the fonts.
 
However, you can perform even more tricks with the Windows 10 April 2018 Update or higher via the Fonts screen.
 
You can see how each font looks without a preview, uninstall unwanted fonts and download more fonts from Microsoft. To do this:
 
1. Open Control Panel and select “Appearance and Personalization.”
 
2. Next, click Fonts.
 
3. Click Font settings.
 
### How to Install Fonts in Windows 10
 
If you want to install fonts through the drag-and-drop method, the Windows 10 May 2019 May update offers this option. You can go to “Settings -> System -> About” to check your Windows version.
 
To download the fonts you want, go to the Microsoft Store by doing the following:
 
1. Click “Start -> Settings -> Personalization.”
 
2. Next, click the “Get more fonts in Microsoft Store” link and go to the new Fonts section.
 
The Microsoft Store will open. From here you can see free and premium/paid fonts, which you can install just as you would a game or app from the Store. Click on Font and click the blue Get button to download to your computer.
 
Windows will install the fonts for the languages used. For instance, if your Windows version is in English, you’ll see the fonts for the Latin character set only. If you want fonts for different languages, go to the Fonts screen and click “Download fonts for all languages” on the upper right.
 
Note: before installing fonts, make sure you really need them and have space on your hard drive because they take up quite a chunk of your space.
 
### How to Manage Fonts in Windows 10
 
To manage the fonts you’ve installed in Windows 10, take the steps below:
 
1. Open “Windows Control Panel -> Appearance and Personalization.”
 
2. Select Fonts.
 
Here you can view your installed fonts, add new ones by dragging the font file into the font window, hide fonts or remove unwanted fonts by clicking the font and selecting Delete from the upper menu (except for System fonts).
 
If you no longer need a font and want to delete it, click the Fonts list followed by Uninstall. Windows comes with pre-installed fonts that work with the apps you install, so make sure you’re only uninstalling the fonts you installed and no longer need so that you don’t affect the proper display and functioning of installed apps. You can also right-click a font and select Delete to remove it.
 
You’ve now learned how to install and manage fonts on your Windows 10 PC. If you have other ways of doing this, or you’re having specific challenges with font installation and management, tell us in a comment below.
