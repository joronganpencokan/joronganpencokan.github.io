One of the most popular ways to look up characters in World of Warcraft is by using the Armory. This is a website that Blizzard (the company that makes WoW) maintains, and it allows you to search for any character and see their stats, gear, achievements, and even their mount and pet collections.

To use the Armory, all you need to do is go to the WoW website and click on the "Armory" tab. From there, you can enter the name of the character you want to look up and hit "enter." The Armory will then display all of the information it has on that character.

Another popular website for looking up characters in WoW is WoWHead. This site allows you to see a character's gear, talents, and more, as well as providing helpful guides for dungeons and raids.

To use WoWHead, simply go to the site and enter the name of the character you want to look up in the search bar on the main page. You can then view all of their information, including their gear, talents, and more.

If you're someone who plays WoW on your computer, you can also use add-ons to look up characters right from within the game. There are a number of add-ons available that allow you to easily search for any character and see their stats and gear.

One popular add-on for looking up characters is called "InspectFix." This add-on allows you to quickly view any character's gear and talents, and it can be easily installed with the Twitch app.
