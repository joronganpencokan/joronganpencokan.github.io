### How to Create a Custom Painting
 
Minecraft enables you to express your creativity in the form of your very own customized paintings. Stay tuned to check out our guide on how to create a custom painting in Minecraft.
 
#### Step 1: Creating a Resource Park
 
To create your own custom painting in Minecraft, you first need to create a resource pack. Resource packs help you modify textures, models, sounds, and many other elements in the game.
 
- To create a resource pack, head to the “resourcepacks” folder that is located within the “.minecraft” folder.
 - Once you’re here, create a new folder. You can give the folder any name according to your choice.
 - Once you’ve created your folder, create a text document within it and name it “pack.mcmeta”. Kindly check to ensure there are no errors in the name as the .mcmeta extension is essential to this process.
 - In the text document, enter the exact following words: { “pack”:{ “pack_format”:5, “description”:”Custom Paintings” }}
 - In the “Custom Paintings” section, you can choose to add the name f your folder.
 - Now that you have created a resource pack, you can find it by clicking “Options”, followed by “Resource Packs”. You should be able to view your custom resource pack on the left side.
 - Click on the triangular arrow on the icon of your resource pack to move it to the right side under “Selected Resource Packs”. Hitting the “Done” button will enable your resource to be loaded into the game.

 
#### Step 2:Finding Your New Painting
 
Creating a custom painting results in one of the 26 paintings in-game being replaced. It is thus important to decide the size of the painting you will overwrite. For example, if you decide to replace an image that has a size of 4×4, you will have to ensure your custom painting is in the 1:1 ratio.
 
When your image is finalized, you’ll need to save it in a specific manner. Your custom painting will have to bear the ID of the painting it replaces along with the extension .png.
 
#### Step 3: Saving Your Custom Image Into Your Resource Pack
 
- After you’re done creating your custom painting, you can then place it in your resource pack. To do this, you will need to create a series of folders.
 - In “Custom_Paintings” (the name of the folder depends on what you’ve named it) create a folder named “assets”.
 - Within this folder, create another folder called “textures”.
 - Create another folder called “painting” in the “textures” folder.
 - You will place your painting in this folder. If you followed all the steps mentioned above correctly, you should see your painting in-game when you create a painting of the same size.

 
It’s important to note that your painting will only be visible to you if you’re playing on a shared Minecraft Realm. Unless other gamers go through the same steps, they’d only be able to view the original “pointer”.
 
## How To Make a Secret Painting Doorway
