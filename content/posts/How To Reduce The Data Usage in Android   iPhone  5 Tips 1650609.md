# STOP OVERPAYING for Mobile Data! Save $$$ with these 5 Amazing Tips to Reduce Usage on Android and iPhone

Have you ever received a shocking monthly phone bill due to excessive data usage? Have you cursed yourself for not checking how much data you used on your Android or iPhone? Well, we understand your pain and are here to help you save some serious bucks. In this article, we present you with 5 amazing tips to reduce mobile data usage on Android and iPhone.

## 1. Check Your Data Usage Regularly

Before diving into how to reduce mobile data usage, it is vital to monitor your usage regularly. Most mobile carriers provide their customers with an app or login portal where they can check their data usage. Some phones also have built-in features that show you a breakdown of your mobile data usage. By keeping track of your usage, you can understand how much data you use and which apps consume the most. Once you have this knowledge, you can take action to reduce your data usage accordingly.

## 2. Connect to Wi-Fi Networks

One of the most effective ways to reduce mobile data usage is by connecting to Wi-Fi networks whenever possible. Wi-Fi networks are faster and more reliable than mobile networks, and most importantly, they are free. Therefore, whenever you have the option to connect to a Wi-Fi network, do so. You can save a lot of data and money by doing this.

## 3. Limit Background Data

Background data refers to the data consumed by your apps when they are not in use. Many apps use background data to fetch updates or perform other tasks that are not necessary when you are not using them. This can quickly consume a lot of mobile data, hence costing you money. To reduce background data usage, go to your phone's settings, select "Data usage," and then find the option for "Restrict app background data." By enabling this option, you can limit the amount of data apps use when they are not in use.

## 4. Use Data Compression

Many of the apps we use on our phones consume a lot of data due to high-quality graphics or large file sizes. However, you can save data by using data compression tools. Most mobile browsers have built-in data compression features, and you can also download apps like "Opera Max" or "Onavo Extend," which compress data on your behalf. These apps can significantly reduce the amount of data you consume when browsing the web or using apps.

## 5. Turn Off Mobile Data for Inactive Apps

Finally, another way to reduce mobile data usage is by turning off mobile data for apps that you are not using actively. Many apps continue to consume data even when they are running in the background. By turning off mobile data for inactive apps, you can save a lot of data and money. To do this, go to your phone's settings, select "Data usage," and then find the option for "Disable data usage for inactive apps." By enabling this option, your phone will turn off mobile data for apps that you are not using actively, hence reducing data usage.

In conclusion, mobile data overages can cost you a lot of money, but by following these tips, you can reduce your data usage and save some serious cash. By checking your usage regularly, connecting to Wi-Fi networks, limiting background data, using data compression, and turning off mobile data for inactive apps, you can reduce your data usage significantly. So, start implementing these tips today and start saving money on your mobile bill.

The user with limited data frequently checks the remaining data to avoid deducting money from the principal balance.

 
## Here is How To Reduce Data Usage in Android and iPhone


However, the users using an internet scheme with no limits, or we can say their data is unlimited, don’t need to care about the data usage, or in some cases, the internet won’t work after the user surpasses the data limit. So, we have listed some ways to help you save valuable mobile data.

 
### 1. Use WiFi Everywhere


It would help if you tried to use WiFi at the office, home, or anywhere possible; it will help you to switch from mobile data to WiFi. It will result in saving your data. It is widely recommended to use WiFi to save data. Many mobile network providers offer WiFi hotspots, which you can use when you are outside, and get benefits by using them.

 
### 2. Set Data Alerts and Limits


With Android and iOS devices, you can find out how much data you have used, and it may prove useful only if you check your average use. It will be better to set a reminder after the specified data limit.
On Android, you can set alerts and limits by heading to Settings > Wireless & Networks and then selecting Data Usage to check the amount of data you have used. You can also set a data limit; it will send you an alert after the data limit is exceeded, depending on your limit.
On iPhone, you can check the data usage by heading to Settings > Mobile Data and then scrolling down to the bottom to trigger Reset Statistics. So, to reset the stats for each month, you will need to set them individually via the Reminders App.

 
### 3. Limit The Background Data


This is also the main reason beyond the data draining, which is background syncing. Like when the Facebook App receives an update, your device checks to find where there is any new email on your server. Limiting it will save not only your data but also your battery.
For one Android, head to Settings > Wireless and Networks > Data Usage and then click on the app to look for “Restrict app background data“.
On your iPhone, head to Settings > Mobile Data, and then you will see the list of apps using your mobile data, so switch off the apps you find unnecessary.

 
### 4. Disable Background App Refresh on iPhone


However, iPhone users can only use this feature by completely switching off the background app refresh by heading to Settings > General and scrolling down until they see Background App refresh, so switch off the Background App Refresh to avoid refreshing apps in the background.

 
### 5. Compress your data


There is an app, namely Onavo Extend, which is available to both Android and iOS. It is meant to compress the data and increase your data plan up to five times. However, it doesn’t work with streaming music or video apps.
Also, it won’t work with VOIP apps. However, it will reduce the data consumed by loading images and text. It is available for free on both major operating systems.
So, these ways above will help you save your data in case you have limited data. Watching videos online is another reason behind the data draining, so avoid watching videos if you have limited mobile internet data. We hope you will like these tips; kindly share this with your friends.
