Is Your Amazon Package Infected with Coronavirus? Learn How to Keep Your Family Safe with These Sanitization Tips!

With the ongoing pandemic, people have been relying more on online shopping, and Amazon has become one of the most preferred e-commerce platforms. While it's convenient to get essential items delivered right to our doorstep, there's still the concern of the virus spreading through packages. As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus can survive on surfaces like cardboard for up to 24 hours. Hence, it becomes crucial to take necessary precautions to avoid contracting the virus.

If you're an Amazon shopaholic, here are some sanitization tips to keep your family safe:

1. Sanitize the package before bringing it inside

The first line of defense is to sanitize the package before bringing it inside. You may use disinfectant sprays or wipes to clean the package thoroughly. Be careful while wiping electronic items, as they may not be compatible with certain cleaning solutions.

2. Wash your hands after handling the package

After sanitizing the package, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use a hand sanitizer if there's no access to soap and water. Avoid touching your face during the sanitization process.

3. Quarantine the package

Once you have sanitized and washed your hands, place the package in a quarantined area or a separate room that you don't frequently use. Leave it untouched for at least 24 hours before unboxing it. If the product is perishable or you need it urgently, you may sanitize it once again before using.

4. Disinfect the contents of the package

Use disinfectant wipes or sprays to clean the contents of the package before using them. For example, if you ordered groceries, wipe the packaging of the items before storing them in the pantry or fridge.

5. Dispose of the packaging safely

Dispose of the packaging safely by wrapping it in a plastic bag and sealing it tightly. Avoid direct contact with the bag while disposing of it.

Conclusion

These sanitization tips can help you keep your family safe from the coronavirus while receiving orders from Amazon. Don't hesitate to take necessary precautions, as the virus can survive on surfaces for a long time. Ensure that everyone in your household is following these guidelines to prevent the virus from spreading. Stay safe and happy shopping!


But a new study released by the National Institutes of Health shows online orders aren’t 100% risk-free. Is it safe to handle mail and packages? The coronavirus is capable of sticking to surfaces for up to three days, which makes disinfecting extremely important. Tap or click to see the best disinfectants you can use, according to the EPA.

 
## What’s going on?


The National Institutes of Health reports the SARS-COV2 virus that causes COVID-19 is capable of clinging to surfaces for a longer period of time than originally thought. The virus can be found in aerosol particles for up to three hours, can cling to cardboard for up to 24 hours and can stick to plastic and stainless steel for up to three days, according to the New England Journal of Medicine.
Previously, researchers assumed respiratory droplets were the primary vector of infection. But this new knowledge, as well as the fact that infected people can display no symptoms at all, shows there is so much more we can do to protect ourselves and our loved ones.

It also presents a new set of challenges for one of the most important services we’ve come to rely on: delivery. Luckily, there are steps you can take to make sure the packages you receive are safe enough to bring indoors. Tap or click to see some of the coronavirus-killing items you can order online.

 
## Get serious about sanitizing


Once three hours have passed, you’ve reduced the chance of contacting any aerosol particles from the delivery person. 
Second, you’ll want to assess what kind of package you’re dealing with. If you receive a cardboard box, you should handle it with gloves (if possible) and place it in a safe, secure outdoor location — like a backyard, patio or balcony — for 24 hours. If it’s a plastic package or bag, you’ll want to leave it in your secure location for up to three days.
When you’re done, wash up. Hand sanitizer is fine if you’re on the go, but you really need to wash thoroughly with soap and water.
After a day, put on a fresh pair of gloves and wipe down the box or bag. If you have disinfecting wipes on hand, use them. If you don’t, a paper towel moistened in 70% isopropyl alcohol will do the trick. You can use 90% alcohol, too, but you need to dilute it.
Give the items in your box a wipedown, too. Throw out all the packaging, gloves and whatever you used to disinfect, then wash your hands again. Now your order is ready to come inside.

## No time to waste


Not everyone can afford to wait a few days for supplies. Some items, like grocery deliveries, must be opened right away. This is where you need to proceed with caution. If you treat your package carefully, you can open it safely. Here’s how:

 
Just like with non-perishables, put on gloves and wipe down the box with a disinfectant wipe. Remove the contents and leave the box or packaging outside. Any outer packaging should be removed and thrown directly into the trash before storing perishables in your fridge. Thoroughly wash any fresh fruits or veggies with soapy water, and rinse thoroughly.


Once you’re finished, avoid touching or interacting with family members and wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm-to-hot water for 20 seconds. This will kill any traces of virus left on your hands. Tap or click to see some of the other things you should sanitize aside from your hands.
These steps may seem extreme, but following these guidelines is a surefire way to stifle infection. We need to be vigilant in preventing the transmission of the virus, and the more people who put the effort into doing so, the safer the general population will be from disease.
Just like during the World wars, this is a time where every American has a duty to help themselves and their neighbors. Only this time, we’re not filing into factories and laboring to make shells. All we need to do is stay clean and remain indoors. That’s not too difficult, right?
