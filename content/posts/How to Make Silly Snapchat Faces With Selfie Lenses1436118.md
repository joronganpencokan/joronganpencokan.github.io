##   What Are Snapchat Lenses?  
 

The Snapchat Lens feature applies animated filter effects to your face when you hold up a front-facing camera to take a selfie. Using face-detecting technology, the app automatically finds your facial features, like your eyes and mouth, to apply the effects properly.

Filters can distort your face so that you have small eyes and a big mouth. Filters can give you a wig and makeup, like eyeshadow and lipstick, or make you look like a dog with a tongue that appears when you open your mouth.

 

When you browse through the available lenses, you should come across some that let you bring a friend in so you can both share the lens. These lenses detect two faces at once.

 

Snapchat now has lenses that work with your dog or cat. Look for the lenses that display a paw print icon.
