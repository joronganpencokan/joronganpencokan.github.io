# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Create A Stunning Website Using Word For Mac!

If you're one of the millions of Mac users out there, you've likely heard of Microsoft Word. It's a popular word processing and document creation tool that's been around for decades. But did you know that Word for Mac can also help you create a stunning website?

That's right! Word for Mac comes with a built-in feature called Web Layout, which lets you create web pages just like you would create a document. Here's how you can use Word for Mac to create a stunning website.

## Step 1: Open Word For Mac

The first step, of course, is to open Word for Mac. Once you've done that, you'll need to select "New Document" from the "File" menu. This will open a new blank document, which you can use to start creating your website.

## Step 2: Get Familiar With The Web Layout View

Once you have a new document open, you'll need to switch to Web Layout view. To do this, click on the "View" menu and select "Web Layout." This will change the view of your document to a web page format, with rulers, margins, and other web-specific settings.

## Step 3: Add Content To Your Website

Now that you're in Web Layout view, it's time to start adding content to your website. You can add text, images, and even tables, just like you would in a regular Word document.

One important tip when creating a website in Word: be sure to select the right font and font size for your website. Avoid using fancy or difficult-to-read fonts, as these can make your website hard to read and unprofessional-looking.

## Step 4: Add Links To Your Website

One of the essential features of a website is its ability to link to other pages and websites. Word for Mac makes it easy to add links to your website.

To add a link, select the text or image you want to use as your link, and then click on the "Insert" menu. Select "Hyperlink," and you'll be prompted to add the URL of the page or site you want to link to.

## Step 5: Save Your Website

Once you've finished creating your website, it's essential to save it to your computer. To do this, click on the "File" menu and select "Save As." Choose a name for your website and select a location on your computer to save it.

Congratulations! You've just created a stunning website using Word for Mac!

In conclusion, Word for Mac is a powerful tool that can help you create a website quickly and easily. With its built-in Web Layout feature, you can create web pages just like you would create a document, adding text, links, and images to create a stunning website. So, why not try creating a website using Word for Mac today? You won't believe how easy it is!

There are a lot of basic HTML editors out there for your Mac. Many of them can even be downloaded and used for an indefinite span of time at no cost to you at all. No one is going to deny that fact. The real question is, do you actually need to download one of them at all?
 
If your needs are basic, and you have Word already installed on your Mac, then you do not need to download anything at all. Even if you have never used Word as a web editor in the past, it does have that feature and you can use it to save yourself some hard drive space. This is especially good news if you have an older Mac laptop that is short on space.

No matter what your reason for using Word on your Mac is, the process will be roughly the same. If you want to move on, just follow these simple steps and you will have a basic HTML site ready and waiting to be uploaded to whatever server you are using to host your site. You will even be able to add new code for your favorite widgets or social media site badges once the site is up and running, without having to alter your Word document again.
 
Step 1: 
 
Open your Word document the same way that you normally would for a standard document. You can do this by double clicking on the icon on your dock. If you can’t find it in the dock, go to the Applications folder in the Finder. Depending on the age of your machine it may take some time to load. 
 
Step Two: 
 
Right now you are in your document  view, which is good for a variety of things. However, the web view will give you a much more accurate look at how the project will actually look when it is on the web. To switch to web view, simply click on “View -> Web Layout”. 
 

 
Now we can move onto creating the look and the content of your new site.
 
Step Three:
 
This is the body of your work.  Here is where you add your text and images. Make any changes to the size of the text, the color of the text or background. Be sure to get things exactly the way that you want them, though that may require a little bit of tweaking in the formatting department. Just be sure to make good use of your formatting pallet and you should have no problems getting the effects that you want to see.
 
Step Four:
 
If there was a tricky part, this would be it. In reality this part is simple too.
 
Choose file, and then “save as”.
 
Give your new website document a unique name and save it in the place where you can find it easily. In the pull down box for file formats, choose a Web Page (.htm) for your file type. Once you have chosen the correct file type, you can go ahead and save as you normally would, by clicking on the “save” button.
 
Now, you can upload your HTML file, wherever you need to. Enjoy your site.
