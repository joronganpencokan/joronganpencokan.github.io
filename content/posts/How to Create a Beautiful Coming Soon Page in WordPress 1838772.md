Introduction

It is essential to create a lasting impression on website visitors when launching a new website. One of the best ways to achieve this is by designing a compelling "coming soon" page. A "coming soon" page not only helps to build anticipation but also to deliver important information to your visitors while your website is still in development. WordPress, with its vast range of plugins and customization options, provides an excellent platform to create stunning "coming soon" pages. In this article, we will discuss how to create a stunning "coming soon" page in WordPress.

Step 1: Choose a coming soon page plugin

The first thing you need to do is to choose a WordPress coming soon page plugin that best suits your requirements. Some popular options include SeedProd, EZP Coming Soon Page, Coming Soon & Maintenance Mode Plugin for WordPress by WPBeginner, and many others. Once you've chosen a plugin, install and activate it on your WordPress website.

Step 2: Customize your coming soon page

Now that you've installed the plugin, you can customize your coming soon page with ease. Most plugins come with an intuitive drag-and-drop builder that allows you to easily customize all aspects of the page, including fonts, colors, images, and more. You can add a countdown timer, social media links, and subscription forms to your page to build your email list before your website launch.

Step 3: Add relevant information

Your coming soon page should provide relevant information to your visitors about your website's launch, what they can expect, and who you are. Be sure to include a short introduction, a brief overview of your website's purpose and goals, and contact information. You can also include links to your social media profiles and important pages on your website.

Step 4: Optimize your coming soon page for search engines

It's essential to optimize your coming soon page for search engines so that your website can quickly gain traffic once it's launched. Add relevant keywords to the page title, meta description, and content. Include a link to your website's sitemap in the footer of your page to help search engine crawlers index your website.

Step 5: Test and publish

Before publishing your coming soon page, it's important to test it and ensure that it's working correctly. Check that all links are working and that your subscription forms are set up correctly. Once you've tested it, you can publish your coming soon page and start building anticipation for your website launch.

Conclusion

Creating a stunning "coming soon" page in WordPress is easy with the right plugin and customization options available. Be sure to provide relevant information, optimize it for search engines, and test before publishing. A well-designed "coming soon" page can help to build anticipation, generate leads, and create a lasting impression on your website visitors.

Many websites use a coming soon page to create some momentum before launching the site. If you are about to launch a site but are not ready yet, here is how you can create a beautiful “Coming Soon” page in WordPress.
 
First, you should know there are dozens of “Coming Soon” and “Maintenance Mode” plugins, and quite naturally they offer different options. For the purposes of this tutorial, I chose the Easy Coming Soon plugin because of its straightforwardness and simplicity.
 
There are other plugins, such as Coming Soon Page & Maintenance Mode by SeedProd with more features (and more installs), but I wanted something simple and easy. Nevertheless, the basic steps of creating a “Coming Soon” page should be more or less similar, no matter which plugin you pick.
 
## Download and Install the Easy Coming Soon Plugin
 
Go to your admin dashboard and navigate to “Plugins -> Add New.” Either upload the plugin files you’ve already downloaded or use the search box to find the “Easy Coming Soon” plugin. Install and activate the plugin. When you open it, you will see its General Settings page.
 

 
## Enter Your General Data
 
The first setting is Status. You can enable it last after you are done with anything else or enable it right now so that you can see the changes immediately after you make them (though you can get a preview with the Live Preview option, too).
 
Proceed to entering the Headline, Description, Google Analytics code, and your Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ URLs, if you have any. None of these fields are mandatory, so you can skip the ones you don’t want to enter. When done, click Save.
 
Even if you stop with the general settings, you have a fully functioning Coming Soon page, but maybe you will want to make it a bit fancier. You can do this from the Design, Templates, and Pro Features (if you have purchased the Pro version) pages.
 
## Modify the Design of the Page
 
The Design Settings page allows you to set background color, Headline/Description Font Color, Size, and Style, as well as Background Noise Effect.
 
I opted to go with the default settings because they are nice, but you can modify anything you need. When done, click Save. You can go to the Live Preview page or open the homepage of your site in a browser to see what you’ve done so far.
 
## Enable Notifications
 
While you don’t have to do it, it won’t hurt to enable notifications. Notifications allow visitors to subscribe to your site. This is handy because when you finally launch it, you already have a mailing list of interested users. Enable notifications from the Notification Form Settings Page.
 
Enter your email address and the other data you deem fit and click Save Options. You are basically done creating your coming soon page.
 
## Test Your Coming Soon Page
 
You are not officially done until you test your Coming Soon page. You might have to try it in a different browser – i.e. not the one you are logged in as admin because for me this didn’t work (with Firefox on Linux). Here is how the page looks for me:
 
With the right plugin it is easy to create a minimal coming soon page in five minutes or less. I wanted to keep it really minimal – no fancy stuff – just the Coming Soon info and an email field to collect the email addresses of potential subscribers, but if you have more data you want to collect, you can add it. Just don’t add too much because this will clutter the page, and your important info will get lost!
