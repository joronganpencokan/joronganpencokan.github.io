# Revolutionary tech alert: Google's Brillo set to overthrow Windows 10 IoT in IoT battle

The Internet of Things (IoT) has become a buzzword in the tech world. From smart homes to connected cars, the potential for IoT is unlimited. Windows 10 IoT has been a popular operating system choice for IoT devices, but that may soon change with the arrival of Google's Brillo.

Brillo is a stripped-down version of the Android operating system designed specifically for IoT devices. It is lightweight, fast, and secure, making it a strong contender in the IoT market. Brillo supports a wide range of hardware, making it suitable for a variety of devices, from light bulbs to refrigerators.

Compared to Windows 10 IoT, Brillo has several advantages. First and foremost, it is backed by Google, which is one of the most influential companies in the tech industry. Google has a proven track record in developing new technologies and is known for its innovation. Brillo is also open-source, which means that developers can modify and improve it to suit their needs.

Another feature that sets Brillo apart from Windows 10 IoT is its security. Google has made security a top priority in Brillo, and it comes with several security features, including secure boot, secure updates, and Google's Secure Element, which encrypts data at rest and in transit.

One of the biggest advantages of Brillo is its integration with Google's services. Brillo is compatible with Google's cloud platform, which allows developers to create and manage IoT devices remotely. It also integrates seamlessly with Google's voice-activated assistant, Google Assistant, which opens up new possibilities for IoT devices.

However, Windows 10 IoT is not without its advantages. It offers more flexibility in terms of software development, and it has a larger developer community. It also offers a wider range of tools for developing IoT applications.

In conclusion, Google's Brillo is a strong competitor to Windows 10 IoT in the IoT market. Its lightweight and fast design, strong security features, and integration with Google's services make it an attractive option for developers. However, it remains to be seen whether it will be able to overtake Windows 10 IoT, which has established itself as a leading operating system in the IoT market. Ultimately, the choice between Brillo and Windows 10 IoT will depend on the needs of developers and the requirements of their IoT devices.

Microsoft is gearing up to roll out Windows 10 on every device possible, even for those new IoT (Internet of Things) devices, which are small, low in tech specs, and very inexpensive. However, Microsoft isnâ€™t the only one building a small footprint operating system, Google will soon get in the same market.
 
A new report from The Information claims that Google is developing a new IoT operating system called Brillo, and the search giant is expected to unveil the new software during the I/O developer conference later this month.
 
While there is not much details about the features or how the software will look like, because we know is an IoT operating system, we can assume Brillo is an optimized piece of software for hardware with very low resources and low RAM.
 
Google I/O will be happening on May 28, and we might just hear more about the new operating system during the conference, where the company is also expected to unveil major updates coming to Android OS and various other things.
