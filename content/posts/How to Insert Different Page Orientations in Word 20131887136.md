Are you tired of struggling with different page orientations in your Word 2013 documents? Do you find it frustrating to switch between portrait and landscape formats within the same document? If so, worry no more because we have a simple yet effective trick to revolutionize your Word 2013 documents!

First, let's understand why you may need different page orientations in the same document. For instance, you may be creating a report that has tables, charts, or images that are better suited to a landscape format. However, the bulk of your content, including headings and paragraphs, should be in portrait format for readability purposes.

To achieve this, follow these simple steps:

Step 1: Insert a Page Break

Select the page you wish to change orientation by placing the cursor on the last line of that page.

Next, navigate to the 'Page Layout' tab and select 'Breaks' and then 'Next page' from the options. This step will insert a page break and your cursor will move to the next page.

Step 2: Change Page Orientation

Double-click on the new page to open the Page Setup dialogue box. On the 'Margins' tab, select the orientation you want (either landscape or portrait) and click 'OK' to apply the changes.

Step 3: Repeat as Necessary

If you require multiple pages with different orientations, repeat the above steps for each page you want to change.

Voila! You've successfully created a Word 2013 document with different page orientations.

Benefits of Using This Trick

The primary benefit of using this trick is that it makes your document more visually appealing and improves its readability. You can use different page orientations to break up large blocks of text and make your document more interesting and engaging to read.

Furthermore, using different page orientations can help you save space when printing. For instance, images, charts, and tables that span the entire width of a page can be better presented in landscape format since there is more room to display information.

Conclusion

In conclusion, using different page orientations in Word 2013 documents is a simple trick that can revolutionize your documents. It makes them visually appealing and more readable while saving space when printing. With this knowledge, you can create professional-looking reports, manuals, and other documents that stand out from the rest.

This article explains how to use different orientations in your Microsoft Word 2013 documents. Portrait is a vertical layout and landscape is a horizontal layout. By default, Word opens in portrait orientation, but you may want part of the document to appear in landscape orientation or vice versa.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Insert a Section Break at the beginning of where you want a different orientation: Go to Page Layout > Breaks > Next Page.Then, go to the Page Setup Launcher, click Portrait or Landscape, then click Apply to > Selected text > OK. Or, let MS Word insert section breaks: Click Page Layout Launcher, select Portrait or Landscape, click Selected Text > OK.

 
##   Insert Section Breaks and Set the Orientation  
 

Set the breaks first and then set the orientation. In this method, you don't let WordÂ decide where the breaks fall. In order to accomplish this, insert a Next Page Section Break at the start and end of the text, table, picture, or another object, and then set the orientation.

 

Insert a Section Break at the beginning of the area that you want to have a different orientation:

 
- Select the Page Layout tab.Click the Breaks drop-down menu in the Page Setup section.Select Next Page in the Section Breaks section.Move to the end of the section and repeat the above steps to set a section break at the end of the material that will appear in an alternate orientation.Click the Page Setup Launcher button on the Page Layout tab in the Page Setup group.Click Portrait or Landscape on the Margins tab in the Orientation section.Select Section in the Apply To drop-down list.Click the OK button.

 
##   Let Word Insert Section Breaks and Set the Orientation  
 

By letting Microsoft Word 2013 insert section breaks, you save mouse clicks, but you have no idea where Word is going to place the section breaks.

 

The main problem with letting Microsoft Word place the section breaks is if you miss-select your text. If you do not highlight the entire paragraph, multiple paragraphs, images, table, or other items, Microsoft Word moves the unselected items onto another page. So if you decide to go this route, be careful when selecting the items you want. Select the text, pages, images, or paragraphs that you want to change to portrait or landscape orientation.

 
- Carefully highlight all the material you want to appear on a page or pages with a different orientation from the rest of the document.Click the Page Layout Launcher button on the Page Layout tab in the Page Setup group.Click Portrait or Landscape on the Margins tab in the Orientation section.Select Selected Text in the Apply To drop-down list.Click the OK button.
