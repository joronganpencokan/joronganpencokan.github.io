# Breaking News: Ultimate Guide to Mass-Releasing Pokemon in Legends Arceus Unveiled!

In a recent announcement by Nintendo, it has been revealed that the upcoming game, Legends Arceus, will have a unique feature that will allow players to release multiple Pokemon at once. This feature will give players the ability to manage their Pokemon collection more efficiently, and it will be a massive relief for all Pokemon trainers out there.

But what is the mass-releasing feature, and how does it work? Let us have a closer look.

## What is Mass-Releasing?

Mass-releasing is a feature that will allow players to select multiple Pokemon and release them simultaneously. This feature is mainly designed for players looking to declutter their Pokemon collection, as players usually collect a vast number of Pokemon during their adventures, and not all of them are useful.

## How to Mass-Release Pokemon

Mass-releasing Pokemon in Legends Arceus is relatively straightforward. You only need to follow the below steps:

1. Select the "Pokemon" option from the main menu.

2. From the list of Pokemon, you can either select individual Pokemon, or you can select multiple Pokemon by holding down the "ZL" button.

3. Select "Release" from the options.

4. A confirmation menu will appear, where you can either confirm or cancel the process.

Once you've confirmed the mass-release, the selected Pokemon will be released, and they will be permanently removed from your collection.

## Benefits of Mass-Releasing

Mass-releasing is an excellent way for Pokemon trainers to keep their collection organized and efficient. By removing unwanted Pokemon from their collection, trainers can have an overview of the Pokemon they have available and ensure that they have only the most useful Pokemon in their party.

Moreover, mass-releasing will free up valuable storage space in the player's PC boxes. Pokemon trainers usually end up collecting a lot of Pokemon that they do not use, and this can quickly fill up their storage boxes.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the mass-releasing feature in Legends Arceus is a significant addition to the game's mechanics. This feature will give players an easy way to manage their Pokemon collection, declutter their storage boxes, and ensure that they have only the most useful Pokemon available for battles.

Legends Arceus is set to release worldwide on January 28, 2022, for the Nintendo Switch. With the mass-release feature, players can expect to have a more streamlined Pokemon adventure, and we cannot wait to see what other exciting features the game has in store for us.
