# Revamp Your Phone's Performance with This Easy Trick to Update Apps on Google Play Store!

As technology evolves day by day, it is becoming more and more essential to have an updated smartphone to keep up with the latest trends, features, and optimization. Apps that are our daily driving force for communication, entertainment, productivity, and other tasks require frequent updates to ensure that they function with the latest bug fixes, security patches, and performance enhancements. 

Keeping your smartphone up to date with the latest app updates can significantly improve your phone's performance and its overall experience. If you are experiencing sluggish performance, app crashes, or any other problem, it might be time to update your apps in the Google Play Store. Here's how you can revamp your phone's performance with just a few simple steps to update apps on the Google Play Store.

## Step 1: Open the Google Play Store

Open the Google Play Store that is pre-installed on your smartphone. You can easily access it by tapping on its icon located on the home screen of your phone.

## Step 2: Navigate to My Apps & Games Option

Once you are in the Google Play Store, you will see several tabs on the bottom of the screen. Tap on the "My Apps & Games" option located on the right side of the screen. This will directly take you to your installed apps, and a list of all available app updates will appear.

## Step 3: Select Update All or Update Individual Apps

You will see all the available updates for your installed apps displayed on the screen. You can either choose to update all apps at once by clicking on the "Update All" option, or you can select individual apps to update by tapping on the "Update" option right next to the app name.

## Step 4: Wait for the Updates to Install

After selecting the apps to update, click on the update button, and wait for the update process to complete. Sometimes, it may take some time for the download to finish, depending on the app size and internet speed. So, it's always better to update your apps while connected to a stable Wi-Fi connection.

## Step 5: Restart Your Phone After Updating Apps

After the apps have been updated, it's always a good practice to restart your phone to ensure the new updates have been fully integrated. This will help optimize your phone's performance and ensure that any updates that were not previously running get started without any issues.

By following these simple steps, you can easily update your apps and give your smartphone a boost in its performance. Regularly updating your apps can help prevent security vulnerabilities, improve features, and optimize performance that can make your smartphone experience smoother and more enjoyable. 

In conclusion, keeping your phone's apps up-to-date is an easy and effective way to keep your phone's performance at its best. So why wait to revamp your phone's performance when you can update it today and enjoy optimized performance and improved functionality?

Getting bored or annoyed by the auto-update option of apps from the Google Play, you might have turned it off. (If you are feeling so and have not done it yet, see our article on :How to disable auto-update of apps from the Google Play Store?). After disabling the auto-update of apps from the Google Play Store, no apps by any chance will update themselves, but still, the Play Store will check for the updates all the time, and give you the notification for the same. From this, you can see the list of apps that are ready to be updated, and you can choose whether to update them or not.
 

 
To manually update the apps from the Google Play Store, you can follow the following simple steps:
 
- Click on the Notification that you have got (which says that the apps are ready for update, and asks you to click on the notification to update them).
 - After you click on that, you will be redirected to the Google Play Store app, where you will see the lists of all the apps, which you have installed in you device, under the ‘Installed’ category under the ‘My Apps’.
 - There, the apps which are ready for update will appear on the top, followed by the recently updated apps. The apps which haven’t been updated for a long time, and haven’t got any updates either, will show up on the bottom.
 - If you want a single app, or some particular apps to be updated, click on them individually, and then click on ‘Update’. Accept the terms and conditions, and then your desired app will be updated itself. If you want to update the whole bunch of apps (which have got the update) at once, click on ‘Update all’.

 
This method comes handy, when you have a limited data connection, and can not update all your apps at once (because of which you have disabled the auto-update of apps).
