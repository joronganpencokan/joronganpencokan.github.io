Title: You Won't Believe Which iTunes Features Actually Work on Your Android Phone!

Do you own an Android phone and feel left out because most of your friends use an iPhone? Have you ever wondered if you can access iTunes features on your Android device? Good news - you can! In this article, we'll introduce you to some iTunes features that work on Android phones.

1. Apple Music 

If you subscribe to Apple Music, you don't need an iPhone to access it. You can download the Apple Music app from the Google Play Store and start enjoying your favorite songs, playlists, and podcasts. The app has a clean and intuitive interface with the same features as the iOS version. You can also listen to Apple Music on your computer or other compatible devices.

2. iTunes Store

Did you know you can access the iTunes Store from your Android phone? Yes, you read that right! The iTunes Store is home to a vast collection of music, movies, TV shows, audiobooks, and podcasts. You can purchase, rent or download them directly on your Android device. The purchase will sync across all your devices, including your computer and iOS devices if you have them.

3. iCloud Music Library

iCloud Music Library is a cloud-based service that syncs your music library across all your devices. You can use it to upload music you've bought from other services or CDs to your iCloud Music Library and access them on your Android phone. To set up iCloud Music Library, go to Settings > Music > iCloud Music Library on your iOS device or iTunes on your computer. Then, log in with your Apple ID and turn on iCloud Music Library. Once it's turned on, your music library will be available on your Android phone.

4. AirPlay 2

AirPlay 2 is a wireless streaming protocol that allows you to stream audio and video from an iOS device to an Apple TV or AirPlay-enabled speaker. But did you know it also works on select Android devices? Some TVs and speakers come with built-in AirPlay 2 support or can be upgraded with firmware updates. To use AirPlay 2 on your Android phone, look for the AirPlay icon in the app you want to stream from and select the device you want to stream to.

Conclusion

We hope this article has shown you that being an Android user doesn't mean you have to miss out on iTunes features. With the Apple Music app, iTunes Store, iCloud Music Library, and AirPlay 2, you can enjoy high-quality music and video content on your Android phone just like an iPhone user. So, go ahead and explore these features and let us know your favorite one in the comments below!

Deciding to buy an Android device rather than an iPhone doesn't mean you have to turn your back on the tremendous selection of music, movies, and other great media available in iTunes. Whether it's music or movies, apps, or the iTunes program itself, some Android users may want to use iTunes, or at least get its content. But when it comes to iTunes and Android, what works and what doesn't?

 
##   Playing iTunes Music on Android: Yes  
 

Music downloaded from iTunes is compatible with Android phones in most cases. Music purchased from iTunes is in the AAC format, which Android has built-in support for.

 
The information in this article should apply no matter who made your Android phone. Whether you've got a phone from Samsung, Google, Huawei, Xiaomi, or any of the many other Android makers, these tips apply.
 

The exception to this ​is songs bought from iTunes prior to the April 2009 introduction of the DRM-free iTunes Plus format. These files, which use the Protected AAC format, won't work on Android because it doesn't support iTunes' digital rights management (DRM). However, you can upgrade these songs to Android-compatible AAC files.

 
##   Playing Apple Music on Android: Yes  
 

If you're looking for iTunes for Android in order to get access to all the music from the iTunes Store, you're in luck. Apple Music runs on Android, too. That means you get unlimited access to the tens of millions of songs in Apple Music.

 

The Apple Music streaming service is notable because it represents Apple's first major Android app. In the past, Apple only made iOS apps. Apple Music replaces the Beats Music service and app, though, and that ran on Android. Because of that, Apple Music is available to Android users, too. Download the app to get a free trial. Subscriptions for Android users cost the same as for iPhone users.

 
##   Playing Podcasts From iTunes on Android: Sort Of  
 

Podcasts are just MP3s, and Android devices can all play MP3s, so compatibility isn't an issue. But with no iTunes or Apple Podcasts app for Android, the question is: why would you try to use iTunes to get podcasts for your Android?

 

Google Play, Spotify, and Stitcher, all apps that run on Android, have sizeable podcast libraries. Technically you could download podcasts from iTunes and sync them to your Android, or find a third-party podcast app that lets you subscribe to iTunes for downloads, but it's probably simpler to just use one of those apps.

 
##   Playing iTunes Videos on Android: No  
 

All movies and TV shows rented or bought from iTunes have digital rights management restrictions. Because Android doesn't support Apple's iTunes DRM, videos rented or bought from iTunes won't work on Android. On the other hand, some other kinds of video stored in an iTunes library, such as that recorded using the camera on an iPhone, are compatible with Android.

If you get software to remove DRM or that does that as part of converting an iTunes video file to another format, you should be able to create an Android-compatible file. The legality of those approaches is questionable, though.

 
##   Running iPhone Apps on Android: No  
 

Alas, iPhone apps don't run on Android. With the huge library of compelling apps and games at the App Store, some Android users might wish they could use iPhone apps, but just like the Mac version of a program won't run on Windows, iOS apps can't run on Android. The Google Play store for Android does offer well over 1 million apps, and many of them have both Android and iOS versions.

 
##   Reading Apple Books on Android: No

##   Syncing iTunes and Android: Yes  
 

One of the key things iTunes does for iOS devices is sync data between the device and a desktop computer. If you're looking for iTunes for Android in order to sync with your computer, you've got some options.

While iTunes won't sync media and other files to Android devices by default, with a little work and a third-party application, the two can talk to each other. Apps that can sync iTunes and Android include doubleTwist Sync from doubleTwist and iSyncr from JRT Studio.

 
##   AirPlay Streaming From Android: Yes  
 

Android devices can't stream media via Apple's wireless AirPlay software out of the box, but with add-on apps they can. If you're already using DoubleTwist's AirSync to sync your Android device and iTunes, an Android app adds AirPlay streaming. 

 
It's not part of iTunes, but there's another interesting cross-platform option for Android users. Believe it or not, if you want to use Apple's iMessage texting platform on Android, you can. Learn how in iMessage For Android: How to Get It And Use It.
