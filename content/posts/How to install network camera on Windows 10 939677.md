On Windows 10, you have been able to install network cameras for a long time, but it has not been an easy process. However, this has changed with the native support for network cameras with version 20H1, but with version 21H2, the installation becomes more effortless.
 
Unlike USB cameras, network cameras are devices that stream the data through the local area network (LAN) using a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) configuration. Usually the preferred choice for security and surveillance purposes.
 
Windows 10 supports discovery, pairing, configuring, and stream TCP/IP-enabled for major ONVIF Profile S compliant camera brands. As you connect new network cameras, the stream can be easily routed through the existing camera APIs, making it possible to capture images, stream, or record videos using the default Camera app or third-party solutions.
 
This guide will teach youÂ the steps to connect a network on Windows 10.
