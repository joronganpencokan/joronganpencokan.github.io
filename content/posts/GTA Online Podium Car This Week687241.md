Every Thursday, Rockstar Games provides its weekly update and players can look forward to getting new Podium Car, GTA$, and RP bonuses among others. While players can also look forward to the Prize Ride each week, many are excited about the top prize at the Diamond Casino. The GTA Online Podium Car changes every week with the weekly update and we will keep this guide updated with those. So if you are looking to spin the lucky wheel, we recommend you bookmark this guide for the weekly update of Podium Cars.
 
## What is the GTA Online Podium Car This Week? (5th January)
 
 
 
You can go down to Diamond Casino and spin the Lucky Wheel once every day. While getting the top prize is no guarantee, there are other exciting rewards and you might just get lucky. However, you will have to deposit 500 GTA$ & get the membership to be able to participate in the lucky wheel. Seems like a fair price since you can spin once every 24 hours.
 

 
For this weekly update, the GTA Online Podium Car is:
 
- HVY Insurgent (January 5 – January 12) – Can also purchase it from Legendary Motorsport for a price of 897,750 GTA$.

 
The top prize is often difficult to get so don’t be discouraged if you don’t make it every time. Other prizes available within the lucky wheel are rewarding enough to make up for it. Even though it is in-game money, we recommend there is no harm in taking the spin.
 
Along with the Podium Car, players can also go for the Prize Ride this week. And with the other prizes and discounts, the Weekly Update is a hit among players.
 
### What Time is GTA Online Weekly Update?
 
GTA Online Podium Car will reset at the end of the week with the Weekly Update. This will reset every week at:
 
- 10 AM GMT
 - 5 AM ET
 - 2 AM PT

 
That’s all there is on the GTA Online Podium Car this week. While you are here, check out our other GTA Online guides with Gamer Tweak.
