##   What Is Wi-Fi Calling?  
 

Wi-Fi Calling is a feature of iOS 8 and up that allows phone calls to be made using Wi-Fi networks instead of through a service provider's cellular towers. Wi-Fi Calling allows the calls to work like Voice over IP technology, which treats a voice call like any other data sent over a computer network.

 

Wi-Fi Calling is most useful for people in rural locations or buildings made of certain materials who don't get good cell reception at their homes or businesses. In these places, getting better reception is impossible until phone companies install new cell towers nearby. Without those towers, customers' only choices are to either switch phone companies or go without cell phone service in those important locations.
