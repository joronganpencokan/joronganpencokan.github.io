Are you tired of feeling like your social life is stagnant and lacking excitement? Do you find yourself struggling to come up with interesting conversation topics? Well, worry no more, because Amazon Alexa is here to revolutionize your social life!

That's right, the voice-activated assistant that can play your favorite songs and order your groceries can also transform your conversations with friends and family. Here's how:

## 1. Get to Know Your Alexa

Amazon Alexa is equipped with a wide range of knowledge and can answer almost any question you can think of. Take the time to ask Alexa a variety of questions and explore her capabilities. This way, when you're hanging out with friends, you can impress them with your Alexa expertise and share interesting facts.

## 2. Play Games

Amazon Alexa is great at entertaining guests with interactive games, like Jeopardy and Trivial Pursuit. Not only are these games guaranteed to liven up any gathering, but they'll also provide opportunities for laughs and bonding over friendly competition.

## 3. Showcase Music

One of the best ways to create a great atmosphere for your social gatherings is through music. You can ask Alexa to craft a playlist of your favorite songs or ask her to play the latest hits from your preferred music genre. Having Alexa serve as your DJ will help set the tone for a fun and lively night.

## 4. Spice Up Conversations

If you want to take your conversations to the next level, ask Alexa to tell you some jokes or interesting stories. You can even have her translate languages if you have international friends. Alexa can spice up any conversation with her jokes and knowledge, adding a unique twist to your socializing.

## 5. Redefine Linguistics

Alexa can also be a great tool for improving your linguistics and language skills. You can ask her to pronounce unfamiliar words or to teach you phrases in foreign languages. This can make for a great conversation starter and help you impress your foreign friends.

If you are out of practice talking to strangers about the weather, your smart home device can help give you some conversation confidence, but don't forget to practice on actual humans. 

 
### 
Key Takeaways
 

"For somebody who lacks confidence, this may give them a touch of confidence since they're being told skills that they can take out there, and I think that's a good thing," Debra Fine, a conversation expert and author of The Fine Art of Small Talk, told Lifewire in a phone interview. 

 
##   Small Talk With Alexa  
 

Fine said that since most of us have been using technology more to communicate over the past year, this Alexa skill could be a good stepping-stone into re-entering the world of in-person communications.

 
I think you will regain confidence one step at a time by just making yourself go to functions, parties, and family gatherings and earnestly investing time in conversing with people.
 

"A lot of people say they now have social anxiety about mixing with people again, whether it be at the water cooler and or at social events, weddings, etc., and that’s what this Alexa thing is all about: to give people that competence for when they have to go to a party or there's something for work," Fine said. 

 

Fine added that having a good conversation doesn’t have to be rocket science—if a smart home device can do it, so can you. 

 
##   Human Interaction Over Technology   
 

Even if you find talking to your smart home devices useful, Fine said one-to-one human interaction will always be better than technology, and warned you should be careful relying on smart home devices to replace real human skills. 

 

Fine explained that it’s up to each person in a conversation to make the other one feel comfortable, in addition to acting interested in what they have to say. 

 

"We were lazy before the pandemic, and now we're lazier than ever because we don't even have to answer [a question]," she said. "The only time I have to answer a question is when you use my name, but you don't even have to remember my name anymore with things like Zoom."

 

She said Alexa’s conversation tips are useful, but she has a few to add to keep in your back pocket during your next gathering, including being a good listener by giving verbal cues and playing the "conversation game."

 

"Always be prepared to answer 'How have you been?' or 'What’s new with you?' with a one-sentence response, and the other person can either play off that response or move on."

 

Overall, while Alexa’s latest skill is a neat feature, it’s still missing one thing: human interaction. If anything, Fine said to take whatever you learn from Alexa or your other smart devices and apply it to real-life situations. 

 

"I think you will regain confidence one step at a time by just making yourself go to functions, parties, and family gatherings and earnestly investing time in conversing with people," she said.
