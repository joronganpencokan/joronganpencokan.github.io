# Revolutionize Your Family's Digital Life Forever with This Genius Shared Library Hack!

As the modern world becomes increasingly digital, families are finding themselves surrounded by various digital devices, from smartphones and tablets to laptops and TVs. While this abundance of technology can bring many benefits, it can also create problems, especially when it comes to keeping track of important files, photos, and documents. Fortunately, with the help of a shared library hack, families can revolutionize their digital lives forever.

First of all, what exactly is a shared library? A shared library is a networked drive or a cloud storage service that allows multiple users to access and edit the same files simultaneously. By creating a shared library, families can consolidate their digital assets in one central location, making it easy to find and share information. Here's how to create a shared library and revolutionize your family's digital life forever.

## Step 1: Choose a Storage Service

The first step in creating a shared library is to choose a storage service that fits your family's needs. There are many cloud storage providers out there, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Microsoft OneDrive. Each service offers different amounts of free storage, paid plans, and unique features, so take the time to research and compare the options.

## Step 2: Create a Shared Folder

Once you have chosen a storage service, the next step is to create a shared folder. This folder will contain all the files, photos, and documents that your family wants to share. To create a shared folder, log in to your storage account and create a new folder. Then, share the folder with family members by inviting them to join the folder as collaborators.

## Step 3: Organize Your Files

With a shared folder in place, the next step is to organize your files. Create subfolders for different types of files, such as photos, documents, and videos. Add descriptive names and tags to files to make them easy to find. Use a consistent naming convention to avoid confusion and duplications.

## Step 4: Set Up Sharing Permissions

To ensure that all family members can access the shared library, you need to set up sharing permissions. Most storage services allow you to choose who can view, edit, and delete files in the shared folder. You can also set up password protection and two-factor authentication for added security.

## Step 5: Train Family Members

Finally, you need to train your family members on how to use the shared library. Show them how to access the shared folder, how to upload and download files, and how to edit and collaborate on documents. Encourage them to use the shared library as their central resource for information and to back up their own files regularly.

The benefits of a shared library are many. By consolidating your family's digital assets in one central location, you can save time, avoid confusion, and ensure that everyone has access to important information. You can also cut down on data duplication, save storage space, and eliminate the need for multiple backup systems. In short, a shared library can revolutionize your family's digital life forever.

In conclusion, the key to revolutionizing your family's digital life is to create a shared library. By choosing a storage service, creating a shared folder, organizing your files, setting up sharing permissions, and training family members, you can ensure that everyone has access to important information and collaborates on documents. So, start your shared library today and enjoy the benefits of a more organized, efficient, and collaborative digital family life.

### 
What to Know
 
##   Shared Family Libraries on Apple  
 

Apple lets you set up Family Sharing through iCloud. If you're on a Mac, iPhone, or iPad, you can set up a family account in iTunes and share content with family members. 

 

Prerequisites:

 

You'll need to designate one adult with a verified credit card and an Apple ID to manage the family account.

 

You can only belong to one family group at a time.

 

From a Mac Desktop:

 
- Go to System Preferences.
 - Select iCloud.
 - Login with your Apple ID.
 - Select Set Up Family.

 

You'll then be able to follow the instructions and send out invitations to other family members. Each person needs their own Apple ID. Once you've created a family group, you have the option of using it to share most of your content in other Apple apps. You can share most purchased or family-created content from Apple this way, so books from iBooks, movies, music, and TV shows from iTunes, and so on. Apple even lets you share your location through family groups. Sharing works slightly differently with iPhoto, where you can share individual albums with larger groups of friends and family, but you can't share full access to your entire library.

 
##   Leaving the Family  
 

The adult who owns the account keeps the content when family members leave, either by divorce and separation or by growing up and creating family accounts of their own.

 
##   Family Profiles on Your Netflix Account  
 

Netflix manages sharing by letting you create viewing profiles. This is a brilliant move for several reasons. First, you can restrict your children to content made for kids, and secondly because the Netflix suggestion engine can better tailor suggestions to you alone. Otherwise, your recommended videos can seem random.

 

If you haven't set up Netflix profiles, this is how you do it:

 
- When you log into Netflix, you should see your name and an icon for your avatar on the upper right side.If you click on your avatar, you can select Manage Profiles.From here you can create new profiles.Create one for every family member and give them distinct avatar pictures.

 

You can specify the age level for media on each profile. Levels include all maturity levels, teens and below, older kids and below, and little kids only. If you check the box next to Kid? only movies and TV rated for viewers 12 and younger will be shown (older kids and below).

 

Once you have profiles set up, you will see a choice of profiles every time you log into Netflix.

 

Netflix content is rented, not owned, so there's no question of digital property transfer. The account owner can just change their Netflix password and delete a profile. The history and recommended videos will disappear with the account.

 
You could also set up a profile reserved for guests so that their movie choices don't interfere with your recommended videos.
 

Each child will get an avatar so you can easily tell what content is in their Family Library.

 

Once you have a library set up, you can use the Your Content tab to put items in the Family Library of each child. (Adults see all shared content by default.) You can add items individually, but this is less efficient. Use the checkbox on the left side to select multiple items and add them to a child's library in bulk.

 

The Your Devices tab allows you to manage the Kindle portion of any phones, tablets, Fire sticks, or other devices running the Kindle app.

 

The two adult owners can leave at any time. They each take possession of the content they purchased through their own profile.

 
##   Google Play Family Libraries  
 

Google Play lets you make a Family Library to share books, movies, and music you purchase through the Google Play Store with up to six members of a family group. Each user will need to have to have their own Gmail account, so this is an option that only works for users who are age 13 and older.

 
- Log into Google Play from your desktop.Go to Account.Select Family.Select the Sign up for Family Library link and follow the instructions to invite family members.

 

Because family groups in Google are at least teenagers, you can choose to either add all purchases to the library by default or add them individually.

 

You can control access to content on individual Android devices by creating child profiles and adding parental controls to the content rather than by centrally managing it through the Google Play Family Library.

 
##   Leaving the Family Library  
 

The individual who set up the Family Library retains all the content and manages membership. He or she can remove members at any time. Removed members then lose access to any shared content.

 
##   Family Accounts on Steam  
 

You can share Steam content with up to five users (from up to 10 computers) on Steam. Not all content is eligible for sharing. You can also create a restricted Family View so that you only expose the games you want to share with children.

 

To set up Steam Family Accounts:

 
- Log into your Steam client
 - Make sure you have Steam Guard on.
 - Go to Account Details.
 - Scroll down to Family Settings.

 

You'll be walked through the process of setting up a PIN number and profiles. Once you have your family set up, you'll need to authorize each Steam client individually. You can turn Family View on or off using your PIN number.

 
##   Leaving a Family Account  
 

For the most part, Steam Family Libraries should be set up by one adult and players should be children. The content is owned by the account manager and vanishes when members leave.
