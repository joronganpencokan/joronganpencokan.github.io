# You Won't Believe This Simple Trick to Log Out of Websites Without a Logout Button – Try it Now!

Have you ever found yourself stuck on a website without a logout button? It can be frustrating not being able to log out of a website properly – especially if it's an important account. Fortunately, there's a simple trick to log out of websites even if they don’t have a dedicated logout button. 

Since the logout option isn’t always available on a website, you can try this easy trick to log out of the site without any hassle. The trick is to clear the cookies of the website in question. Cookies are small pieces of data that websites store on your computer, and clearing them can log you out of the website.

Here are the steps to log out of websites without a logout button:

Step 1: Open the website for which you want to log out.
Step 2: Click on the padlock icon on the top-left corner of your browser’s address bar.
Step 3: Then, click on the cookie (or site) settings option.
Step 4: Find the name of the website you want to log out of and select ‘remove’ or ‘delete cookies’.
Step 5: Refresh the webpage and Ta-dah! You have successfully logged out of the website.

It's important to note that clearing cookies will log you out of all the websites you've logged into on your browser. So, if you've logged into other sites, make sure to log out of them as well or save your login details somewhere safe – just in case you forget them.

Moreover, if you don't see the padlock icon on your browser's address bar, look for the three vertical dots to access settings, where you may find the same options.

Clearing cookies can have other benefits too. It can improve website loading speed and also free up some space on your computer. 

However, keep in mind that some websites use cookies to remember your preferences, so you may need to log in again, accept the website's terms and conditions, or configure some settings, such as the site's language or currency, after clearing cookies.

In conclusion, logging out of websites without a logout button isn't as complicated as you might think. With these simple steps, you can log out of any website in seconds. So, the next time you are trapped on a website, try this foolproof trick to log out of the website, and have peace of mind.

There are some websites that provide user login function, but the logout button is either missing or hard to find. It’s too risky to remain logged in, especially on a public computer, so you might want to try some workarounds to log out. However, be warned that these might not work.
 
Usually it’s not your fault you can’t log out and is because of a site bug or a usability blunder. It doesn’t help much that it’s not your fault when your account is at risk of being compromised. If you are logged in from a computer nobody else but you uses, the risks aren’t that high, but if this is a shared computer, you most certainly need to log out ASAP. Here are a few tricks to try, but don’t expect them to always work.
 
## 1. Close the Browser, Reopen, and See If You Are Still Logged In
 
As a rule, just closing the browser doesn’t log you out, so don’t count on this option too much. If this will work or not depends on the site. Most sites store logins for days, weeks, or months, but there are also sites that require a login on every reopen of the browser. If this is the case, you are lucky. When you close the browser, open it again and see if you are out or not.
 
## 2. Search Hard, Really Hard, for that Logout/Signout Button/Link
 
Often the logout function is there, but it’s not visible right away. I know what you are thinking about the usability of such sites, and I side with you, but this doesn’t change the fact that for one reason or another many sites put their logout button/link in a hard-to-find place.
 
Most sites put their login/logout buttons/links in the top right corner, either standalone or in a menu, such as in account, settings, profile, or something similar. If you don’t see it directly, try browsing the menus or hover.
 

 
## 3. Delete the Session and Browser Cookie
 
You can also delete the session and browser cookie(s) to log out from a site. Most sites store login data in a cookie, and when this cookie is gone, you are logged out. If you are afraid you will lose all your cookies when you clear the browser’s cache, don’t worry; for most browsers you can delete the cookies only for a given site. The exact steps for deleting cookies differ among the different browsers, so check what’s applicable for yours.
 
## 4. Try Logging Out from a Different Browser/Device
 
It’s possible that the browser/device you are using is the problem. For instance, if your browser is old, it’s possible to click the logout button/link with no action taking place. In this case log in from a different browser/device and log out from there.
 
If the site doesn’t allow multiple simultaneous logins to the same account, the new login will eliminate the old. However, even though you logged in and logged out from a different browser/device, it’s possible you are still logged in in the original browser/device, so don’t forget to check if you are really logged out.
 
If you notice the logout problem happens with a particular browser/device only, your only option is to stop using this browser/device for this site. You can try contacting the site admins to tell them, but usually this won’t help. You’d better switch to a different browser. If you are a Linux user, try these Linux browsers instead.
 
## 5. Logout with SSO
 
If you logged in with Single Sign On (SSO), you can log out with it, too. For instance, if you logged in to a site with your Facebook or G+ account, go to Facebook or G+ and log out from there. Then go to the site you were trying to log out from, refresh the page, and see if you are still logged in.
 
## 6. If It’s a Popular Site, Check Its Forums
 
You might not be the only one with a logout problem with a particular site. Though it usually happens after a redesign of the interface or a software update when something gets broken, it’s not unheard for a site that has been okay for many years – all of a sudden its logout functionality breaks. In this case, if the site has a forum such as this one, check it to see what other users are experiencing and if there is a solution.
 
As I mentioned, there is no guarantee any of these tricks will work. If none of them work, there is nothing you can do but wait for your login timeout – your session will expire in a predefined amount of time. This isn’t much of a comfort because this predefined amount of time could be weeks or more, but basically you are out of any other options.
