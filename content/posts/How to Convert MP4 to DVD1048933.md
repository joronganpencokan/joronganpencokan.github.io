What to Know
 
- We recommend the DVDStyler app for creating custom DVDs from MP4 media files using a writable DVD drive and DVD. Click File > New > enter name and choose settings > OK > pick DVD menu template > OK > File browser > upload files > File > Save As. When you’re ready, insert an empty DVD into your disc drive and click File > Burn DVD. Make sure that burn is checked and click Start.

##   How to Burn MP4 to DVD on Mac, Windows, and Linux  
 

There are many popular DVD burners and converters available though, for the following example, we’ll use DVDStyler as it’s completely free and supports Mac, Windows, and Linux devices.

 

Here’s how to burn a playable DVD on Mac, Linux, or Windows so that you can watch your MP4 video on your television.

 
- Open DVDStyler and click File.
 - Click New.
 - Enter a custom name for your DVD if you want one and choose the appropriate PAL/NTSC and aspect ratio settings. The default settings for the other options should be fine though you can change them if you like.
 - If your MP4 video file plays in a square, choose 4:3. If it’s a widescreen or rectangle video, select 16:9.
 - When you’re ready, click OK.
 - You will now be presented with several DVD menu templates. Replace Disc Title with the main title you want to see shown on your menu and choose a template that suits your MP4 file’s content or your own personal preference.
 - When you've made your selections, click OK.
 - You can change the look at any time by accessing the Backgrounds and Buttons menus to the left of the main work area.
 - Click File browser from the left menu, locate your video file or files and drag them to the box at the bottom of the screen.
 - Note
 - The amount of available time on your DVD will be displayed in the lower-right of the app.
 - Click File > Save As and save your project file.
 - Save this file to a folder on your computer, not to your DVD. You can then use this file to create additional copies of your DVD or to make changes in the future.
 - When you’re ready, insert an empty DVD into your disc drive and click File > Burn DVD.
 - Make sure burn is checked and click Start.
 - If the burn option is faded or you can’t select it, close the app, make sure that your DVD drive is connected, open your project in DVDStyler, and try the Burn DVD option again. If this doesn’t fix the problem, it’s likely that your drive doesn’t support DVD writing or that it’s not working properly.
 - The burn MP4 to DVD process will now begin. Depending on the amount of video content you’re converting, the burning could take anywhere from half an hour to several hours.

##   Alternatives to Creating DVDs From MP4 Files  
 

Creating DVDs from MP4 and other files used to be a popular way to get video content from your computer to your TV. Still, several other methods are worth trying as they can be more convenient and don’t require the purchase of a writable DVD drive or discs.

 
- Wireless streaming. Many smart TVs, Blu-ray players, and video game consoles support wireless streaming from computers, smartphones, and tablets via Chromecast, Miracast, AirPlay, or another method. You may be able to watch something from your device on your TV with just a few taps.
 - HDMI cable connection. Many computers support HDMI-Out, which can mirror its display on a TV via an HDMI cable. Can’t find an HDMI-Out port on your device? There are a variety of HDMI adapters that can connect almost any device to a TV nowadays.
 - Cloud services. Some cloud services have apps on smart TVs and video game consoles that let you stream the video content you’ve uploaded. Plex is one such service that has strong app support on various devices. Microsoft’s OneDrive also has an app on Xbox consoles. It lets you view any video file that you’ve added to your OneDrive account directly on your Xbox One or Xbox Series X console.
 - USB sticks and external drives. If your TV or connected device has a USB port, you may be able to connect a USB stick or drive directly to it and watch your MP4 and other video files directly.
