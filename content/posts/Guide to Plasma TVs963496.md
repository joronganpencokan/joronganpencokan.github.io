Title: Revolutionize Your Viewing Experience: The Ultimate Guide to Plasma TVs!

Plasma TVs have been around for quite some time now and have been consistently loved by enthusiasts for their rich colours, deep blacks, and wide viewing angles. Here's your ultimate guide to revolutionizing your viewing experience with Plasma TVs.

What is a Plasma TV?

A plasma TV is a flat panel display technology that uses tiny cells to illuminate coloured phosphors. The cells are charged with a combination of neon and xenon gases, which then excite the phosphors and thus produce coloured light. This process is what creates the bright, colorful image you see on the screen.

Why Choose Plasma TVs?

If you're looking to upgrade your viewing experience, Plasma TVs can offer several advantages over other types of displays. Firstly, Plasma TVs have excellent image quality. They have a contrast ratio that is superior to both LCD and LED TVs, meaning that Plasma screens are capable of producing much darker blacks and much brighter whites.

Secondly, Plasma TVs also have a much wider viewing angle than other types of displays. This means that you can enjoy your favourite show or movie from almost any angle in the room without experiencing any distortion in the image quality.

Lastly, Plasma TVs are also great for gaming, as they have a fast response time and can display fast-moving images smoothly.

What are the features to look for in Plasma TVs?

Screen Size: Plasma TVs come in a wide range of sizes, from small 32-inch models to giant 65-inch displays. When selecting the screen size, make sure that it is appropriate for the room size and your viewing distance.

Resolution: Plasma TVs come in two resolutions, 720p and 1080p. 1080p is the higher resolution and offers more detail in the image. If you are a movie enthusiast or a gamer, it is recommended that you go for 1080p.

Connectivity: Plasma TVs come with a range of connectivity options, including HDMI, USB, and Ethernet. Make sure that the TV has sufficient connection options that will cater to your needs.

Smart features: Many plasma TVs nowadays come with smart features such as internet connectivity and access to streaming services like Netflix and Hulu.

Refresh rate: The refresh rate of a Plasma TV is measured in Hz and refers to the number of times the screen is refreshed per second. A higher refresh rate means a smoother image in fast-moving scenes.

Conclusion

In conclusion, if you're searching for the ultimate viewing experience, then Plasma TVs are the way to go. Plasma TVs offer excellent image quality, a wider viewing angle, and fast response times, making them perfect for watching movies, TV shows, and gaming. When buying a Plasma TV, make sure to look for the right screen size, resolution, connectivity, and refresh rate, and you'll be sure to get the best experience possible.

Plasma TVs, like LCD and OLED TVs, are a type of flat panel television. Although these TVs look similar on the outside, there are differences on the inside. Learn how plasma TVs work and whether or not these TVs are worth keeping.

 
##   How Does a Plasma TV Work?  
 

Plasma TV technology is similar to that used in a fluorescent light bulb. The display panel consists of cells, each containing two glass panels that are separated by a narrow gap. Neon-xenon gas is injected and sealed in plasma form during the manufacturing process. The gas is electrically charged at specific intervals when the plasma set is in use. The charged gas strikes red, green, and blue phosphors, creating a TV image.

 
In 2014, Panasonic, Samsung, and LG announced the end of plasma TV production, effectively discontinuing this type of TV. This article is preserved for historical reference.
 

Plasma TV technology is different from its immediate predecessor, the traditional cathode ray tube (CRT) TV. A CRT is a large vacuum tube in which an electron beam emanating from a single point in the neck of the tube scans the face of the tube rapidly. The red, green, or blue phosphors on the tube's surface are then lit up to create an image.

 

With plasma TVs utilizing a sealed cell with charged plasma for each pixel, the need for a scanning electron beam is eliminated. Thus, there's no need for a large vacuum tube. This is why CRT TVs are shaped more like boxes, and plasma TVs are thin and flat.

 
##   How Long Do Plasma TVs Last?  
 

Early plasma TVs have a half-life of about 30,000 hours, which means that the image loses approximately 50 percent of its brightness after 30,000 hours of watching. However, due to technology improvements made over the years, most plasma sets have a 60,000-hour lifespan, with some sets rated as high as 100,000 hours.

 
Each group of red, green, and blue phosphors on a plasma TV is called a pixel (picture element).
 

If a plasma TV has a 30,000-hour rating and is on eight hours a day, its half-life would be about nine years. If it's on four hours a day, the half-life would be about 18 years. Double these figures for a 60,000-hour half-life. If a plasma TV has a 100,000-hour rating and is on six hours a day, its half-life would be about 40 years. Even at 24 hours a day, a 100,000-hour half-life is about 10 years.

 

For comparison, a CRT TV loses about 30 percent of its brightness after about 20,000 hours. Since this process is gradual, most viewers aren't aware of this effect. Still, they may need to adjust the brightness and contrast controls periodically to compensate. As with any TV technology, display lifespan can also be affected by environmental variables, such as heat and humidity.

 
##   Do Plasma TVs Leak?  
 

The gas in a plasma TV does not leak, nor can more gas be pumped in. Each pixel element is a completely sealed structure (referred to as a cell), which includes a phosphor, charging plates, and plasma gas. If a cell fails, it can't be repaired by recharging the gas. If a large number of cells go dark, the entire panel needs to be replaced.

 
##   Can a Plasma TV Work at High Altitudes?  
 

Most plasma TVs are calibrated for optimum operation at, or near, sea-level conditions. Since the pixel elements on a plasma TV are glass housings containing rare gases, thinner air causes greater stress on the gases inside the housing.

 

As altitude increases, plasma TVs work harder to compensate for the difference in external air pressure. As a result, the set generates more heat, and its cooling fans (if it has any) work harder. This may cause a buzzing sound. In addition, the half-life of the plasma TV is reduced somewhat.

 

For most consumers, this is not an issue. Still, there are considerations if you live in an area over 4,000 feet above sea level. Some plasma TVs are robust enough to work well at altitudes of up to 5,000 feet or more. There are high altitude versions of some plasma TVs that can hold up to as high as 8,000 feet.

 
##   Do Plasma TVs Generate Heat?  
 

Since plasma TVs use charged gas, the set will be warm to the touch after being in operation for a while. Since most plasma TVs are wall or stand mounted, heat generation is usually not an issue with plenty of air circulation. However, plasma TVs use more energy than a standard CRT or LCD set.

 
##   What Is a Sub-Field Drive on a Plasma TV?  
 

TVs employ refresh rates and motion processing to display smooth images. LCD and plasma TVs typically have a 60hz refresh rate, but that is not always enough. To enhance motion response, plasma TVs employ additional technology called a sub-field drive.

 
Avoid placing a plasma TV in a tight space where it won't have enough room to dissipate the heat that it generates.
 
##   Are All Plasma TVs HDTVs?  
 

For a TV to be classified as an HDTV or as HDTV-ready, it must display at least 1024 x 768 pixels. While some plasma TVs meet the requirements for HD, no plasma TVs display 4K resolution, except for large-screen units made for commercial use.

 
Many TV buyers think that the sub-field drive rate is comparable to the screen refresh rates used in LCD TVs. However, the sub-field drive rate on plasma TVs works differently.
 

Some early model plasma TVs only display 852 x 480. These sets are referred to as EDTVs (Extended or Enhanced Definition TVs) or ED-plasmas. ED resolutions are fine for DVDs and standard digital cable, but not for HD sources. Plasma TVs that display HDTV signals accurately have a pixel resolution of at least 1280 x 720 (720p) or higher.

 

Some manufacturers labeled their 1024 x 768 plasma TVs as EDTVs or ED-plasmas, while others labeled them as plasma HDTVs. This is where looking at specifications is important. If you're looking for a true HD-capable plasma TV, check for a pixel resolution of either 720p or 1080p.

 
##   Plasma TVs and Scaling  
 

Since plasma TVs have a finite number of pixels, higher resolution input signals must be scaled to fit the pixel field count of the particular plasma display. An HDTV input format of 1080p needs a display of 1920 x 1080 pixels for a one-to-one pixel display of the HDTV image.

 

If a plasma TV only has a pixel field of 1024 x 768, the original HDTV signal must be scaled to fit that pixel count. So, even if your plasma TV is advertised as an HDTV with a 1024 x 768 pixel screen, HDTV signal inputs will be scaled down. If you have an EDTV with 852 x 480 resolution, any HDTV signals will have to be scaled down.

 
##   Will a Plasma TV Work With an Old VCR?  
 

All consumer plasma TVs work with any existing video device with standard AV, component video, or HDMI outputs. Since VHS is a low resolution and has poor color consistency, it doesn't look as good on a large plasma screen as it does on a smaller 27-inch TV. To get the most out of your plasma TV, use a Blu-ray Disc player or an upscaling DVD player.

 
The resolution of the image viewed on the screen does not always correspond to the resolution of the original input signal.
 
##   What Else Do You Need to Use a Plasma TV?  
 

Here are some tips on what you need to budget for in addition to your plasma TV to use it to its full potential:

 
- A surge protector.
 - A sound system. Although some plasma TVs have an internal sound system, it's best to connect it to a soundbar or a home theater receiver.
 - Connection cables to connect your plasma TV with your other components.
 - Source components, such as Blu-ray players, video game consoles, satellite or cable boxes, media streamers, and others.

 
##   Should You Keep Your Plasma TV?  
 

If your plasma TV still works fine for you, there's no reason to throw it out. However, you could improve your viewing experience by upgrading to a newer type of television.

 

Since plasma TVs have been discontinued, TV makers have introduced newer technologies such as 4K displays, HDR, Wide Color Gamut, and Quantum Dots (sometimes referred to as QLED) into OLED and LCD TVs. Before you buy a new TV, compare all available types and sizes to see what works best for you.
