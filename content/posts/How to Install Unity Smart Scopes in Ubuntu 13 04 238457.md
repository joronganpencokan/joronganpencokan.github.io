Are you tired of the boring interface of your Ubuntu 13.04? Do you want to make your system look smarter and more interactive? Then its time to install Unity Smart Scopes on your Ubuntu 13.04!

Unity Smart Scopes is a new feature introduced in Ubuntu 13.04 that allows users to search for content on their system and on the web from the dash. This installation tutorial will guide you through the steps to install Unity Smart Scopes on your Ubuntu 13.04.

Before we begin, make sure that your Ubuntu 13.04 is fully updated and all the necessary packages and repositorie are available. To check if your system is fully updated, open a terminal window and type the following command:

In the privacy settings, you will see an option for "Online Search". Simply click on the toggle button next to "Include online search results" to enable it.

Once you have enabled the online search results, you can start using the Unity Smart Scopes. Open the dash and type in a search query. You will see that along with the local results, you will also get online search results from popular websites such as YouTube, Wikipedia, and Amazon.

You can also customize the Unity Smart Scopes by adding or removing certain websites from the search results. To do this, open the dash and type in "Privacy". In the privacy settings, you will see an option for "Online Search". Click on the "Configure" button and you will be presented with a list of websites that you can include or exclude from your search results.

So there you have it! With the Unity Smart Scopes installed on your Ubuntu 13.04, you can now transform your boring interface into a smart and sleek one. With online search results available right from the dash, you will be able to find what you are looking for faster and more efficiently.

So go ahead, install the Unity Smart Scopes and enjoy the new and improved interface of your Ubuntu 13.04!


The Unity Smart Scopes is a powerful search tool for the Unity Dash in Ubuntu. It allows you to search for (almost) anything directly from the Dash. 
 
Until now, the Dash is using a lens system to manage your search. Install  a lens and you can click on its icon to perform a search for a specific item. For example, installing the Google Drive lens allows you to search for files in your Google Drive account. With the Unity Smart Scopes, it will replace the lens system and allows you to search for anything, online or offline, directly in the Dash. The Unity Smart Scopes was supposed to be shipped together with Ubuntu 13.04, but because of stability issue, it was removed from Ubuntu 13.04. Instead, it will be included in Ubuntu 13.10. If you are one of those who love to try bleeding edge stuff, here is how you can install Unity Smart Scopes in Ubuntu 13.04.
 
## Installation of Unity Smart Scopes
 
The installation is pretty simple. All you have to do is to add the PPA and upgrade your system. Here are the commands:
 
Note: If you run the last command “sudo apt-get dist-upgrade” and it prompts you to remove some packages, DO NOT PROCEED. It will/might break your system. It should only prompt you to install new packages and upgrade your existing packages. It shouldn’t remove anything from your system.
 
## Usage
 
Once installed, it will restart the current Unity session. This might cause your system to stand still for a while (it did to mine, but your condition might vary). After that, you can press the “Super” (or the “Windows”) key to open the Dash and start typing the term that you want to search. The result should show up almost immediately as you type. 
 

 
You can also preview the result by right clicking it. The Preview feature is an existing feature of Dash, and it is applicable to Smart Scopes too. 
 
## Conclusion
 
The Unity Smart Scopes is very useful for finding stuff on your desktop and on the Web. It doesn’t support Google search though (and it will be perfect if it does). Another thing is that the Smart Scopes is only available for the Unity desktop. If you are not a Unity desktop user, you are not able to use this. The question is, will this make you want to switch to Unity desktop?
