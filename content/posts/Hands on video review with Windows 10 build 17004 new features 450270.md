# You Won't Believe These Mind-Blowing Windows 10 Features in Build 17004 Until You See This Hands-On Video Review!

Microsoft has yet again released a powerful update for Windows 10 in build 17004, and the improvements are simply mind-blowing. Although the previous builds came with significant upgrades, build 17004 takes the Windows 10 experience to a whole new level. This latest update provides multiple features that make working with Windows 10, even more, efficient, and seamless.

Now, let's delve into the fantastic features of build 17004 and the reasons why you should try it out!

## Reimagined Start Menu

When upgrading to build 17004, one of the first things that you notice is the newly revamped Start Menu. The menu's design now features streamlined design with transparent backgrounds that seamlessly blend the Start Menu background with your desktop background. Moreover, the Start Menu is now customizable, giving you the freedom to fully personalize it to your preferences.

## Cortana Enhancements

Cortana is a virtual assistant that has proven to be a reliable productivity partner for Windows 10 users. As expected, Microsoft has introduced multiple enhancements to this feature with build 17004. Cortana has been upgraded to support ink starring for notes, which allows users to scribble their thoughts using a stylus or finger, and Cortana will take the notes and save them for later access. Cortana can also be used to control smart home devices, which is convenient for anyone who wants to control their home environment.

## Fluent Design System

The Fluent Design System is a design language that provides Windows applications with a more modern look and feel. Build 17004 integrates a new transparency effect to the taskbar, which looks visually stunning. The acrylic material effect gives way for light to pass through and create a soft blur on different parts of the OS, which adds to the unique feel of this new addition to build 17004.

## Improved Edge Browser

The latest build of Windows 10 comes with improved Edge Browser; it now features tabbed previews that allow users to see what’s on a tab by hovering the cursor over it, and the appearance of the tab changes to match the theme of the website your visiting. Some people may not be fond of the idea of overlapping content while hovering, but the visual preview improves task-switching efficiency levels significantly.

## Emoji Update

what a joy it is to use emojis in each and every communication! Building 17004 has brought a set of 107 new emoticons into the mix, with an emphasis on diversity, enabling people of all colors, genders, nationalities, and orientations to represent themselves with digital smileys.

## Virtual Desktops

If you require multiple desktop environments, Windows 10 comes with Virtual Desktops. This feature becomes even more efficient with build 17004. You can use the virtual desktops in two separate modes. The first mode allows users to move between a desktop without affecting the applications on the other desktops. Meanwhile, the second mode allows users to duplicate existing apps from one desktop to another. The virtual desktops lend themselves to create specific environments that enable you to work on different projects, without desktop clutter.

## Conclusion

Windows 10 build 17004 comes with fantastic features that enhance the overall user experience. Microsoft has made significant improvements to Cortana and introduced virtual desktops, the Fluent Design System, and the improved Edge Browser. All these updates are designed to make Microsoft Windows 10 a more efficient operating system. There’s no better way to discover these new features than to take build 17004 for spin; the experience sure will be worth your while!
