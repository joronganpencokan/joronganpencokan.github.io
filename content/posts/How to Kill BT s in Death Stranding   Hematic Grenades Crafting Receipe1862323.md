# Unleash Devastation On BTs In Death Stranding With This Explosive Crafting Recipe - The Ultimate Guide To Hematic Grenades!

If you're a fan of Hideo Kojima's blockbuster game, Death Stranding, then you know how tough it can be to take down BTs. These spectral monsters are a constant threat to Sam Bridges and his allies, and they can be incredibly difficult to defeat. However, with the right preparation and equipment, taking down BTs is easier than you might think. In this guide, we'll show you how to craft hematic grenades - powerful explosives that can deal devastating damage to BTs and other enemies.

## What Are Hematic Grenades?

Hematic grenades are a type of explosive that Sam Bridges can craft using materials he finds in the game's world. These grenades are unique because they use Sam's own blood to create a powerful explosion that can kill or severely damage enemies. Hematic grenades are especially effective against BTs because they are weak to Sam's blood. This makes hematic grenades one of the most valuable tools in Sam's arsenal.

## How To Craft Hematic Grenades

To craft hematic grenades, you'll need to gather a few key materials. The recipe for hematic grenades is:

- 1 x Resin
- 1 x Chemicals
- 1 x Cryptobiote

Resin and chemicals are both common materials that you can find in many places throughout the game's world. Cryptobiotes, on the other hand, are a bit rarer. These creatures can be found in caves and other dark places, and they are vital to Sam's survival. When consumed, cryptobiotes can restore Sam's health and relieve his stress levels. However, they can also be used to craft hematic grenades.

Once you have all of the necessary materials, open Sam's menu and select "Crafting." Scroll down until you find "Hematic Grenade" and select it. Sam will then craft a hematic grenade using the materials you've gathered.

## How To Use Hematic Grenades

Hematic grenades are incredibly powerful weapons, but they can be a bit tricky to use effectively. When you throw a hematic grenade, it will explode on impact, creating a large blast radius. This blast can damage or kill any enemies caught in its radius, including BTs.

To use a hematic grenade, select it from your inventory and aim it at your target. You can throw the grenade either by pressing the "throw" button or by holding down the button to charge up the grenade's power. The longer you charge up the grenade, the more damage it will do when it explodes.

## Tips For Using Hematic Grenades

Here are a few tips to keep in mind when using hematic grenades:

- Hematic grenades are most effective against BTs, so save them for when you're facing these enemies.
- You can carry a limited number of hematic grenades at once, so use them wisely.
- When you're facing a particularly tough enemy, try combining hematic grenades with other weapons or tools to create powerful combos.
- Keep an eye out for materials that can be used to craft hematic grenades, and gather them whenever you can.

## Conclusion

Hematic grenades are an essential tool for any Death Stranding player who wants to take down BTs and other enemies quickly and effectively. By following this crafting recipe and using hematic grenades strategically, you can unleash devastating attacks that will make short work of even the toughest opponents. So what are you waiting for?
