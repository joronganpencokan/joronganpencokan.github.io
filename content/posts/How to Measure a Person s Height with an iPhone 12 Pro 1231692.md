# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Measure Someone's Height Using Only Your iPhone 12 Pro!

The iPhone 12 Pro is one of the most advanced smartphones currently available on the market. It is packed with all kinds of features, from the latest A14 Bionic chip to a pro camera system with advanced capabilities. But did you know that it also has a built-in feature that lets you measure someone's height with just a few taps on your screen? That's right; the iPhone 12 Pro has a measuring tool that uses AR technology to measure objects and people, including their height.

Here's how you can use your iPhone 12 Pro to measure someone's height quickly and easily:

Step 1: Launch the Measure app on your iPhone 12 Pro.

The Measure app is pre-installed on all iPhone 12 Pro devices, so you don't need to download or install anything. Just find the Measure app on your device and tap to launch it.

Step 2: Position your iPhone 12 Pro in front of the person you want to measure.

To measure someone's height accurately, you need to position your iPhone 12 Pro so that it can see the person's entire body. Stand about 6 feet away from the person and hold your iPhone 12 Pro up so that the camera is facing the person from head to toe.

Step 3: Start the measurement.

Once you have positioned your iPhone 12 Pro correctly, tap on the plus icon to start the measurement. The camera on your iPhone 12 Pro will use its AR technology to detect the person's body and mark their height.

Step 4: Move your iPhone 12 Pro to get a complete measurement.

To get an accurate measurement of the person's height, you need to move your iPhone 12 Pro around so that it can capture their entire body. Move your device slowly and keep it steady until you get a complete measurement.

Step 5: Save or share your measurement.

Once you have measured the person's height, you can save the measurement to your device or share it with others. Tap on the save button to keep the measurement for future reference, or tap on the share button to send it to others via email, text, or social media.

Using the Measure app on your iPhone 12 Pro is an easy and convenient way to measure someone's height without the need for traditional measuring tools. It's perfect for when you need a quick and accurate measurement while on the go, whether it's at the doctor's office, the gym, or just for fun. So next time you need to measure someone's height, try using the Measure app on your iPhone 12 Pro, and see just how easy it really is!

One of the main additions to the iPhone lineup with the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max was the addition of a LiDAR sensor. The LiDAR sensor is the black dot near the camera lenses, about the same size as the flash. The LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor uses lasers to judge distances and depth. It has many promising applications in augmented reality and related apps; however, we haven’t seen much use of it yet. Here we show you how to measure a person’s height with an iPhone 12.
 
## How Does LiDAR Work?
 
LiDAR is a type of time-of-flight camera. Normal smartphone cameras measure depth with a single light pulse. However a LiDAR sensor sends waves of light pulses out in a spray of infared dots. Each one is measured with the sensor, which creates a field of points and allows the sensor to map out distances. Using these points, the device can “mesh” the dimensions of the area or space and the objects in it. These pulses are invisible to the human eye, but you can see them with a night vision camera.
 
One of the neat little features of the sensor is allowing users to measure the height of a person. Measuring lengths and heights was also available on previous versions of the iPhone, but the built-in LiDAR sensor on the latest iPhones makes this more accurate and precise.
 
## Measuring Height Using the Measure App
 
Apple’s built-in Measure app allows you to measure the height of a person accurately.
 
1. Open the Measure app on your iPhone.
 
2. Click on the Measure tab from the bottom of the window.
 
3. Make sure the person’s entire body is within your screen.
 
4. You’ll see a dot appear on the screen, which is used to measure height and length. Tap on it and drag it to the top of the subject’s head. This should automatically tell their height.
 
5. Tap the shutter button to take their photo (if needed).
 
6. Tap the image in the lower-left corner to save the photo, then tap Done. Save the photo to Photos or Files.
 
That’s it! Using this handy feature, you can easily measure the height of anyone using your iPhone. If you’d like to re-measure the person, make sure to point the iPhone away before pointing it toward them again. This will reset the previous height measured.
