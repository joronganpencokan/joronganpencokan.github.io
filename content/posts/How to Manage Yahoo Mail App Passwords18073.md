# 10 Surprising Tips to Secure Your Yahoo Mail Account with Passwords â€“ Don't Miss Out!

If you're using Yahoo Mail, chances are, you already know the importance of having a strong password. You may have even chosen a long and complicated password to protect your email account from prying eyes.

However, having a strong password alone is not enough to keep your Yahoo Mail account secure. You need to follow additional security practices to keep your account safe from data breaches, hackers, and cybercriminals.

In this article, we have compiled ten surprising tips that will help you secure your Yahoo Mail account with passwords. Let's dive into it.

## 1. Use a Random String of Characters

Instead of using a dictionary word or a combination of dictionary words, use a random string of characters for your password. Use a combination of letters (upper and lower case), numbers, and symbols. The longer the password, the better.

## 2. Avoid Using Personal Information

Do not use any personal information, such as your name, birth date, or address, as part of your password. This information is easily accessible to hackers and can be used to guess your password.

## 3. Use Different Passwords for Different Accounts

It is a good practice to use different passwords for different accounts. If you use the same password for all your accounts and one of them gets hacked, your other accounts are also at risk.

## 4. Use Two-Factor Authentication

Yahoo Mail offers two-factor authentication, a security feature that requires you to provide an additional code along with your password to access your account. This feature adds an extra layer of security and makes it difficult for hackers to gain access to your account.

## 5. Enable Password Recovery Options

Make sure you enable password recovery options such as security questions, alternate email, and phone number recovery. These options will help you recover your account in case you forget your password or your account gets hacked.

## 6. Change Your Password Regularly

Change your password regularly, at least once every six months. This will reduce the risk of your password being hacked, and it will also ensure that you are using a strong password.

## 7. Don't Share Your Password

Never share your password with anyone. Not even with your closest friends or family members. Sharing your password makes it easier for hackers to gain access to your account.

## 8. Be Wary of Phishing Emails

Be careful when clicking on links in emails. Phishing emails are designed to trick you into providing your password and other personal information. Always verify the sender's email address and the content of the email before clicking on any links.

## 9. Use a Password Manager

A password manager is a tool that helps you generate and store strong passwords. This tool also helps you manage your passwords and makes it easier to change them regularly.

## 10. Check Your Account Activity Regularly

Keep an eye on your account activity regularly. Check for any unauthorized logins or any other suspicious activity. This will help you identify any security breaches and take necessary action promptly.

In conclusion, securing your Yahoo Mail account with passwords is critical in today's digital age. By following the tips we have listed above, you can ensure the safety of your account and protect your personal information from cybercriminals. Stay vigilant, stay alert and stay secure!
