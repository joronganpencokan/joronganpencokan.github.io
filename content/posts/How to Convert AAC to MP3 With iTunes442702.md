##   How to Get the Best Sound Quality for Converted Files  
 

Converting a song from AAC to MP3 (or vice versa) can result in a loss of sound quality for the converted file. That's because both formats keep the file size small by using compression technologies that reduce some sound quality at high and low frequencies. Most people don't notice this compression.

 

Select the songs you want to convert to MP3. To select multiples files, press Ctrl on Windows or Command on Mac and click each file.

 

Go the File menu.

 

Select Convert.

 

Select Create MP3 Version.

 
ITunes notifies you if any of the songs you choose cannot be converted due to DRM restrictions. Deselect those songs to proceed.
 

Wait while the files are converted.

 

When the conversion from AAC to MP3 is complete, the iTunes Library contains a copy of the song in each format.

 
To find out if a file is in AAC or MP3 format, select the file and press Ctrl+I on Windows or Command+I on a Mac to display the song information window. Then, go to the File tab and look in the Kind field.
 

If you don't want the ACC files, delete the song files from iTunes.

 

This means that AAC and MP3 files are already compressed. Converting the song to a new format further compresses it. You may not notice this difference in audio quality, but if you have great ears or great audio equipment, you might.

 

Ensure the best audio quality for files by converting from a high-quality original, rather than a compressed file. For example, ripping a song from CD to MP3 is better than ripping it to AAC and then converting to MP3. If you don't have a CD, find a lossless version of the original song to convert.
