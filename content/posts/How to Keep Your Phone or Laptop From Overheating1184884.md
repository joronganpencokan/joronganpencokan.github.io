Title: You Won't Believe These 5 Surprising Tricks to Prevent Your Phone or Laptop from Overheating!

Introduction:
It's a common problem that we all have faced at some point in time- the overheating of our electronic devices, especially our phones and laptops. This problem not only affects the performance of our devices but also shortens their lifespan. But fret not, because in this article we will be discussing five surprising tricks to prevent your phone or laptop from overheating.

1. Keep Your Phone or Laptop out of Direct Sunlight:
One of the most common reasons for the overheating of our electronic devices is direct sunlight. The UV rays of the sun can significantly increase the temperature of our phone or laptop, leading to overheating. Therefore, it's always advisable to keep your devices out of direct sunlight by placing them in a shaded or cool area.

2. Use Cooling Pads for Your Laptop:
Using cooling pads for your laptop is an effective solution to prevent your device from overheating. Cooling pads are designed to distribute excess heat away from the laptop and create a cooling effect, thereby preventing overheating. These pads can be easily found online or in electronic stores.

3. Keep Your Device Clean:
Dust can accumulate on the surface of our phones and laptops, clogging up the cooling vents and fans. This, in turn, can lead to overheating. Therefore, it's important to keep your device clean by wiping it regularly with a clean and dry cloth. You can also use an air blower to clean the vents and fans.

4. Avoid Multitasking:
Running multiple apps or programs simultaneously can also lead to overheating of your device. Therefore, it's recommended to avoid multitasking and close any unnecessary apps or programs. The fewer apps you have running, the lesser the load on your device, and the lesser the chances of overheating.

5. Turn on Battery Saver Mode:
Modern smartphones and laptops come with a battery saver mode that can significantly reduce the load on your device, thereby preventing overheating. This mode limits the performance of your device, disables background app refresh, and reduces screen brightness to conserve battery life.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, overheating is a common problem that can significantly affect the performance and lifespan of our electronic devices. However, following these simple tricks can help prevent our phones and laptops from overheating, ensuring their longevity and optimum performance. So the next time you feel your device getting too hot, try one of these tricks and prevent the problem before it starts.

This article explains how to keep your laptop and smartphone from overheating on hot days.

 
### 
What to Know
 
- Keep laptop below 122°F, iPhone between 62° and 72°F, MacBook between 50° and 95°F.Keep devices out of direct sunlight and hot cars. Turn off devices when in high heat. Don't use device until cool.Turn off battery-intensive applications like GPS, 4G or 5G, and high screen brightness. Use power waving settings.

 
##   Check the Temperature  
 

Although it's perfectly normal for computers and smartphones to get warm thanks to the battery heating up, there is, of course, an upper limit to how hot these devices can get before they start overheating.

 

If your laptop feels like it's running too hot and has started showing performance problems, use a free temperature monitoring tool to see if your laptop is in danger of overheating. You'll know if your laptop is overheating if you see the telltale signs.

 
The general guideline for laptops is to keep them running below 122°F (50°C), with more leeway for newer processors.
 

Some smartphones offer built-in temperature sensors that can tell you if the phone or battery is getting too hot, and many smartphones will automatically shut down if the phone gets too hot.

 

For storing your iPhone or MacBook, you can keep it in temperatures between -4° and 113°F (-20° to 45°C).

 
Apple recommends an ideal temperature zone of 62° to 72°F (16° to 22°C) for iPhones to work well and describes ambient temperatures higher than 95°F (35°C) as damaging temperatures that could permanently ruin the battery capacity. MacBooks work best if the temperature remains between 50° and 95°F (10° to 35°C).
 
##   Keep Your Laptop or Smartphone out of Direct Sunlight and Hot Cars  
 

Be careful where you leave your gadgets. Anyone who has been in a closed up car on a hot day can tell you that it gets really, really hot, and our skin isn't the only thing that hates hot weather. 

 

If you leave your phone or computer in direct sunlight or baking in a hot car, even touching it can burn your hand. It gets worse if it's playing music, taking a call, or charging, since the battery is already working up a sweat.

 

Turn your device off in those high-heat areas and try to only use them in the cooler shade. One option is to cover it with a shirt or sit with it under a tree. If you're in a car, try pointing the air conditioning vent in its general direction.

 
##   Wait to Use Your Hot Laptop or Smartphone  
 

When moving from a hot area to a more temperate one, wait until your laptop or smartphone has cooled off a bit before turning it back on. Ideally, wait until the device resumes its normal thermal operating range.

 
##   Turn Off the Most Battery-Intensive Applications  
 

Turn off the most battery-hungry apps and features. Not only do features like GPS and 4G/5G or the highest screen brightness tax your laptop or smartphone battery life, but they also make your battery run hotter.

 

Similarly, use your device on its battery-saving (e.g., "power saver") setting to use less battery and reduce battery heat automatically.

 

This mode is available on Android, iPhone, and most Apple and Windows laptop models.

 

Airplane Mode instantly quits broadcasting on all radios, which disables Wi-Fi, GPS, and your cellular connection. While this mode prevents phone calls and internet access, battery usage declines sharply and gives the device time to cool down.

 
##   Use a Laptop Cooling Stand  
 

A laptop cooling stand is a great investment. These stands not only draw heat away from your laptop but they also position your laptop ergonomically.

 

Pop your laptop into a cooling stand if it's getting too hot. It's really not a big deal if you're already using your laptop on a desk because the cooling stand will barely change how it's positioned.

 
##   Shut Down Your Laptop or Smartphone When Not in Use  
 

When it's really hot, perhaps the best thing you can do is turn off your device, reserving the power for when you actually need to use it.

 

Some devices turn off automatically when they get too hot, so shutting down all of the power to every component is one of the quickest ways to cool down the phone or laptop.

 

After 15 minutes of being in a cooler space, you can safely turn it back on and use it normally if it's mostly adjusted and is within its recommended thermal operating limits.

 
Unlike humans who benefit from rapid cooling when they run a high fever, tossing your overheated device into the freezer isn't going to help. In fact, the rapid stress on internal joins may well sever delicate wires within the device, damaging or destroying it.
