The GTA publisher Take-Two, a company that owns studios like Rockstar Games, 2K Games and Private Division, has important plans for the next five years. It was recently revealed that it is planning to release 93 video games by April 2025.
 
In a recent earnings call of fiscal results, Take-Two Interactive has laid down its future plans. The most striking news is that the company is interested in launching 93 games in the next 5 fiscal years. In other words, having this enormous number of releases before April 2025.
 
But, in any case, what kinds of games is Take-Two preparing? For starters we know that 72 of the 93 games are planned for consoles, PCs or streaming services. Out of those 72 games, there will be 7 that will also be available on mobile devices, while the remaining 21 will be exclusively for mobile phones and tablets.
 
It is also good to mention that the company has plans to expand its franchise catalog. We say this because 46 of the 93 projects correspond to new intellectual properties. As you can guess, the remaining 47 correspond to existing franchises. Another important point is that Take-Two is planning 26 free-to-play titles, while 67 will be paid games.
 
As we all very well know, the video game industry is complicated and many projects that start its development never see the light. This is why you should keep in mind that several of the 97 games that Take-Two mentions are likely never to hit the market.
 
“Note that these figures reflect a snapshot of our current pipeline as it stands today. It is likely that some of these title will not be developed to completion and we will undoubtedly be adding new titles to our slate,” said Karl Slatoff, the President of Take-Two.
