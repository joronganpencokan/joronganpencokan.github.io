Revolutionary Technology: AI Creates Stunning Masterpieces, No Artistic Ability Required!

Art has always been a form of expression that requires creativity, imagination, and artistic ability. But what if there was a way to create stunning masterpieces without possessing any artistic talent? This might sound impossible, but thanks to the revolutionary technology of Artificial Intelligence (AI) this is now a reality.

Artificial Intelligence is becoming more and more sophisticated every year, and with advancements in machine learning, AI can now analyze data and make decisions that were previously impossible. One of the applications of this technology is in the field of art. AI can now create stunning artworks that rival those created by human artists.

One such example is the work of a French art collective called Obvious. In 2018, they created a painting called "Portrait of Edmond de Belamy" using a type of AI called a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). GANs work by having two neural networks compete against each other. One network generates "fake" data, and the other network tries to determine whether the data is real or fake. Over time, the network that generates fake data gets better at fooling the other network, resulting in more and more realistic data.

Obvious trained their GAN on a dataset of 15,000 portraits from the 14th-20th centuries, and the result was the stunning portrait of Edmond de Belamy, which sold at Christie's auction house for a staggering $432,500. The painting is not an exact replica of any specific individual but was generated by the AI based on its analysis of the portraits in the dataset. The finished piece resembles a blurry, abstract portrait of a real-life subject, with ghostly shadows around the eyes and a smudged beard.

Another example of AI-generated art is The Next Rembrandt, a project that used machine learning to create a new portrait in the style of the famous Dutch artist. Researchers analyzed Rembrandt's works to determine his style, techniques, and colors. They then created a 3D model of a face that matched his style and used machine learning to predict which facial features would be the most likely in a Rembrandt portrait. The final artwork was created with a 3D printer, following the instructions generated by the AI.

The potential uses for AI-generated art are endless. This technology could be used to create customized art for individuals or even entire industries. AI could be used to design clothes, furniture, or automobiles, reducing the time it takes to bring innovative ideas to market.

However, some critics argue that AI-generated art is not "real" art since it lacks the human touch and emotions that go into creating traditional artworks. They also point out that these AI-generated pieces were created by human programmers who set the parameters, selected the dataset, and programmed the algorithms. As such, they argue that the AI is merely a tool and not a true artist.

Regardless of these arguments, there is no denying that AI-generated art is a revolutionary technology that is changing the way we think about art and creativity. It is amazing to see how AI can analyze vast amounts of data and generate something truly beautiful and inspiring. As AI continues to evolve, we are sure to see even more incredible art that is beyond the realm of human imagination.

AI increasingly is being used to make artwork, but experts disagree over whether computers truly can be creative. 

 
### 
Key Takeaways
 
- While AI can create novel images and music, experts continue to argue whether computers can make art. A new website called Artifly lets users guide AI-generated art for purchase. Other websites let you use AI to create music.

 

A new website even lets you try your hand at collaborating on art with AI. Artifly gets to know the user's preferences and creates artwork based on what they like. Not everyone thinks this process makes Artifly an artist, however. 

 

"Creativity is an innately human characteristic with the power to help us cope, connect, and be inspired," Scott Prevost, software firm Adobe's vice president of engineering, who focuses on AI technology, told Lifewire in an email interview. "However, I believe that AI done right can augment and enhance (not replace) human creativity."

 
##   Make My Art  
 

Artifly lets users scroll through a selection of artwork and click the designs they like. Then, the user clicks a button reading "Make My Art," and Artifly becomes familiar with your selections and creates personalized artwork. You can buy the art you have created. 

 

The AI art website is among several programs that let users experiment with using AI to create art. There’s Artbreeder, for example, which lets users select "the most interesting image to discover totally new images," according to the website. "Infinitely new random 'children' are made from each image. Artbreeder turns the simple act of exploration into creativity."

 

Other websites let you use AI to create music. Jukebox is a “neural net that generates music, including rudimentary singing, as raw audio in a variety of genres and artist styles,” according to the website. 

 

Some AI systems, known as generative models, learn patterns from existing data and generate new data with similar properties to what they've seen before, Tiago Ramalho, the CEO of AI consulting firm Recursive, told Lifewire in an email interview. The programs, he said, are not merely reproducing what they've seen before, but rather recombining the patterns they've seen into a new piece. 

 

“This is similar to what human artists do, taking inspiration from other pieces they've seen before and recombining them into something novel,” Ramalho said. “A big limitation of current AI programs, however, is that they are limited to only a certain modality (e.g., images, sound, etc.) and so cannot take as broad of inspiration as humans.”

 
##   Computer Artists?  
 

While AI can generate unique images, whether that counts as art depends on who you talk to. 

 

Nisha Talagala, the CEO and founder of AIClub.World, an educational company, uses an online tool to teach kids how to create art with AI. But, he said, AI can make music and art by learning patterns and combining them. 

 

“True human creativity, creating something purely different from what exists, is still beyond AI's reach,” he told Lifewire in an email interview. 

 

AI is ideal for identifying and following patterns, “while human creativity is all about breaking existing patterns and designing new ones,” Prevost said. 

 

While AI may not be creating art on its own, Prevost contends that AI can “democratize” human creativity. 

 

“AI can broaden the creative base by allowing those who don’t act as creative professionals to bring their creative inspiration to life on an ever-evolving digital canvas using intuitive tools that can automate historically complex processes—like replacing the sky in an image or changing the lighting in a video,” he said. 

 

For example, Prevost said, generative image filters and AI-powered visual search can allow artists to explore creative ideas in seconds, unlocking more creative possibilities. AI can train search algorithms to understand better images, including colors, composition, style, mood, and objects “so that these algorithms better understand the nuance and creative intent of an artist seeking inspiration, ultimately resulting in more meaningful results.”

 

Imagine being able to prototype a creative idea five different ways instead of one “including an outlier that turns out to be pure genius—all because AI can assume some of the heavy lifting,” Prevost said. “AI is a game-changer for creatives, cutting out much of the busywork, so they have more time to develop and explore new ideas—something humans do best.”
