Fortunately, there is a simple trick that can help you convert your IMG files into Odin flashable files without requiring any technical skills.

## Step 3: Convert Your File

Once you've selected the output format, it's time to convert your file. Click on the "Convert" button on the website, and the conversion process will begin. This may take a few moments, depending on the size of your IMG file.

Odin is one of those tools that helps you flash custom development files, such as custom ROMs and custom mods, on your Samsung devices. It is a widely used tool for flashing almost all types of Samsung devices that run Android as their operating system. In order to flash a file with Odin, it must be a valid Odin flashable file. Most of the times, especially while looking for custom recoveries, you come around files that have .img as their extension. These are nothing but image files that must first be converted to Odin flashable files to make them work with your device. So how do you go about converting an image file to an Odin flashable file?
 
Well, there’s a handy tool out there that lets you automatically create Odin flashable versions of image files. It has been developed by one of the talented developers over at XDA Forums.
 
The tool takes your image file as input and generates the output that is ready to be flashed with Odin. Here’s the step-by-step guide for how you can create an Odin flashable out of a normal image file.

5. It will do everything on its own, so there’s no user-interaction required. Just wait for it to finish the conversion.
 
6. When the Odin file is ready, the CMD window will close and you should be able to see the newly created file on your desktop.
