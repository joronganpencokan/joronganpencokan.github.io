Is Guilty Gear Strive's Matchmaking System Broken? Find Out How A Small Fix Could Change Everything!

Guilty Gear Strive is a new fighting game released on June 11th, 2021, by Arc System Works. The game is available on various platforms such as PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. The game has already gained immense popularity among gaming enthusiasts and fighting game lovers. However, like every other game, it has its fair share of flaws, which include a broken matchmaking system.

Players have been expressing their dissatisfaction with the matchmaking system of Guilty Gear Strive since its release. Despite having substantial player pools, players often struggle to find opponents. This, in turn, causes long waiting times or matchmaking errors, leading to frustration among players. The game's matchmaking system is supposed to pair players with opponents with a similar skill level, but that doesn't always happen. Often, players get matched with opponents that either significantly overpower or underpower them. This makes the game unbalanced and ruins the game's experience.

The game has an inherent problem with its unique ranking system, which contributes to a more significant issue with the matchmaking system. The game's ranking system uses points, which subsequently determine a player's rank. Players earn or lose points with every victory or loss, respectively. However, with the game's ranking system, unlike other games of its nature, a player can face an opponent ranked higher or lower than themselves. This causes players to grind more games, leading to frustration and burnout.

The solution to the issue lies in a small but straightforward fix. The matchmaking system needs to prioritize pairing opponents with similar points/rank, leading to balanced matches. The matchmaking system needs to balance out the points and ranks of both the players to ensure competitive matches. This way, players would be matched with opponents with similar skill levels leading to engaging gameplay. The current matchmaking system often matches high-ranked players with low-ranked ones, causing the game's imbalance, reflecting poorly on the developers.

Another potential solution is improving inter-continental connection stability. Since match-making connects players from different regions, a lousy connection could lead to unplayable matches and a below-average experience for both players in-game. It is essential to prioritize connecting players with optimal latency to ensure proper gameplay.

In conclusion, the matchmaking system is one of the significant problems plaguing the game currently. While the ranking system contributes to the issue, the matchmaking system prioritizing pairing opponents with similar ranks/points could increase its effectiveness. This solution would ensure players are playing against opponents with similar skill levels, leading to more engaging gameplay. The developers must release a patch fixing the issue soon to keep players engaged and further promote their player base.
