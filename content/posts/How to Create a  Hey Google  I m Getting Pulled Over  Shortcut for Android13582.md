Title: Learn the Life-Saving Hack All Android Users Must Know: Create a 'Hey Google, I'm Getting Pulled Over' Shortcut Today!

Intro:
Getting pulled over by a law enforcement officer can be an unnerving experience for many. However, a new feature by Google allows Android users to create a shortcut that can help during such instances. By creating a "Hey Google, I'm getting pulled over" shortcut, Android users can easily alert their contacts of the situation and record what's happening. Read on to learn how to create this important and life-saving hack today.

Body:
To create this shortcut, you will need to have the Google Assistant app installed on your device. You can install it from the Google Play Store if you don't already have it.

Step 1: Open the Google Assistant app on your Android device.
Step 2: Tap on the "Explore" icon (the compass) in the corner of the screen.
Step 3: Select the "Your shortcuts" option at the top of the page.
Step 4: Tap on the "+" button to create a new shortcut.
Step 5: Record a command phrase that will trigger the shortcut, such as "Hey Google, I'm getting pulled over."
Step 6: Now, under "Tell Assistant what to do," type in the actions you want the system to perform when you activate the shortcut. For example, you can tell it to send a text message to a pre-selected contact, turn on the phone's flashlight or start recording a video.

Creating a shortcut could potentially save your life. If you get pulled over by the police, you can activate the shortcut hands-free by using your voice, and the Google Assistant will trigger the actions you've set up. The system will send a message to your chosen contact or contacts explaining that you have been pulled over by the police, with your current location attached to the message. It can also activate the video recording or turn up the volume on your phone.

Creating this shortcut can help ensure your safety by allowing you to discretely document your interaction with law enforcement. Activating the shortcut will begin recording the incident, making sure that you have video evidence of your interaction with the police, which can be vital in certain situations.

Conclusion:
In a world where police brutality is rampant and unpredictable instances can take place during traffic stops, it's always prudent to be prepared. It's wonderful to know that we now have access to technology that could help protect us if we ever find ourselves in a potentially dangerous situation. The "Hey Google, I'm getting pulled over" shortcut could be an excellent tool for all Android users, providing them with a powerful means of alerting others and discretely documenting potential incidents. I commend Google for this feature and urge everyone to take advantage of it today.

Reddit user FeistyAppearance wrote instructions for this routine and YouTuber Juan Carlos Bagnell put together a video tutorial on what it does and how it works. In this case, you can add or change any of the steps we suggest. If you follow the steps we prescribe, your phone will:

 
If you want to test the routine, be sure you mute any Google Home speakers you may be around. Google Home speakers take precedence over phones when executing Google Assistant commands, and they can't do all of the steps in the routine, so they may get confused.
 
##   What Will an 'I'm Getting Pulled Over' Shortcut Do?  
 
- Send a text to a contact
 - Put your phone on silent
 - Turn down any media that might be playing (podcasts/music/etc.)
 - Set your screen brightness to zero
 - Turn on Do Not Disturb
 - Start a selfie video

 
##   Is This Getting Pulled Over By Police Shortcut Legal?  
 

Before creating this routine it's a good idea to know your legal standing regarding recording police encounters. Different states have different rules. The ACLU and EFF (Electronics Frontier Foundation) both have great articles about it, so it's a good idea to visit those sites, in addition to doing your own research. This is especially true if you live outside of the US.

 
The video that this routine starts is a "selfie video" meaning it is a video captured using the front-facing camera. This assumes that your phone is in a cradle mounted on your dashboard. If you intend to hold your phone, or have it positioned differently, you may want to capture a video with the rear-mounted cameras.
 
##   Recommendations for Police Interactions  
 

Generally, recording interactions with police in the course of their public duties is considered a First Amendment right under the Constitution of the United States. What's important is to stay calm, and do not prevent the police from exercising their duties. If you are a bystander, stay at a good distance. If you are a subject involved in the police action, stay calm, follow orders, and do not resist or interfere.

 
iPhones can use a Siri shortcut that allows you to do this automatically.
