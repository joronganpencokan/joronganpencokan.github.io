# You Won't Believe How Easy it Is to Install Ubuntu on Windows 10 - Learn the Simple Steps Now!

Are you a Windows user who's been curious about exploring the world of Linux? Do you want to try out Ubuntu but don't want to give up your familiar Windows environment? Then you're in luck because installing Ubuntu on Windows 10 is easier than you think!

Thanks to Microsoft's Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can now enjoy the benefits of Ubuntu while still having access to your Windows applications and files. In this article, we will walk you through the simple steps to install Ubuntu on Windows 10 using WSL.

## Step 1: Enable WSL

The first thing you need to do is enable WSL on your Windows 10 computer. To do this, open the Start menu and search for "Turn Windows features on or off." In the dialog box that appears, scroll down and check the box next to "Windows Subsystem for Linux." Then click the "OK" button and wait for Windows to install the necessary files.

## Step 2: Download Ubuntu

Next, you need to download Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store. Open the Microsoft Store and search for "Ubuntu." Click on the Ubuntu app and then click the "Get" button to download and install it. Don't worry, it's a small download and won't take up much space on your computer.

## Step 3: Launch Ubuntu

Once Ubuntu is installed, you can launch it from the Start menu. The first time you launch it, it will take a few minutes to set up. You'll be prompted to create a username and password, which you can use to log into Ubuntu from now on.

## Step 4: Update Ubuntu

The first time you log into Ubuntu, it's important to update it to ensure you have the latest security patches and bug fixes. To do this, open the Ubuntu terminal by clicking on the Ubuntu app icon, and then type the following command and hit enter: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade. This will update all the installed packages on your Ubuntu system.

## Step 5: Install Your Favorite Applications

Once Ubuntu is up to date, you can install your favorite Linux applications. Ubuntu comes with a package manager called APT, which makes it easy to install and manage applications. To install an application, open the Ubuntu terminal and type sudo apt install [application name], where [application name] is the name of the application you want to install.

## Conclusion

And that's it! You're now running Ubuntu on your Windows 10 computer, and you can start exploring the vast world of Linux applications and tools. With WSL, you get the best of both worlds, a solid and powerful operating system like Windows 10, plus the flexibility and versatility of Ubuntu. So go ahead, give Ubuntu a try, and let us know what you think!

You can install the Ubuntu distribution alongside Windows 10 to run your favorite Linux tools without switching computers or creating a virtual machine. Microsoft is moving to get more developers to code on any platform but using Windows 10 as their main tool.
