So, how can you get your hands on these Insider firmware updates? It's super easy! Just follow these simple steps:

1. Join the Windows Insider Program: To get access to the insider firmware updates, you need to become a part of Microsoft's Windows Insider Program. To do so, you just need to download the Windows Insider app from the app store and sign up for the program using your Microsoft account.

3. Choose an Insider level: Windows Insider Program offers different levels of insider access, each providing a different level of access to pre-release updates. The Program offers three levels of access - Fast, Slow, and Release Preview. The Fast ring receives updates first, while the Release Preview ring gets the most stable updates. Choose the Insider level that suits your needs and preferences. 

4. Keep your device updated: Once you've enrolled your device and chosen your Insider ring, all you need to do is keep your device updated with the latest firmware and software updates. The latest firmware and software updates can help to keep your device running at its best. 

By following these four simple steps, you'll be on your way to unlocking the full potential of your Windows 10 mobile device. 

In conclusion, Windows 10 mobile devices can run smoothly and efficiently with the help of Windows Insider firmware updates.

Windows Insider app for mobile devices updated to allow enrolled phones to receive firmware updates. Up until now mobile devices registered to be part of the Windows Insider Program weren’t allowed to receive new firmware updates. These updates were only available for devices that were configured to download production updates.
 
Since the Insider program began, users wanting to get the latest firmware for their devices needed to roll back using the Windows Device Recovery Tool before trying to install a new firmware update on their Lumia 950, Lumia 950 XL, and other Windows 10 Mobile devices enrolled in the Insider program.
 
## Install firmware update on Windows phones
 
Now the software maker is working on a solution to make it easier for Insiders to receive the firmware update without having to roll back. For now, there is a temporary workaround that Microsoft explains as follow:
 

 
- Open the Windows Insider application on your device.
 - Select Get preview builds.
 - Select Production from the list of options.
 - Read the presented message and tap accept to confirm your selection.
 - Your device may prompt to reboot.  If not, complete a manual reboot.
 - After the reboot, check for updates. If available, your device will display an update to receive the newest firmware.
 - Settings > Updates & security > Phone update > (check for updates). If the device shows a “no updates available” message, your device has the most recently available firmware
 - If available, complete the update by following the on-screen directions.
 - Once installed, re-open the Windows Insider application.
 - Select your desired update ring (Insider Fast or Insider Slow) and reboot as prompted.
 - Your device now has the newest firmware available and is set to receive the next flight when launched for your selected ring.

 
Microsoft notes that availability of firmware updates will depend upon country or particular mobile operator network, and some Windows 10 Mobile devices mobile devices with specific configurations may receive firmware updates at a later time.
