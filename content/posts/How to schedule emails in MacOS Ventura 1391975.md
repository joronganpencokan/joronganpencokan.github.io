Are you tired of forgetting to send important emails? Have you ever wished that you could schedule an email to be sent at a later time? If so, this article is for you. We'll show you how easy it is to schedule emails on your Mac using Ventura.

## What is Ventura?

Ventura is a powerful email client for Mac that offers a wide range of features, including the ability to schedule emails. With Ventura, you can compose an email and then set a date and time for it to be sent. This is perfect for when you want to write an email in advance but don't want to send it right away.

There are many reasons why you might want to schedule an email. Perhaps you want to send an email to a colleague or client but don't want to disturb them outside of work hours. Or maybe you want to send an important email but are worried about forgetting to do so. Scheduling emails can help you stay on top of your inbox and ensure that your messages are sent at the right time.

Step 4: Review Your Scheduled Emails
If you want to review your scheduled emails, you can do so by clicking on the "Scheduled" tab in the Ventura app. Here, you'll see a list of all the emails you have scheduled to be sent at a later date.

That's all there is to it! Scheduling emails on your Mac with Ventura is quick and easy, and it can help you be more productive and efficient.

Other email clients have just the right mix of form and function such that I can not only stay in constant communication with those within my various circles, but do so in such a way that the back and forth is clean, effortless, and effective.
Apple Mail does this in spades. I'd go so far as to say that Apple Mail is one of the finest email clients on the market. That's a hard pill to swallow for someone who is constantly pushing open source solutions and uses Linux as their daily operating system.
But I try to call them as I see them and Apple Mail is the best of the best. With the release of MacOS Ventura, the company has added a few new features that cement that opinion for me. One such feature allows you to schedule emails to send at the time of your choice.

## Why do you need to schedule emails?


Consider this: You have an important email to compose. Let's say you're sending your manager the email letting them know that you're moving on to another company. You've spent all Thursday night composing the perfect communication, but you don't want to send it right away because A) You don't want to receive that dreaded phone call in the middle of the night and B) You'd rather it land in their inbox during company time or a very specific time of day. Such planning can make a huge difference in how things are handled.
If that sounds even remotely like a situation you could possibly find yourself in, read on. Or maybe you just like the idea of composing emails at random times and sending them out on a schedule. 
With the new version of Apple Mail that ships with MacOS Ventura, this feature is not only built-in, but it's also incredibly easy to use. 

 
## How to schedule emails in MacOS Ventura


Let me show you how it's done.

 
## Requirements


The only thing you'll need for this to work is a device running MacOS Ventura. I'll be demonstrating this on a MacBook Pro, but the feature works the same on a MacBook Air or iMac. For those that prefer to go by version number, I'll be using Apple Mail v16.0. If you're using a version earlier than that, make sure to upgrade. 
And that's all there is to use Apple Mail's new feature for scheduling emails. This might seem like a tiny addition, but the benefits it offers can be considerable. Start using the feature and see if it doesn't make your email life a bit easier.
