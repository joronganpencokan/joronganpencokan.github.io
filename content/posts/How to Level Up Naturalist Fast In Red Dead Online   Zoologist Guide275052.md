Unlock Secret Rewards and Rare Animals FAST: Master the Ultimate Naturalist Level Up Guide in Red Dead Online!

Have you ever dreamed of discovering more of Red Dead Online's natural world? Do you want to unlock rare animals and reap the rewards that come with mastering the Ultimate Naturalist Level Up Guide? If yes, then you have come to the right place! In this article, you will learn everything you need to know to level up as a naturalist quickly and unlock all the secret rewards and rare animals in Red Dead Online.

Before we dive into the guide, it is important to note that becoming a naturalist is quite different from the other professions in Red Dead Online. As a naturalist, your job is to explore the natural world, study animals, and preserve their habitats. So, if you are not into nature or conservation, then this might not be the profession for you. However, if you are ready to take on the challenge, then let's get started!

Step 1: Purchase the Naturalist Role

The first step to becoming a naturalist is to purchase the Naturalist Role from Madam Nazar, the traveling saleswoman. Once you have paid the 25 gold bars required, the role will be added to your character's profile. You can access it by opening the quick menu and selecting "Roles" from the list.

Step 2: Complete the Introduction Mission

After purchasing the Naturalist Role, you will be tasked with completing an introductory mission. This mission will give you an idea of what is expected of you as a naturalist and will introduce you to the legendary animals. Once you have completed the introduction mission, you will be able to start your naturalist journey.

Step 3: Hunt and Sample Animals

As a naturalist, your primary job is to study and collect samples from animals. To do this, you will need to equip your binoculars and use them to spot animals in the wild. Once you have located an animal, you can approach it and take a sample using a specialized kit.

Step 4: Sell Samples to Harriet

After you have collected samples from various animals, you can take them back to Harriet, the conservationist. She will evaluate your samples and pay you in Naturalist XP and money. This will help you level up faster and unlock more rewards.

Step 5: Hunt Legendary Animals

Legendary animals are extremely rare and require special techniques to hunt. To hunt legendary animals, you will need to track them using clues and signs, and then capture or kill them. Doing this will give you huge amounts of Naturalist XP and unique rewards.

Step 6: Help Harriet with Conservation Efforts

As a naturalist, your job is not only to study animals but also to help preserve their habitats. Harriet will give you various conservation efforts to carry out, such as rescuing animals from poachers or protecting them from human encroachment. Completing these efforts will also give you Naturalist XP and rewards.

Step 7: Unlock Naturalist Rewards

By leveling up as a naturalist, you will unlock unique rewards that are not available anywhere else in the game. These include clothing items, weapons, and exclusive horse breeds. So, keep hunting and studying animals, and you will be rewarded!

In conclusion, becoming a naturalist in Red Dead Online is a rewarding experience that requires patience and dedication. By following this guide, you can level up quickly and unlock all the secret rewards and rare animals. So, grab your binoculars, and let's get started!

In this guide, you can learn how to Level Up Naturalist in Red Dead Online. To become a recognized Red Naturalist in the game you will have to unlock its max level. Level up requires XP and you can earn the points via different activities. So here is what you have to do.
 
## How to Level Up Naturalist Fast in Red Dead Online
 
You will have to become a Zoologist in Red Dead Online to rank up as Naturalist. As the Zoologist, you will have to classify different animals by tracking and sedating them. So here is the basic way to earn XP and become a recognized Naturalist in RDO.
 
- Track down the animal and sedate them. Collect the sample, each one value 65XP. Also, you can exchange the samples for exotic tonic.
 - You can also hunt the animals and skin them. Skin can unlock rare clothing and other items.

 
But before you start any of these activities in Red Dead Online you will need some items. You will require a Varmint Rifle with .22 sedative rounds. This is the basic requirement to start your journey in tracking down the animals.
 
### Tips and tricks to Level Up Naturalist
 
- To speed up the process of reviving animals you will have to purchase Reviver until you reach Rank 5. After Rank 5 at Rank 6, Reviver Crafting will be unlocked.
 - You can earn 10 additional XP per animal after collecting their sample and reviving them. Legendary animals unlock 20 additional XP.
 - Instead of devoting all your time to finding Legendary Animals focus on collecting more and more samples. Legendary Animals are super rare to find.

 
Legendary Animals can unlock up to 200XP but it is a highly time-consuming process. You cannot track down a Legendary Animal even after having the Legendary Map. So focus a lot on animals you find in your way. Instead of dreaming for 200XP you can collect samples from regular animals and fill up your rank meter.
 
You will also unlock 195XP on per poacher mission after reaching Naturalist Rank 5 in reading Dead Online. But these missions will not be available on the go. You have to wait for them and to complete the same visit to the assigned location and free the animals by killing the poachers.
 
Instead of waiting for poachersâ€™ mission keep exploring and collect animal samples. Animals of a single category can unlock a lot of cash and XP in Red Dead Online. Legendary Animals unlocks between 300 to 400XP per-mission.
 
Just keep the calculation in your mind and focus on getting enough samples. If you are lucky you will get some Legendary Animal and Poacher missions in between that will save a ton of your time. One final thing buys Outlaw Pass if you have a lot of money and hate waiting.
