You Won't Believe How This Simple Trick Lets You Control Your Mac with Just Hand Claps!

If you're looking to make your life a little easier while using your Mac, you're in luck. There's a simple trick that has been discovered that will allow you to control your Mac with just hand claps. That's right, you can now adjust the volume, play or pause music, and perform other tasks all while sitting back and relaxing.

The trick requires using the microphone that is built into your Mac to pick up the sound of your hand claps. Once set up, you can clap your way to controlling your Mac. Here's how to set this up:

Step 1: Open Automator

To get started, open up the Automator app on your Mac. This app allows you to create custom workflows and applications that can automate processes on your Mac. It comes pre-installed on your Mac and can be found in the Applications folder.

Step 2: Create a New Workflow

Once you have Automator open, select "New Document" from the list of options. This will open a new workflow in Automator.

Step 3: Choose the "Audio" Action

Next, you'll want to select the "Audio" action from the list of actions available in Automator. This action will allow your Mac to listen for sound and take actions based on what it hears.

Step 4: Set Up the Audio Action

Once you've selected the "Audio" action, you'll need to set it up. First, make sure the "Input Volume" slider is set to about halfway. This will allow your Mac to pick up the sound of your claps without picking up too much background noise.

Next, select the "Clap Twice" option in the "Sound Detection" section. This tells your Mac to listen for two distinct claps before taking any action.

Finally, select the action you want your Mac to take when it hears your claps. For example, if you want your Mac to pause or play music when it hears your claps, select the "iTunes" action and then select the "Play" or "Pause" option.

Step 5: Save Your Workflow

Once you've set up the audio action, you'll want to save your workflow. To do this, select "File" from the menu bar and then select "Save." Give your workflow a name and select a location to save it.

Step 6: Test It Out

With your workflow saved, it's time to test it out. Open up iTunes or another app you want to control with your claps and start playing music. Then, clap twice and listen for your Mac to take the action you specified.

If everything is working correctly, you should be able to control your Mac with just hand claps. Adjust the volume, play or pause music, and perform other tasks without ever touching your keyboard or mouse. It's a simple trick, but one that can make your Mac experience a whole lot more convenient.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a fun and innovative way to control your Mac, give this trick a try. All you need is a pair of hands, and before you know it, you'll be clapping your way to a more efficient computing experience.

Are there times or situations when you find it hard to control your Mac? Wouldn’t it be easier if you could control your Mac, such as opening iTunes, just by clapping your hands? Well luckily you can with iClapper.
 
iClapper is a semi-free Mac app that recognizes your hand clapping commands by analysing the sound input of your Mac’s microphone. As the website states, you can assign any action to a certain number of recognized claps, as well as to a combination of claps. The app is free, but there is also a Pro version that supports custom Applescripts.
 
Let’s see how it all works.
 
## Getting Started
 
1. Download iClapper from the Mac App Store and open it up on your computer.
 
2. You’ll be able to watch a short introductory video and go through a quick calibration process, which involves a series of single claps that you’ll have to do – so make sure you’re in a quiet room/location.
 
3. Once you’re done with the calibration, you’ll be able to add presets and rules under the Actions tab in Preferences.
 
## Actions
 
1. The Preferences window should already be open on your computer, if not you can select it from iClapper’s menu bar icon. Under the Actions tab in Preferences, you can create various presets and you can use different rules for each one.
 

 
For instance, you can have a set of rules for at home and a different set of rules for when you’re at work.
 
2. As stated above, you can create a set of rules for each of your presets. Your rules will contain a command, action, and optional confirmation message.
 
3. To create a rule, click on the plus sign at the bottom of “Rules” and then customize the command and action as you’d like.
 
4. For commands you can choose a certain number of claps or combinations of claps. If you choose a certain number of claps, you can choose how many claps to use (2 to 5).
 
If you choose combination then you can choose how many claps to have in your first set and how many to have in the second set (1 to 5 per set). You’ll need to put a noticeable break between each set of claps for iClapper to recognize it.
 
5. For actions, you can choose to have your Mac say something such as the time or date. You can also choose to run or play iTunes, check your email, or play/pause QuickTime. If you want even more actions, you’ll have to pay for them.
 
6. If you want a confirmation message to pop-up before an action is performed, you can enable it on a rule-by-rule basis. This is especially useful if you choose to have iClapper put your computer to sleep or shut it down.
 
You can purchase individual sets of actions for $0.99 each, or you can get all current and future available actions packs for just $3.99 (the better deal).
 
7. If you want to remove a rule, just click on the minus button at the bottom (next to the plus button).
 
## Other Features
 
1. You can have iClapper notify you about clap recognition, performed actions, and confirmations; it even supports Growl if you’re still using it on your Mac. You can customize them under the Notifications tab in the Preferences window.
 
2. You can select the input device that you want iClapper to use. For instance, you may have a built-in microphone and external microphone on your Mac, but you want iClapper to listen for claps on the extrenal microphone. In this case, you can set iClapper to use the external microphone under the Input Device tab in the Preferences window.
 
3. From the iClapper menu bar icon, you can stop iClapper when you want it to stop listening for claps, and then start it again when you’re ready.
 
## Conclusion
 
iClapper is very easy to set up and use – anyone can clap their hands whether loudly or softly. iClapper works with all types of claps and you can even customize it based on the amount of sound that’s in the room where you’re using it.
 
Now it’s easier than ever to control your Mac thanks to iClapper; there’s no typing or mouse clicking necessary.
