# Stop Wasting Your Money on Online Subscriptions - Discover the Savvy Trick to Saving Big Bucks Now!

Do you know how much money you're spending on online subscriptions every month? If not, it's time to take a closer look. Chances are you're wasting a lot of money on subscriptions you don't need or don't even use. But don't worry, there's a savvy trick to saving big bucks on online subscriptions. Keep reading to find out what it is.

## Analyze Your Subscriptions

The first step in saving money on online subscriptions is to analyze what you're currently subscribed to. Make a list of all the subscriptions you're paying for, including the monthly cost. Then, go through the list and ask yourself these questions:

- Do you use this subscription regularly?
- Do you need this subscription?
- Can you find an alternative free option for this subscription?

If you answered "no" to any of these questions, it's time to cancel that subscription. You'll be surprised at how much money you can save just by canceling subscriptions you don't need.

## Take Advantage of Free Trials

Before you commit to paying for a subscription, take advantage of free trials. Many online services offer free trials of their products, so you can test them out before committing to a monthly payment. Just be sure to cancel before the trial ends if you decide you don't want to subscribe long-term.

## Share Subscriptions with Friends and Family

If you have a subscription that allows multiple users, share it with friends and family. For example, Netflix allows multiple users on one account. Split the cost with someone else and you'll save money while still being able to enjoy the service.

## Look for Alternatives

If you're paying for a subscription because it's the only option, do some research to see if there are any free or cheaper alternatives. For example, instead of paying for a gym membership, try working out at home with free workout videos on YouTube. Instead of paying for a music streaming service, listen to music for free on Spotify.

## Negotiate with Service Providers

If you're a loyal customer of a subscription service, try negotiating with them to lower your monthly bill. Call or email the company and ask if they can offer you a lower rate. Sometimes all it takes is a simple ask to save money on your monthly bills.

In conclusion, don't waste your hard-earned money on online subscriptions you don't need or use. Take the time to analyze your subscriptions, take advantage of free trials, share subscriptions with friends and family, look for alternatives, and negotiate with service providers. By doing so, you'll be able to save big bucks on online subscriptions and have more money to spend on what really matters.

## Subscriptions: Everything counts in (small) amounts


Today, most of us own less media than ever before. Forget building collections of albums and movies. Now, most people have extensive digital collections they access through monthly subscriptions.
Unlimited access to tons of content for a cheap monthly fee sounds excellent, but what happens if one platform isn’t enough for all your interests? You end up paying for multiple services, and those charges add up fast.
Netflix is an excellent example of an inexpensive service with lots of content. But certain shows you might want to watch, like “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “The Mandalorian,” are exclusive to Hulu and Disney+, respectively. You’ll pay three monthly fees if you want access to all of it.
To keep your bank account in the black, ditch the services you aren’t using. Once a quarter, designate some time to explore your bank statements and go through the past three months’ charges. 
Identify recurring charges between each statement and write them down. Rank them in order from the most frequently used to the least. Once you’re finished, go through the ones at the bottom of your list and consider any subscriptions you can live without.
Since most services range in price from about $4 a month to around $17, the savings can quickly add up when you cut the ones you don’t use.
But month-to-month subscriptions aren’t all bad. Subscribing for a service for one or two months out of the year can save you money, and you have the whole month to catch up on your favorite shows. Tap or click to learn how to stream whatever you want and save.

 
## Find subscriptions that charge via the app store


Let’s say you’ve finished going over your statements and found all the subscriptions you no longer want. But somehow, it looks like you missed some of the services you use semi-frequently. You may even notice a surprise bill or two you weren’t expecting. How did that happen?
Some subscription services don’t bill you directly. Depending on how you signed up, you might be billed through Apple’s App Store or the Google Play Store. This means your bank statements won’t break down what you purchased through these stores. You’ll only see a flat fee.
Fortunately, there’s a way to find subscriptions in the app stores. iOS users can see their active subscriptions by opening the App Store and tapping on the profile icon in the upper right corner. On the menu that pops up, tap Subscriptions to view, cancel or renew services.
Keep in mind you can’t edit your iCloud subscriptions here. To do that, open Settings and tap your profile name, followed by iCloud. When you’re in the iCloud menu, tap Manage Storage followed by Change Storage Plan to edit your subscription.
On Android, open the Settings app and tap Google, followed by Google Account. Here, you’ll see an option titled Payments & Subscriptions. Tap this, followed by Manage Subscriptions to cancel or renew services.

 
## What’s worth keeping?


Your choice in services and subscriptions comes down to three factors: utility, entertainment value and price. 
Not all streaming services are equal, and some of the more expensive ones lack many benefits found in cheaper ones. Don’t forget you can always cancel the monthly streaming subscriptions and sign back up later if you still miss them.
In the case of iCloud, it can even prevent you from losing your data (or phone, for that matter). iCloud will automatically back up your data each night when it’s plugged in and connected to Wi-Fi, and the Find My iPhone feature on iCloud.com can help you track your phone if you lose it.
With iCloud, you pay for storage space — and the more stuff you keep on your device, the more storage you’ll need. As a result, you should prioritize your backup system if you value the data on your phone. This makes it a worthwhile subscription.
If we’re talking about entertainment value, this factor is more subjective. Netflix, Hulu and others all have plenty of good content to enjoy. But as we mentioned earlier, you should weigh the services based on how often you use them and what content you enjoy watching.
Lastly, price is often the deciding factor. This is how you’ll decide whether to break ties with your favorite service and weigh the value of one versus another. One of the best examples is HBO Max versus Disney+. 
Both offer exclusive content, but Disney+ is less expensive than HBO Max. Disney+ costs $7.99 per month, and HBO Max plans begin at $9.99.
Combine the massive Disney library with the fact that HBO’s exclusives are seasonal, and you’ll have a strong case for Disney+. The decision is yours, but direct comparisons are the easiest way to decide what’s right for your budget.
We recommend prioritizing real-life services like cloud storage and shopping, followed by news and entertainment. Games, although fun, are more of a time sink. But if you’re a gamer, an Apple Arcade subscription might take priority.

 
## All together, now


So now that you’ve decided on the services you want to keep, why not officially group them to make payments and budgeting even easier?
A popular method of tracking and paying for subscriptions is paying for them on a single credit card. Each month, all your charges will hit the same card, which means you make only one lump payment. 
It also prevents you from having multiple due dates scattered over the month. Instead, you’ll only need to pay on your credit card’s due date. Of course, this is just one way to manage your subscription services. 
There are plenty of other methods to take charge of your finances while streaming what you want. A great example is paying for a subscription service yearly. As we mentioned, there are benefits to paying monthly here and there, but content providers will often cut you a deal if you pay all at once. 
Disney+ costs $79.99 for a yearly subscription, but if you pay month-by-month, it will cost $95.88. The annual subscription saves you almost $16 for the year. Do this for your favorite subscriptions and save in the long term. Tap or click to learn how else to save money when streaming.
Even if you’re not signed up for every single service, at least you’ll be secure in the knowledge that you’re not wasting money on things you don’t use or need. You can laugh about it all the way to the bank.
