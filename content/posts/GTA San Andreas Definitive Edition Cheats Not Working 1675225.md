Title: Gamers in Complete Dismay as GTA San Andreas Definitive Edition Cheats Fail to Work: Is the Game Broken?

Subheading: Fans of the Grand Theft Auto series are experiencing frustration over issues with GTA San Andreas Definitive Edition's cheat codes.

Introduction: 
Grand Theft Auto has been a staple among the gaming community since its inception in 1997, with the fifth instalment alone earning over $1 billion in its first three days. With such a strong following, it is no surprise that the release of the remastered edition of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was highly anticipated. However, gamers across the world have expressed dismay over issues with the game's cheat codes. Many of these cheating enthusiasts are furious, as their attempts to use the codes have failed.

Body:
Cheating is an integral part of playing Grand Theft Auto, as it allows gamers to access a range of benefits and make the game more enjoyable. From spawning upgraded cars to increasing ammo capacities, the cheats add an element of entertainment to the game. However, since the release of San Andreas Definitive Edition, players have been reporting that some cheats are not working as intended.

One user on the GTA subreddit claimed that the "WORSHIPME" code did not work, despite entering it correctly. Another user reported that "HESOYAM," which replenishes health and armor, did not work either. These reports have sent the gaming community into a frenzy, with many expressing frustration and wondering if the game is broken.

Rockstar Games, the developer and publisher behind the Grand Theft Auto series, has yet to comment on the issue. Some users suggest that the release of San Andreas Definitive Edition was rushed, leading to the game's problems. They cite the fact that the game was only announced a few weeks before its release as evidence.

Others speculate that the problem might be with the coding of the cheat system, as opposed to the game itself. The cheat system in Grand Theft Auto is designed to operate as a set of scripts, meaning that even minor changes to the game's code can cause conflicts that result in the cheats not working.

Conclusion:
For now, it seems that gamers will have to play San Andreas Definitive Edition without the aid of cheat codes until a patch is released. The issues surrounding the game's cheats highlights the importance of careful planning before releasing a remastered game. Not only can rushed releases lead to broken games, but it can also cause consumers to lose trust in the publisher. For now, curious gamers will have to wait to find out what is really happening with San Andreas Definitive Edition's cheats.
