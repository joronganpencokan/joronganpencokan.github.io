Are you struggling to carry all the equipment you need to take on the toughest challenges in Elden Ring? Do you find yourself constantly burdened by your gear and unable to move with speed and agility? Fear not, for we have the ultimate guide on how to maximize equip load in Elden Ring, unlocking hidden secrets that will help you achieve ultimate power and mobility.

First things first, let's take a look at what equip load is and why it's important. Equip load is the amount of weight your character can carry, which affects their movement speed, dodge roll distance, and stamina regeneration. If you're carrying too much gear, you'll move more slowly, dodge less effectively, and struggle to maintain your stamina in combat.

To maximize your equip load in Elden Ring, you need to focus on a few key strategies. The first is to invest in the right stats. Strength and Endurance are the primary stats that affect equip load in Elden Ring, so you'll want to prioritize leveling these up early on. Strength will increase your overall carrying capacity, while Endurance will increase your stamina regeneration and reduce the penalty for heavy gear.

Once you've invested in the right stats, it's time to start selecting the right equipment. In Elden Ring, the weight of your gear is determined by its physical size, with heavier weapons and armor taking up more space than lighter ones. This means that you'll need to be strategic about which weapons and armor you choose to carry, making sure to strike a balance between protection, mobility, and damage output.

To further maximize your equip load, you can also invest in certain skills and abilities. For example, the Light Armor Mastery skill will increase your movement speed and dodge distance when wearing lighter armor, while the Heavy Armor Mastery skill will reduce the penalty for wearing heavy armor. Similarly, the Vitality Surge ability will increase your stamina regeneration, which can be a lifesaver in prolonged fights.

Finally, it's important to remember that inventory management is key when it comes to maximizing your equip load in Elden Ring. You'll need to be constantly assessing which items and gear are essential, and which ones can be safely discarded or stored. Make use of the storage options available in the game, and don't be afraid to sell or trade in gear that you no longer need.

By following these strategies and unlocking the hidden secrets of equip load in Elden Ring, you'll be able to achieve ultimate power and mobility, taking on any challenge that comes your way with ease. So don't hesitate – start exploring this amazing world today, and discover what it truly means to be a master of the ring!

You should increase your Equip Load in Elden Ring no matter if you are in the Early game or post-game. It is a stat that greatly influences your combat and how you fight the different enemies in the game. It does that by determining how fast your character rolls and the recovery speed of your stamina. So in this guide find out how to increase Equip Load in Elden Ring.
 
## How to Increase Equip Load in Elden Ring
 

 
There are 2 ways to increase your Equip Load in Elden Ring.
 
- Increase your Endurance Level
 - Using Talismans
 - Great-Jar’s Arsenal
 - Arsenal Charm
 - Erdtree’s Favor

 
Let us check both methods.
 
- Great-Jar’s Arsenal
 - Arsenal Charm
 - Erdtree’s Favor

 
### How to Increase your Endurance Level
 
Increasing your character’s endurance level is super easy.
 
- Eliminate enemies and stack up on Runes.
 - Once you have enough Runes to level up your character go to any site of grace.
 - Rest there and choose level up.
 - Now here increase your Endurance level.

 
### Using Talismans to increase your Equip Load in Elden Ring
 
Elden Ring has many Talismans that you can equip to improve your character. The three talismans mentioned below help you by increasing your maximum Equip load.
 
- Great-Jar’s Arsenal
 - You can get this Talisman by completing the Great-Jar’s Trial.
 - Fast travel to the Isolated Merchant’s shack site of grace and go north towards the colosseum.
 - Here talk to the Great-Jar and it will enable three red summon signs down the path you came from.
 - Summon all three of them and defeat them in a single life, i.e. without using any site of grace.
 - After defeating the three summons go and talk to the Great-Jar and it will give you the Great-Jar’s Arsenal Talisman.
 - Arsenal Charm
 - You can get this item by following Nepheli’s questline.
 - Go east from the Secluded cell and you can find her in a room.
 - Exhaust her dialogues.
 - Next, you can choose to summon her for fighting Godrick the Grafted. This is an optional step though.
 - Defeat Godrick the Grafted.
 - Go to the Roundtable hold.
 - First talk to Gideon Ofnir.
 - Next, go and talk to Nepheli and she will give you the Arsenal Charm Talisman. In case, she isn’t present then fast travel to Godrick’s site of grace and back to see if she appears.
 - Erdtree’s Favor
 - Go to the Stranded Graveyard site of grace.
 - Next, use two Stonesword Keys on the Keystones.
 - Now keep going down until you see a bridge-like path. Beware of the wheel trap and enemies that attack you while going down.
 - Once you reach the area don’t cross the bridge instead drop or jump down.
 - Again go down the natural path. You can choose to fight or run past the enemies. Although it is better to eliminate them as there is fire here that you need to dodge. So if you run past them there is a great chance these enemies will come to attack you.
 - Now head past the structure that was launching fire at you.
 - Once you reach down you will see a bridge-like path at the end of it you will find Erdtree’s Favor Talisman.
 - Cross the bridge and turn left to dodge the Grafted Scion and immediately grab the Talisman.
