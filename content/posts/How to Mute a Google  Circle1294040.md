Silence Your Google Circle with One Easy Trick - Say Goodbye to Annoying Notifications Forever!

Google has revolutionized the way we connect with each other in today's digital age. Through its social networking site, Google+, we can effortlessly stay connected with friends, family, and co-workers no matter where they are in the world. But with connectivity comes the downside of notifications that can quickly pile up, causing much annoyance and hindering productivity. If you're a Google+ user, you know what we're talking about. Notifications can be overwhelming, with a constant barrage of notifications coming from practically everywhere. Fortunately, there's a quick solution, and in this article, we’ll show you how you can silence your Google Circle by using one easy trick and say goodbye to annoying notifications forever!

Step 1: Select Google+ Settings

The first step towards stopping Google+ notifications is by selecting 'Settings' from the dropdown menu located in the upper right-hand corner of your screen. From the available options, select "Google+ Settings." You'll immediately be redirected to a new page where you can configure your notification settings.

Step 2: Adjust Notification Settings

Once you’re in the Google+ Settings section, locate the 'Notifications' section. You'll find a list of notification types that you can adjust based on your preferences. Select the type of notification that you're tired of receiving, and you'll see a drop-down menu of options. From here, you can choose to silence notifications for that type altogether, keep only the most important ones, or turn off notifications about that particular category entirely.

Step 3: Choose Your Notifications Wisely

One easy tip for managing your Google+ notifications is to choose them wisely. You don't need to receive notifications for every circle that you're a part of. Instead, focus on the critical ones, such as work or personal circles. For instance, you may choose to receive notifications about your work circle, but leave your personal circle's notifications muted.

Step 4: Customize Your Notifications

If you want to get even more custom with your notifications, you have the option of customizing them further. You can choose to receive notifications only from particular people within a circle, or people outside of a circle. You can also choose to receive notifications via email or phone.

Step 5: Mute Popular Posts

Are you tired of receiving notifications about popular posts in your circles? Muting them is the best option for you. By selecting a specific post, you can mute notifications related to that post.

Do you have extra chatty people in your Google+ Circles? You know, those people that post way too much and drown out the quiet ones that don’t post as much? Well, if you’ve been thinking of removing them from your Circles, think again.
 
There’s an easy way to hide posts from that chatty people while staying connected on Google+, and that’s by muting them. You can’t mute a single person, but you can create a new Google+ Circle and mute that entire Circle.
 
Here’s how:
 
1. Create a new circle and add those that you want to mute to that circle.
 
To do this, click on “Circles” in the right column and drag the each person to the empty white circle; this will create a new Circle.
 

 
2. Name the new Circle and then go back to the Home stream.
 
3. Select the Circle that you’ve just created from the “More” menu at the top of your Home stream.
 
4. Now with that Circle selected, use the slider opposite the menus to mute that particular Circle: drag it all the way to the left side.
 
That’s it. That Circle will now be muted and you won’t see any posts from those users in your Home stream. Best of all, they won’t even know that they’ve been muted; you won’t have to hurt anyone’s feelings.
