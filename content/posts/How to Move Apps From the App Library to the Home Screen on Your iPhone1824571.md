Unlock The Secret To Customizing Your iPhone Home Screen In Seconds - Here's How To Move Apps From The App Library!

If you're like most iPhone users, you likely have a home screen that's cluttered with app icons. With so many useful apps available, it's easy to accumulate a lot of them over time. But scrolling through dozens of apps to find the ones you need can be frustrating and time-consuming. That's where the App Library comes in. Introduced in iOS 14, the App Library automatically organizes your apps by category, making it easier to find the ones you need quickly. But did you know that you can also move apps from the App Library to your home screen in just a few seconds? Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Open the App Library

To access the App Library, swipe left on your home screen until you see a screen filled with app icons. This is the App Library, which categorizes apps by type.

Step 2: Locate the app you want to move

Scroll through the App Library until you locate the app you want to move to your home screen. If you have a lot of apps, you might find it helpful to use the search bar at the top of the App Library screen to find the app more quickly.

Step 3: Press and hold the app icon

Once you've found the app you want to move, press and hold the app icon until it starts to jiggle.

Step 4: Drag the app icon to your home screen

With the app icon jiggling, drag it out of the App Library and onto your home screen. You can place the app icon anywhere you like on the home screen, just like you would with any other app.

Step 5: Exit jiggle mode

Once you've placed the app icon on your home screen, you can exit jiggle mode by tapping the screen outside the app icon. Your app icon should now be firmly in place on your home screen.

Moving apps from the App Library to your home screen is a great way to customize your iPhone and make it easier to access the apps you use most. But don't stop there. With iOS 14, you can now create custom app icons using images and photos from your camera roll. This allows you to personalize your home screen even further, giving it a look and feel that's all your own. By combining these features, you can create an iPhone home screen that's not only functional but also uniquely beautiful.

In conclusion, moving apps from the App Library to your home screen is a simple but powerful way to customize your iPhone in seconds. Follow the steps outlined above and start designing your perfect home screen today.

##   How Do I Put an App Back on My iPhone Home Screen?  
 

If you used to have an app on your iPhone’s home screen, and it isn’t there anymore, it’s probably still accessible through the App Library. To put the app back on your home screen, you can either long press the app in your App Library and select the move to home screen option, or drag the app from your App Library to the home screen.

 

Here’s how to move an app from your App Library to the home screen:

 
- From the home screen, swipe left until you reach the App Library.
 - You may only need to swipe once, but you will need to swipe several times if you have a lot of home screens. Don’t stop until you arrive at the App Library.
 - Locate and long press on the app you want to have on your home screen.
 - If you keep holding your finger on the app even longer, you will eventually be able to drag it to the home screen manually.
 - Tap Add to Home Screen.
 - The add to home screen option will not appear if the app is already on the home screen, even if it’s on a hidden home screen. Instead, you need to push and hold the app until the screen flips back to your home screen, then drop the app there.
 - The app will appear on your home screen.

 
##   How to Get an iPhone App Back That Isn’t in the App Library  
 

The App Library groups your apps based on various categories, and it’s also designed to provide easy access to apps you use a lot. That means it won’t always display every app you have. If you want an app on your home screen, and you don’t see it in the App Library, then you can find it using the Spotlight search bar in the App Library.

 

From the home screen, swipe left until you reach the App Library.
