Are you tired of manually maximizing the windows of your Mac apps every time you open them? Do you wish there was a way to automatically make your apps open in full screen mode? If so, you're in luck! In this article, we'll show you a simple trick to make your Mac apps open in full screen mode every time.

## Step 1: Open the App You Want to Set to Full Screen Mode

To get started, open the app you want to set to full screen mode. For example, let's say you want to set Safari to open in full screen mode every time you launch it.

## Step 2: Maximize the Window

Next, maximize the window by clicking the green button in the top left corner of the window. This will make the window take up the full screen.

## Step 3: Hold Down the Option Key

With the window still in full screen mode, hold down the Option key on your keyboard.

## Step 4: Click the Green Button Again

While holding down the Option key, click the green button in the top left corner of the window again. You'll notice that the window shrinks a bit and a menu appears.

## Step 5: Select "Zoom" from the Menu

From the menu that appears, select "Zoom." This will set the app to open in full screen mode every time you launch it.

## Step 6: Quit and Relaunch the App

Finally, quit the app and relaunch it to test out your new setting. The app should automatically open in full screen mode.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! With just a few simple steps, you can make your Mac apps automatically open in full screen mode every time you launch them. This trick can save you time and frustration, especially if you use certain apps frequently. Give it a try and see how it works for you!

The full-screen mode on many native Mac applications is great. It takes full advantage of most Mac Retina displays, and it gives you the maximum working space. It also diminishes distractions by hiding the Dock and the status bar. If this is a look you like, you can follow the steps below to make sure some applications always open in full-screen mode on your Mac.
 
## Enabling Resume
 
Macs actually have a featured called “Resume” that allows apps to save their state on close. When reopened, the application will launch itself in the same state. This means reopening any documents you had open and placing windows in the same location as they were on close. This will also capture window settings like full-screen status.
 

 
Make sure the box next to “Close windows when quitting an app” is unchecked. This will allow Resume to function, permitting the app to reload its previous status.
 
## Setting Up Apps
 
Once that’s set, you can set up the apps that you’d like to have open in full-screen mode. For example, if you want to have Safari in full screen, you would do the following.
 
1. Open Safari.
 
2. Set Safari’s window to full screen by clicking the green button in the upper-left of the window.
 
3. Quit Safari.
 
When you reopen Safari, it should still be in full-screen mode. If you want other applications to also open in full-screen mode, you’ll need to open those applications separately and follow the same steps there.
 
You’ll also want to adjust how to quit applications. If you close windows before quitting an application, then those windows will not be saved. Some users, especially those that migrated from Windows, may have developed the habit of closing application windows before quitting the application. Make sure you stop doing this. If you close application windows before quitting, Resume will not function properly, and your application may not open in full-screen mode.
 
## Using Login Services
 
You can also launch applications at login so that they’ll be full screen and ready for you when you open your Mac. Of course, you may also have to navigate out of the windows if your last application opened in full-screen mode. Give it a try and see how it works for you. If it imposes a lengthy startup time on your Mac, you may want to limit the number of apps starting at launch.
 
1. Open System Preferences.
 
2. Select the “Users & Groups” pane.
 
3. Click the “Login Items” tab.
 
4. Click the “+” button at the bottom of the list of applications.
 
5. Select the application you wish to have launched at startup.
 
### On Quit
 
You also have the option to reopen all the applications you have open at the time you shut down your Mac or log out. At the shutdown confirmation window, be sure to check the box that says “Reopen windows when logging back in” before clicking Shut Down or Log Out.
 
## Conclusion
 
The first setting, regarding closing windows when quitting apps, will affect every application on your Mac. However, it won’t automatically make every app open in full-screen mode. You’ll need to set that up individually within each app. Other apps will, however, open in the last state you left them in. If you don’t like this behavior, you can close windows before quitting certain apps. However, be advised: this may be a difficult habit to keep separated from NOT closing full-screen application windows.
