The GreedFall developers from Spiders have announced a new action role-playing game called Steelrising for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC. Players will experience an alternative version of the French Revolution.
 
As part of yesterday’s Nacon Connect event, Nacon and the responsible development studio Spiders, known for GreedFall among others, announced a new action role-playing game called Steelrising, which is coming for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and PC. Although no official release date has yet been mentioned, at least one trailer has been released and some information has been shared.
 
In Steelrising the players are transported to the French Revolution. However, not everything is as one should know from history lessons. You will travel to an alternative version of the French capital and experience how King Louis XVI uses a robot army to terrorize and subjugate its people. With Aegis, you will defend yourself from terrorism and try to change the course of history.
 
“For our latest game, Steelrising, we created a new and original universe especially for the game, and a much more action-focused approach than the gameplay found in our previous titles,” said Jehanne Rousseau, CEO of Spiders Studio. “In Steelrising, you play as Aegis, a robot in female form, a masterpiece that serves as a bodyguard to Queen Marie-Antoinette, to put an end to the massacres carried out by the robot army of King Louis XVI, who seems to have gone mad while trying to suppress the nascent revolution by unleashing an army of out-of-control robots.”
 
“In this version of Paris, you find well-known monuments and others that don’t exist anymore,” Rousseau said. In addition, the developers have put more verticality into the exploration, so you should also look up when exploring the streets of Paris.
 
As soon as more information about Steelrising is revealed, we will bring you up to date information on it. Until then, you can get a first impression of the game from the new trailer below.
