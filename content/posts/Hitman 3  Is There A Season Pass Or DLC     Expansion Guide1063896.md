If you're a fan of the Hitman franchise, you know that the latest release, Hitman 3, has taken the gaming world by storm. This game takes the player on an unforgettable journey to various exotic locations while assuming the role of the deadly assassin, Agent 47.

But, did you know that there's a secret DLC expansion pass that unlocks an ultimate hitman experience? Let's explore the details.

What Is The Hitman 3 Expansion Pass?

The Hitman 3 Expansion Pass is a DLC that unlocks two expansion packs that extend the game's story and allow the player to experience new worlds, challenges and ways to play. This DLC includes:

1. Hitman 3: Seven Deadly Sins

The Seven Deadly Sins is a series of seven different contracts, each of which is based on one of the seven deadly sins. Each contract is a unique assassination mission that will test your skills and creativity as a hitman. The DLC pack also includes new outfits, weapons, and tools that will help you complete the missions successfully.

2. Hitman 3: Season of Lust

The Season of Lust takes place in the beautiful city of Berlin and is centered around one mission: infiltrating a club and taking out your targets. This mission can be played solo or with friends and has various paths and strategies to complete, ensuring a unique gaming experience each time.

What Makes The Expansion Pass So Special?

The Hitman 3 Expansion Pass has been designed to provide extended gameplay, delivering additional content and options to the players. It guarantees endless hours of thrill and excitement, unlike anything you've experienced in the game so far.

Additionally, the DLC expansion pass includes exclusive content that you can't find in the standard game version. From new weapons to new locations, everything about this DLC is fresh, new and exciting.

Why Should You Get The Hitman 3 Expansion Pass?

There are many reasons to get the Hitman 3 Expansion Pass, but here are the top three:

1. Extended Game Life

The main game itself is brilliant, but with the expansion pass, you get more of what you love. It's like getting a complete season of your favorite TV show all at once, and being able to enjoy it all over again.

2. Exclusive Content

The DLC expansion pack gives you exclusive content that you can't play or access with the standard game version. The new missions, weapons, and outfits provide a fresh new gameplay experience that gives you an edge over other Hitman players.

3. Non-Stop Thrills

The new challenges that come with the expansion pass will push you further, help you improve your gameplay, and make you feel like a real hitman. You'll be on the edge of your seat every time you take on a new mission or experiment with a new tool.

In Conclusion

Hitman 3 Season Pass as of right now is a thing of mystery, the last two games provided Season Passes that further extended both games and if you’re wondering when the Season Pass for Hitman 3 will drop, you should read the rest of this guide,
 
## Is There A Season Pass Or DLC For Hitman 3
 
There is no Season Pass or DLC for Hitman 3, the game concludes with an appropriate ending and brings an end to this chapter of Agent 47. Having to add more story content would rob both the character and players from having that effect. However, though there is The Trinity Pack which is the only downloadable content, it features different cosmetics and weapons but there’s nothing that unlocks future content.
 

 
While Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 had Season Passes or DLC where players could extend the story and narratives of the game, it looks highly unlikely that IO Interactive will wish to add more to this exciting story that combines all three games together to give you a complete story arc.
